<bos> PICARD: Come. Timicin. Time for you to leave us,then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You always did have a flair for the dramatic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is this place, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can the old form still be used? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was what? I tell you, Deanna, for atelepath, your mother's accuracy leaves much to be desired. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo Three, half impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. How many more colonists do you haveto transport? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue transmitting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How could the Romulans plant a bomb onboard a Klingon attack cruiser? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Doctor <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can we beam up the injured? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I should be getting down to the planet. Commander Rikerwill be available here to show you anything that you want to see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Data. Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it's just a jumble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With the Borg threat, I decided that my officers and I neededto hone our tactical skills. In a crisis situation, it is prudent tohave several options. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he still tending grounds, or have the years finally caughtup with him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something is blocking communication both <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that. No, no, back. Yes, that. Right there. What is that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does that programme tell you about what you're doing toGeordi? About what you and Lore are doing to the Borg? It tells youthat these things are wrong, doesn't it, Data? So how can actions thatare wrong lead to a greater good? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't do that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understanding has made friends of many different people. We'vehad a good beginning, Lutan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A respiratory aliment? Is it contained? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He understood. We should have access very soon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise encountered a probe that had been sent from theplanet before it was destroyed. It had scanned me and I lostconsciousness, and in the space of twenty five minutes I lived alifetime on that planet. I had a wife, and children, and a grandchild. And it was absolutely real to me. When I awoke, all that I had left ofthat life there was the flute that I had taught myself to play. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well. it's certainly very exciting work. I've kept up on it inthe journals. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in heretogether. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In time, Mister Data. When we're better prepared. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will address me as Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Counsellor, with regard to my lecture, what do youthink would provide greater clarity? A chronologicalstructure, or the division of each excavation's findings into variousreligious, sociological and environmental sub-groupings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you and your husband be staying with the ship, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A legacy of your Progenitors, Radue. The source of your powerand of your problems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's taking a risk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Peace envoy, in a stolen Vulcan ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We agreed you would never trouble my ship again! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any trace of the other vessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What brings you here, Q? Have you been banished by theContinuum once again? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What launching? What's he talking about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. Heselected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss asstatic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd be happy to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Override. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can you locate the signal? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Duras died in disgrace. By Klingon tradition, his family shouldshare that disgrace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, Iwould say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground, struckdown by the gods. And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying, 'he who wasmy companion through adventure and hardship, is gone forever. First Officer's log, supplemental. Despite the riskof war, I have no choice but to break the stalemate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get him out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you believe the Mintakans arecapable of harming Counsellor Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't we, Admiral? In all these discussions, no one hasever mentioned her wishes. She's a free, sentient being. What are yourwishes, Lal? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It does to me. I want to know what has happened to Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A nursery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor. Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge forthe next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health forthese negotiations, and he might require your services. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then this moon is a penal colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Angel One's strategic importance in this quadrant may becomevital. Starfleet's hope is that one day this world may become part ofthe Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. We have an environmental system malfunctionon the Bridge. Acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask the Admiral some questions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono? You all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I think they'll make a fine addition to the Federation,Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, actually, I wasn't <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you were, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is that the trouble I believe it is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, Wesley's alive and he's well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up acommand post and begin mapping out a search plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It may be dangerous to take the ship in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, please sit down. Well, we have a problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't expose the Enterprise until I know where this diseasecame from and how it is transmitted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll take it here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the Hromi Cluster. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The southern pole? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of. But you mustn't compromise yourself. You must do what you have to do. Because if I find that my head of Stellar Sciences isn't beingeffective, then I shall do what I must to do and I shall replace her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are the engines operating normally? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll respect your wishes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life form readings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That there is room for discussion, Radue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How different? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A rift? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like to see her now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then he will die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is not a rock on the trail which once seen can easilybe avoided. This is much more complex. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They could be cloaked, or otherwise shielded. Mister Crusher,bring us in well clear of the planet's three moons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to find out how widespread thiseffect is. Contact Starbase Twenty three, that's the nearest outpost. Have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs oftemporal reversion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doesn't it? Our very presence may have damaged, even destroyed,their way of life. Whether or not we agree with that way of life orwhether they're human or not is irrelevant, Number One. We areresponsible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do I really seem that different? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, resume programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're glad to be of help, Doctor. TheEnterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Several friends and I were on leave at Farspace StarbaseEarhart. It was little more than a galactic outpost in those days. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did your scans provide any insights into these comas? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sorry, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me see. This way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't even know if this catastrophe is preventable. Call aconference in my quarters. All senior staff. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seems you're right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have fought a pitched battle with it, and lost. Many of mycrew have been injured including a woman who's mind is slowly beingdestroyed by telepathic manipulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, she survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going tofind her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. Mysense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would bebest if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Thehunt begins, Number One. RIKER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good evening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have time to argue. You must go now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I switched the transponder codes. Given his feelings about me,it seemed a sensible thing to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about his mother? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'mpec. May we have a short recess? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, put us back on course. Warp three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Neither do I, Counsellor. How soon can you beat Galorndon Core, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Specify, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. Status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That table. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: However, I have, I believe, turned up some new information,that, if nothing else, raises a whole new set of mysteries and I hopethat we can discuss them here together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much longer until we clear the rift? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That wouldn't be wise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassianpresence here for another six weeks. Your arrival here may have upsetsome very delicate negotiations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Dirgo, I would appreciate it if you didn't bury mebefore I'm gone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume the work is progressing on the conference room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you coming, Mrs. Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. When it's done I want you to find some way of collapsingthis anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis ofwhatever solution you come up with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who was the last person to speak with her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riva id deaf. These three speak for him. Treat them asinterpreters. Address yourselves directly to Riva. Now, may I presentmy First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think the chances of that is remote. And if you will bestill, Mister Elbrun, you may learn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough then Iwould begin to see some kind of pattern. So far, nothing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it alreadyhas, eh, Professor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, Iknow what we have to do! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need tointroduce them to anyone new. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're launching it now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done. Mister Worf, coordinate your teams with DoctorCrusher and Commander La Forge. Assess damage and injury. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Go into the cockpit, and look for a small comm. panel inthe instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet. Eventually you wear it out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at thosememories some other way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before theconference begins. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates andWill's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statisticsand glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I wasabout to put it aside and look at another file and then somethingcaught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will wasFirst Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam downduring a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a generalcourt martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knewthat I had found my Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right, now come on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not up to us to judge their laws, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase power to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, no! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, keep them out of my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So be it. Wyatt seems a fine young man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For the first time since I've known you, I don't believe you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. Perhaps your system of law and punishment isbetter than any system we once had. But we do now have a law I mustobey. And part of it says I must protect my people from harm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about, Data? Is this still SherlockHolmes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good hunting, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we're agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meeting adjourned, then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge is my Chief Engineer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll have to make course changes manuallyuntil we re-establish the connection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask youthat. But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, andyou know what happened to them. What will happen to them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands, this is the Captain. As you may know, the sunin the Delos system is undergoing large-scale magnetic field changes,producing violent, gigantic flares. Now, we shall be studying this starat close range. Even though we shall be running with full deflectors,the closeness of this event and its severity are going to createproblems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seal off all decks. Lock on transporters to the intrudersignals. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees tostarboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said there is no cure for Iverson's. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, take us out of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much hytritium did we manage to bring on board? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will make the Khitomer massacre files available to anyone whowants them. To the High Council, to the Duras family, to you. Anyone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, you can pull it away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My word! High praise from a Vulcan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find outwhat's going on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As Lieutenant Worf discovered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's find out. Computer, discontinue holodeck simulationcreated by Professor Moriarty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you strengthen the graviton pulse? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, I want to make absolutely surethat you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving upyour status as Federation citizens, any future request you or yourpeople make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your ownand under Cardassian jurisdiction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! I want my father! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I never wanted to become <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he has nothing to give us, we should kill him now and bedone with it. Everyone seems to recognise that fact except you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, you must do what I tell you. Reduce yourvelocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees,now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reachthe centre? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you, MisterCrusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, andthey fell in love. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will youplease explain why you attacked us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remmick! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More like a late twenty-second century interplanetary journey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Darwin Station, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As in Admiral Rossa? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some other time perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is this place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be allright <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in arematch. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is in no way dangerous? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Endar's entire claim on Jono is based on Talarian custom he'dhave a hard time backing away from it now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased you agreed to meet with us, Mister Keeve. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, to you, Lal is a new android. But to Data, she's hischild. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nuria, your people live in huts. Was it always so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sounds a little like a young lieutenant commander I oncerecruited as a first officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise. Code fourteen. Lock on present coordinates. Twosecond delay. Mark! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it be what's left of the Fleming? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're right, Q. You gave me the chance to change and I tookthe opportunity. But I admit now, it was a mistake. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain's log <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the boy in any danger? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will assume that we'll be searching for them. He'll find some way to send us a message. Mister Worf, I want continualmonitoring of Ferengi subspacefrequencies. Mister La Forge, can you extend our sensor range? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the question remains, why? What is its purpose? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell? But he's one of Starfleet's finest captains. Hemust have had provocation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Certainly. This way. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister McDowell, alert the main shuttlebay to have allavailable ships and pilots standing by in case we need them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your advice and concern, but this is not the timefor rash actions. We are still investigating. There are three other stations in this sector we have to visit. Let'sproceed in a calm and orderly manner. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've only had a chance to glance at them. I've a few ideas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why is that? What is this cargo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The two Ornarans are really quite ill and insisting that theyneed felicium. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the possibility exists, no matter how slight, that theseexocomps are lifeforms, then we must examine that possibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course to intersect with the freighter. Warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any problems reported in that area? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Release the exterior hull plate. We mayhave to jettison the core. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it isn't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's nothing unusual about that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stunsetting? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lutan, you have granted us hospitality and the safety of yourCentreplace]. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thankyou. And now, according with the customs of your ancestors, whom wehonour and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return ofLieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuitytransmitter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what information can you give us about the inhabitants ofthis system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I don't. It just saddens me to see you burdened with theknowledge things you can't change. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are still investigating that. As soon as <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't have to. They already knew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Other comments? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Intruder alert. Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, you will accompany the Doctor to the surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many people are down there? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yamato, this is the Enterprise. Yamato, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to the Bridge <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You read all this, telepathically? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship in the bottle. Model air ships. I used to build themwhen I was a child. My God, I bet I had a Promellian battle cruisertoo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We have toproceed very carefully. So the first task is to test Mister Data'shypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They are security officers from the twenty seventh century. They're here to take back the Uthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So long as Moriarty has control of the ship, we are vulnerable. Somehow, I have to find a way of giving him what he wants. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Projection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not in the slightest. Except for his features, there is nothingabout him that I find familiar. Counsellor, I want you to stay withhim. He will be able to communicate with you before any on else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transportersdo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Against your wishes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, we have analysed your problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, I assure you <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is this possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't believe that my career in Starfleet has been amistake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not bad. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My ship's company and I are certain of your gentle wisdom inthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that a problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should have listened to me at the beginning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ro Laren? From the Wellington? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, three to transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my orders, not before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine. You want to be treated as a human? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. Ithink it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that willall change once I'm back on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel, we are awaiting your response. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No signs of phaser burns on the hull. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, that's quite true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am. The last time I had to train like this was for theAcademy marathon, but I'm managing. What can I do for you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have completely recovered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Data, all communication with this life form must cease. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I can't tell you that yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what's the date? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate emergency bulkheads in turboshaft four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a fuel containment leak? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, has there been any response to our hails? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indulge me, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, they have not arrived at a solution either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I offer you some refreshment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I see you gifts have been well received. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've heard, Data, and I would be delighted to offer anyadvice I can on understanding women. When as I have some, I'll let youknow. Second Officer's personal log, stardate 44935.6. After conferring with my colleagues regarding the nature of romanticlove in general, and my own situation in particular, I have reached adecision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, return to synchronous orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to stop it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on thisfrequency? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The honour is ours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, I came to see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They very nearly did. Mister Locarno made an impassioned pleafor the rest of you. He said that he'd used his influence as squadronleader to convince you to attempt the Kolvoord manoeuvre and then tocover up the truth. He asked to take full responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: History is aware of the role you played, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter when they werebeamed aboard? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must have triggered something left over from the Erselropewars when the arms business was booming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Must have been terrible when the colony was fighting for itslife. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of us is hungry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've lost three plasma relays on the disruptors. Auxiliarypower is, is not available. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want some better options. Data, Geordi, take Doctor Rabal andbegin an analysis of the rift. We need to find some way to get theFleming out of there. Second Officer's log, stardate 47312.1. Our newsensor readings have greatly improved our understanding of the rift. However, we have been unable to find any way to counteract it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasmaconduits. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them onready status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am aware of that, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And your search led you to me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we still beam the affected sections out into space? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collectedover the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. Andthis, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it you wanted to see me about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I've decided to conduct an experiment of my own. I wantto see how you react to being imprisoned. 1+4 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much danger from that star? Worse case. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ian, could you tell us why you are here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may test that assumption at your convenience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then should we try to keep her asleep? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Release him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it you really want? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must betwo hundred metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But Idon't think that it really is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We seem to be in some kind of undergroundstructure, but I don't see any. Hey, no, you don't. No time to sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, if what you say is true, then this is not GeordiLa Forge. Are you certain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How widespread is this movement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a coastal city that has been neutral throughout theconflict. Both Seronians and Rekag loyalists live there. It might beacceptable as a compromise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you help us locate him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Especially since we know so little about their origins. But I think that I have constructed some plausible theories of my own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trilithium resin is a highly toxic wasteproduct produced by our engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This hearing is convened on Stardate 44780 as a continuinginquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. Mister Tarses, foryour own protection, I have assigned a counsel to you in the person ofCommander William Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you get a direct look at it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to offend you, Gul Dolak, but we cannot withdraw. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freighter, we're going to lock on the tractor beam and pull youout of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Battle of Maxia. I've never heard it referred to sodramatically before. My sincere regrets, Bok, but that vessel refusedto identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Passenger accommodation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Clara, if we need your help again, I hope we can count on you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Several? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But according to the legend, the Stone was destroyed by thegods when the Vulcan people found the way to peace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How close to the Cardassian border are we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulans could use this technology as a weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you mention this earlier? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, where is Lieutenant Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have they given any hint of what they've been waiting for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look Corey, we're not cadets anymore. We're officers. We shouldstart to set a higher standard for ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbolbelong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling apath, crossing a boundary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that what made the Aldeans sterile? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And in the hands of a con artist, fear can be used to motivateobedience, capitulation, the exploitation of innocent people. And thatis what I believe has happened here. I intend to prove that. I need tofind a loophole, some way of challenging the validity of this contract. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any evidence to support this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That doesn't suggest a Romulan connection? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said that the message came directly from Ambassador Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, exactly what do you think the Federation has done? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, I really like running around the ship in my barefeet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, get them up, now. Transporter Room]CRUSHER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At Tanagra. I remember the words but I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, would you escort the Professor to his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Initiate recovery procedures. Continue repairs. Plota course for the nearest starbase. Captain's log, supplemental. With the transporter repaired and my crewsafely back aboard, we have officially ended our first Starfleet battlesimulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of the others? They'llall die when the cargo bay hatch is blown. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase power to the shields. Hold us here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A long time to wait to see if you're right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No further questions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, access Captain Donald Varley'spersonal log. Search parameter. Locate entries containing words Romulanand or Iconia. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm not dressedproperly. I'll be back.  LEECH <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Corey, listen to me. This is a big mistake. Don't play him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion withyour mother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the threetime periods is what is causing the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's alive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of vessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find it hard to believe that you are doing this for thebenefit of my soul. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Father and son. Both proud, both stubborn, more alike thaneither of them were prepared to admit. A lifetime spent buildingemotional barriers. They're very difficult to break down. And now thetime has come, it's too late. It's a difficult moment. It's a lonelyone. It's a moment Spock is about to face. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to thewishes of their Captain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're wrong. If you leave, the Enterprise will be destroyed. Don't you remember? You saw it happen. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you hear us now? Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, send out a series of class-four probes to surveythe far side of the sphere. Perhaps we'll have more luck with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you'resupposed to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He asks your forgiveness. This conflict was started by mistakeson both sides. Let's agree to end it here and now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. It's several kilometres to find another way around thatridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's aforcefield protecting it, but we can find some way to deal with thatwhen we get there. Come on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't worry, I won't move. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your concern is noted, Doctor, but anyintervention on our part would alert the Borg to our having been here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, Doctor Brahms, congratulations. You've weanedthe baby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Worf can deal with anything that might arise. How's yourpatient, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ambassador. Please, sit down. We have entered orbit. Weshall be transporting you to the planet in a few minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty fourhours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed withoutincident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face somecritical test. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, how do we get out? Mister Data, could youreconfigure the sensors to detect these anomalies? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can see that. I'm sure the Federation will want to helpin any way that it can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Play back the Captain's last entry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Her powers are, at the best, unclear. Think about it, MisterWorf. Transporter technology can make things appear and disappear. Theillusion that she can transform herself into a Klingon creature couldbe createdby holographic projection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen, Tog, I must possesses Lwaxana. And if that meansdestroying your ship in the process, so be it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Theorise. What could have caused such a catastrophicmalfunction? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, begin a scan of the interior surfacefor life forms. I want to know who brought us in here and why. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. Yousimply cannot let this civilisation die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you destroy this ship, then others will come in search ofus. You may not be able to stop them all. Knowledge of yourcivilisation would be spread across half the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's head for the closer one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was concerned. I came to see if I could be of any help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, Commander, make it so. Meanwhile, we will maintain ourpresent course. If there is something wrong with Data, wedon't want him to be aware of our suspicions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's a second energy beam. It's coming from the Enterprisedeflector array. Do you have any idea what that could be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need water. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to re-adjust the targeting sequence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerableamount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that yousimply imagined <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've not even met him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fascinating! The entire crew going out of control, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about all the people in that world who are totallydependant on their computer? Are they still functioning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just a moment, Number One! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is this first step that Pardek suggests? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon will you be ready to leave Acamar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers fromBynaus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you haven't told us the whole story. How it ended. The partabout Rishon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My experience suggests that they would ignore him. Would youagree? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineerreport to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying you want to back out of this mission? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us to visual range, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do these men want you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And something else? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A mischievous spirit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targetingarray. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you will still be here. In this place. For ever. Alone. Immortal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you. Please, help yourselves to something to eat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of here. The Romulan ship is set to auto-destructand they can't deactivate it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did they leave? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Picard out. I want to speak to her personally abouther son. So you promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor. Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Options? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killedhim for doing it. I think we have to risk it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Depends. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you tell me what manoeuvre this is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anti-time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's the assumption. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister LaForge, give him a hand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Sit down, please. Our situation has becomecritical. The cluster remains completely unresponsive. We have not beenable to alter its course toward the cosmic string fragment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What I would like is to be returned to my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, Doctor Crusher's become concerned that yourparacortical readings have become erratic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, Orta's ships are old and obsolete. They don't evenhave warp capabilities. They couldn't have reached another star system,let alone attacked one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I sleep on it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail. Essentially, what was in the original lab is here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leave us! We've passed your little test. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, we've made better time than I expected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your objection is noted, Mister Worf, but we are directlyresponsible for the death of the parent. We cannot simply wash ourhands of it now. Doctor, we will proceed at your discretion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok'sship. This could all soon be over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Academy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And issue a general distress call. Yes, Mister Data, I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A place where we can watch your people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not adecision I can make quickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, this may prove to be a wild goose chase,but I don't see that we have any other choice, do you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Ferengi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, for what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly! Arranged marriages have been the basis of politicalalliances in many cultures, including our own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take over, Commander Data, I'll be in observation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know, Number One, but she needs our help to get back. Mister Worf, keep your lock on her no matter what happens. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery. Louismentioned the Atlantis project needed a director, and I found myselfactually thinking about it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not exactly. Nothing works just as you hope. If you can't tellus any more, I need to send a team down to the lab. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exit! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After six years, Number One, I don't think I have any excusesleft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La Forge, set course forStarbase Eighty four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl'sprotector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personalrelationships of those under my command, but in this case. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no you're not. It's just that Commander Riker came totalk to me this afternoon. About you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the mostprecious time. Now will never come again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We were friends, nothing more. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, I want you to command the Excalibur. Her crew wasreassigned when she put in for repairs. Geordi, you will be his FirstOfficer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Run it again. Computer, freeze. Call up the intelligence scanof Spock on Romulus. Computer, enhance far left figure and compare. Same man. Pardek. One question answered. What do we know of him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sovereign. Brull! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by to increase speed to warp seven point three. On mymark. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what have you concluded? Does she live or does she die? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Friends, close friends, are few and farbetween. Two of the oldest and closest are Jack Crusher, may he rest inpeace, and Walker Keel. Before various missions split us apart, we werevirtually inseparable. I trust Keel completely. If he felt it necessaryto violate regulations, he must have had a good reason. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your security status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's still time. Ensign, will you work with mister Data totry to remove them safely. If things get worse, we'll use strongermeasures. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has to arrived. They haverequested return of the renegades. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me makeit again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless theyare prepared to do battle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up somestartling results. Will you join us, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, assemble your team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With fist closed. An army with fist open to lure the enemy. With fist closed to attack? That's how you communicate, isn't it? Byciting example. By metaphor. Uzani's army with fist open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thirties? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have no choice. Remember, aim low. Fire in short, controlledbursts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, find a way to defeat that shield. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the risk is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did they come aboard with Doctor Quaice? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it through. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With the contamination? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If it were possible, what would you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possiblyphoton torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way have we mistreated her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Changing course new heading two nine nine mark zero two nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck ten, forward station one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, Number One. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At the moment of separation, we willreverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead andclear of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It must have been terrible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Doctor, you're charging unknown seas. How do we proceed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, will you get those people undercontrol. We cannot afford this continuing distraction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you see what is happening here, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not going to get away with it this time. Picard toEngineering. Transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulseengines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not until we have someplace to go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice Ihad to began with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play itsafe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to chooseis. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try. Mister Data, programme the firing sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you have done a complete investigation, and if youwish to continue it, of course you have my support. But we shall bereaching the Beta Agni system shortly, and I expect you to be rested. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, butit means something. There's some connection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister DeSeve, in your opinion is it possible that we'repicking up a cloaked Romulan ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly. Just as we're checking it out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because her people had contact with theBorg, I have requested Guinan to participate in this conference. Youare aware of what occurred just now in main Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. We will send you home to your wet sand. Picard toRiker. Bring up the lights in the lab, just a bit. Are youbetter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I understand your objections, but I have to considerStarfleet's interests. What if Commander Maddox is correct, there is apossibility that many more beings like yourself could be constructed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They sound hungry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or there is another possibility, Counsellor. This could benothing more than simple <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is old Boothby? I hope he didn't tell you a lot of storiesabout me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not from Nottingham. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you need an undercover operative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare your team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I am trying to get things off on a better note this time. I want to make her feel at ease. I want her to feel that she's welcomeaboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. However, there are circumstances of which you may beunaware. The survivor has suffered a memory loss. He's thereforeill-equipped to defend himself against your accusations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the SeldonisFour convention governing treatment of prisoners of war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eline? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will proceed according to the traditions and the precedentsset down in Klingon law. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. His name was Joshua Albert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not made anymore. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Location? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying someone was communicating telepathically? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should read more history, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you lost your faith in Sto-Vo-Kor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that's what they have. Status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Activate a deflector dish. If we project a particle beam, wemay be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect within the core. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, very good. I've read all this before, you know. It'sabsolutely as it should be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's never seen a bow. It doesn't exist in her world. To you,it's a simple tool. To her, it's magic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened to us in that missing day? Surely there must besome clues. Each of us should try and think what we were doing justbefore we blacked out. Reenact it if you have to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you cantorture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there is a psychology to these creatures, we must discoverit. If there is an explanation for their behaviour, we must know whatit is. Even in your current condition, you are the most qualifiedperson aboard this ship to assist. Data is in Observation attempting toformulate a strategy. I want you to join him. Deanna, we need you. Captain's log, supplemental. If our speed andcourse remain unchanged, in one hour the Enterprise will be torn apartby the gravitational forces of the cosmic string fragment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You sound surprised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf wants you to live. The name of your father must someday becleared. He needs you alive with your honour intact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tuppence. Two pence. Supposed to be good luck. We may needsome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It goes deeper than that. A fine war mare would sleep in abedouin's tent, carry him into battle, feed his children with her milk. There's a bond which is created by mutual need. Hello, beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is being treated for severe injuries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And have you noticed how you and I are now on a first namebasis? Number One, Will, something has happened already. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm beaming you up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, you must have been playing since you were young. Iplayed the piano for a while when I was small, but I didn't put in thepractice you must have. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get that seal back up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I, er, I assumed because of the way you welcomed me the otherday. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig mainphaser banks to deliver an energy beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Without evidence of intent, Number One, it will not be a simplematter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There. Right, then let's get to work. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And good luck. Lieutenant Worf, personal log, stardate 44996.1. Ihave located the Klingon ship on which my brother Kurn serves ascaptain, and have arranged to join him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As are we. For what it's worth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How comforting, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I regret a great many things from those days. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Limit targets to engines and shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, have you secured all of the shuttle debris? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The performance of my crew is none of the Ambassador'sbusiness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The transporter need not pattern your Captain into matter. We'll beam energy only, and we will become a combined energy pattern ofour life forms. A resignation from this command and from Starfleet hasbeen appropriately recorded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know what you're talking about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Ardra's magic. Jared, would you believe me if I toldyou that I could steal her powers and perform the same magical acts asshe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's over, Baran. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, let's proceed without the pipe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why can't you get out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Thank you, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Have you been ableto determine the cause of our transformation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently, that part of the plan didn't work very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: when the walls fell. First Officer's log, stardate 45048.8. Our attemptto transport Captain Picard back to the ship has failed. My options arenarrowing and my patience is all but gone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Thank you. I'm not much good to you, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, will you wait for me in the corridor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me give you a hand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is Doctor Pulaski there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room. You're out of time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resuming previous course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitiancivilisation are said to be magnificent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that feasible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. Happy birthday. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Starfleet keeps me very busy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not we, Number One. I want you and the others to stay hereuntil I return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut up, Wesley! Lieutenant, pick a good security team, let meknow what he does. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will be in orbit around Peliar Zel within six hours. If youcould arrange for the representatives of Alpha and Beta to be there,then Ambassador Odan could beam directly down to the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One. Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, answer the First Officer's question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Send it directly to the aft section of the Raman through thesecondary air lock. That way it should put it just one bulkhead awayfrom the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where has he gone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what do I have to offer Orta that might persuade him tocooperate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitudecontrol and most systems are offline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I mean, why you are here on this ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish to be candid with you, Ensign. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How the hell do you know that, boy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you definitely established that there's someone's insideit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive. Well,you have twelve hours to think it over. And if it's not too premature,congratulations, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understandable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Always, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll, um, we'll take a short recess. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying they beamed the Ambassador off our own pad? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But how could that be? We both saw the woman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is going on here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Patience. Patience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Easy, Number One. Let's find out what it iswe're dealing with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've talked with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But this could be done through diplomatic channels, Admiral. What do you really want of us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope so. What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, I think I've found it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who's the captain of this ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to look through the personnel files ofUtopia Planitia. See if you can recognise any of those faces. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many devices do we think we're dealingwith, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we are having similar difficulties reading you. I amadvising you and your away teamPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Must we destroy them to save ourselves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, I think that we should just forget about this and enjoyout evening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Consider the first time a run-through, a rehearsal toshake out the flaws. The second time will succeed if we leave no clues. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's only one planet in the Kurlan system capable ofsupporting life. Loren Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forbid it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's see if anyone's out there. Mister Worf, attempt a widerange sensor sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put that down, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. Please report to my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to theEnterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were much as my people once were. Savage, warlike. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Prime Minister? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seventy five years is a long time. If you would care to studysome technical schematics or <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, the Kurlan civilisation believed that an individual was acommunity of individuals. Inside us are many voices, each with its owndesires, its own style, its own view of the world. The Kurlancivilisation died out thousands of years ago. It is extraordinarilyrare to find a figurine intact. Professor, this is an incredible find. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you launch another probe. This time a ClassOne with full sensor array. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The lift's falling! Hang on! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any waywe can protect him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll have to be a little more precise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And this is the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must trust each other, Tarr. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He'd probably send us both to bed without our supper. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you for the confirmation, Doctor. But now, except forRiker, I would like you all to return to your stations. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try to wake him, again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, let me see the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we have clearance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reason enough for anyone to go to war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, I've been fortunate to have access to your Betazoidabilities. Most starship captains have to be content with a humancounsellor. Empathic awareness is not a requirement of your position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not taking you anywhere. Captain's log, stardate 41602.1. The shuttlecrafthas been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving theplanet. Vagra Two will be declared off limits. But the damage has beendone. One of the saddest duties I've ever had to perform is now aheadof me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Yes, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am deeply concerned by what is happening here. It began whenwe apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answerfor his crime. But the hunt didn't end there. Another man, Mister SimonTarses, was brought to trial and it was a trial, no matter what otherschoose to call it. A trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothingsubstantive offered against Mister Tarses, much less proven. MisterTarses' grandfather is Romulan, and for that reason his career nowstands in ruins. Have we become so fearful? Have we become so cowardlythat we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a currentenemy? Admiral, let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else,because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocentassociations. I implore you, do not continue with this proceeding. Endit now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes thatthe Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility ofanything closer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a dampening field. This entire structure could be shieldedfrom our sensors. Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I trust the process we have built with the Romulans over thepast four years. They have nothing to gain by betrayal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I convinced them I was a smuggler, and that my name was Galen. I offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen. Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefactsfrom archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has meanalysing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will,they are looking for a specific artefact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried tokill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good histhreat against the boy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, whoever they are, and however they survived, we've got toget them off the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many outposts are there in this sector? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Brand. What can I do for you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Forgive me, Jay Gordon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers knoweach other's abilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My help? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to beuntrustworthy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing toentertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans. But what would the Romulans want with you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We could grant you asylum, Hugh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until we return, then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your advice, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but it's a correct assessment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Premier. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't stop them. I can't. I can't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're running out of time. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That may be so, but it's not my decision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So there are limits to her power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you translate it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're speaking of yourself, Q, not Guinan. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp near that ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, we're outside the door. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I spell knife with an N. But then, I never could spell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am not encouraging him. If you weren't so narrow minded, ifyou allowed him to see the world as it really is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Maybe now we'll get some answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a continuous sensor sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. What is our assignment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force youto disobey his orders. Therefore I will have to remain in the dark onthis mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not letPressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that thattrust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the commandstructure of this ship. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I've had a few years to look it up. Professor, theEnterprise is yours for as long as you're here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Somewhat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stellar Cartography. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that were true, what could three indicate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not unlike a drumhead trial. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's hope. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is that? One of your allies? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggest what the Romulans were doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Enlarge and identify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A very old regulation. Well, make it so, Number One. And reducespeed. Drop main shields as well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I've spoken with Admiral Brand and she's agreed to allowus access to all of the physical evidence and testimony. Thank you,gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but whatever my personal feelings, I haveno jurisdiction here. I simply cannot interfere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, there will be a short delay. Korris has escaped. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all hewanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. Iwish he could find some focus in his life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Replacing the burners. City ordinance. Makes it safer in caseof earthquake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, perhaps it's still alive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have no idea what you're talking about. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to theirquarters, as a precautionary measure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have something else for you, Baran. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is all I ask. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll do my best. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Their lives are in danger and they're beaming over cargo? Number One, I don't understand these people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fifteen years ago, he assembled a team of scientists to expandthat research. They disappeared. Haven't been heard from since. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. That's very, very commendable. And you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All shields to maximum. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your field generator on the planet surface has been sending outharmless energy charges, which this facsimile has been converting intoKrieger waves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. So let's continue on course. Somewhere out theresomething will happen. A decision will be made during the course ofwhich, I will be separated from the Enterprise. At the time, thedecision will seem to be correct, but it won't be. We have toanticipate and not make, not make the same mistake once. Something iswaiting for us out there. Let's try and determine what it is, asquickly as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Advise Starfleet of our status, Mister Data. When AdmiralKennelly calls, I'll speak to him in my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, but I was going to. I would have told him anything. Anything at all. But more than that, I believed that I could see fivelights. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: But in those few seconds, the Enterprise might break free. That's what he, that's what the other Picard must have thought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt. It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we all die, here, now, you will not be able to gloat. Youwanted to frighten us. We're frightened. You wanted to show us that wewere inadequate. For the moment, I grant that. You wanted me to say Ineed you. I need you! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forward sensors are online. Ensign McKnight, plot a course forthe shortest distance out of the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean where you wanted her to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please don't interrupt me, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's excellent, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, will you escort Investigator Krag to TransporterRoom Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Keep me appraised, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, this is Captain Picard. I am prepared to discussthis situation. There is no need for further violence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will not fire on them, Electorine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we are, Number One. What is your status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's unconscious. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to know the root of your prejudice for my First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to pilot the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There must be a lava flow or a underground hot spring somewherenear here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did youlearn anything about the relationship between that and the Edo? Why arethey so certain it's a god? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to Security, I want all your senior supervisors toreport to the Bridge immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know what the infection is? Come on, quickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, get us to Daled as quickly aspossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? Go. Return to your own time. There's nothing for you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energyusage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the boy ready, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps some answers at last. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. As long as they're looking for us, they won't hurt anyoneelse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Contact Gowron's ship. Tell him to meet us aboard K'mpec'svessel. Ambassador, meet me in Transporter room six in an hour. We willbegin the ceremony a little late. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, my dear Louis, two men. Robert's and my father's. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pipe it through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worryabout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prime Minister, even the most comfortable prison is a prison. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please, come in. I'm delighted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What went wrong, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Doctor, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Crewman? What is going on? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, it's a race? An alien intelligence, a new life form,representing a technology far beyond that of either the Romulans orourselves. The Romulans will certainly take whatever measures arerequired to secure this creature for study. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't say that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did they attack the Yamato? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it wasn't. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, Mister La Forge, we aregoing to recreate the research station here on the holodeck. I want youto work with Commander Data on the preparations. In addition, CommanderLa Forge and Commander Riker, I want you to give the computer detaileddepositions of everything you saw, everything you heard while you wereon board. Counsellor, I want you to assist me during this inquiry. Mydecision about the extradition will be based upon the evidencepresented during these recreations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The matter is already decided. You're beaming down to yourworld with the felicium. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cease fire. Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A defection? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But Data, they were already dead. I mean, what more could havehappened to them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannotblindly follow orders. You acknowledge their sentience, but you ignoretheir personal liberties and freedom. Order a man to hand his childover to the state? Not while I am his captain. If you wish, you canaccompany us to Starfleet, where we shall see <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I met him once. What I know of him comes from history books,and of course my mind meld with his father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did endwith the United States taking its place as a dominant world power andcultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century. Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement. Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourthcentury. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, discontinue programme. Computer, exit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some problem, Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, Counsellor <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the Enterprise, we used harmonic resonators to relieve thetectonic pressures on Drema Four. Obviously, it's not the same problembut <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarianship so far off course? What was its point of departure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: School project? Just how far have these things evolved? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Captain is fine, thank you. Mister Data has beenbriefing me on the away team's comportment, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Let's talk. Are you here to relieve me of duty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Conn report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When I realised the paradox. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were not affected? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or against you personally? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It might be viewed as an act of aggression. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Escape? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you'd care to explain why we're here, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only communication that was sent werethe numbers one four zero zero. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I noticed several times during the briefing that you appearedto be a bit distracted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is any of this possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll follow. You go now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, we have made some progress here. Let's not ruin thatwith unnecessary posturing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leave it to Robert to find the best cook in France, then marryher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But how is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I suppose a few moments longer. I'm afraid I can't helpyou, Mister Leech. The game is over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but he didn't take it very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not an answer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have they estimated time for repairs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, out of orbit. Warp five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, I cannot believe that you are notwilling to stay here until we <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted, but how could he perceive his mother visually as ifshe were standing there in the room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tetryons? Like the emissions in the cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The hostages have been freed by Karnas,unharmed, and the body of Admiral Mark Jameson has been buried onMordan, at the request of his widow and by the permission of Karnas. The quest for youth, Number One. So futile. Age and wisdom have theirgraces too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, whenever you're ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, keep an eye on the Cardassian border. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, take us within transporter range. We're going to beamthem aboard directly onto the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not over yet, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: jIlajneS. ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj. I accept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was just part of my memory. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Chief O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp nine point three. How much time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you want someone to accompany you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And quite adamant. Mister Okona, what crimes are you accusedof? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, that was a remarkable performance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage, whatever. Theanswer's there, on the planet. Tasha, I want you to provide CounsellorTroi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests. Psychprofiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent, thepsychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I take that to be a yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we use our sensors to find them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At ease. It's Captain, actually. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's sound advice at any time, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'll sleep here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is very ill, Perrin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Mister Worf, throw him in the brig. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all threedifferent time periods? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're here, the entire crew must know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify it, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which, for a few hours, should provide the emotional controlyou need. In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude thetreaty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am sorry to report your comrade's injuries are beyondour medical abilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Terminate communications. Come with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Moriarty, this vessel's computer has a vast memory capacity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll join you shortly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Phasers and sensors both useless? Mister Data, this reflectionphenomenon, would it have the same effect on a disruptor-style weapon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How about a sandwich? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximumacceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, meansthat we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hopeis to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our onlyother option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth asthey demand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can we be getting a false reading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Familiar, yes, but I can't represent your peoples' interests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's Ressikan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, Admiral, I thought you were sent here to form anopinion, not to justify one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in wasvengeance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As to that, there's no option. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fatalities? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or he may have nothing to do with it at all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! Over here! The door's over here! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We didn't know that. We didn't even know if you were real. Allwe knew was that a little girl's imaginary friend was frightening her,threatening her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was hoping we'd learn more about it. But since we can't, takeus out of here, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get more power to the shields? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine ifit's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. MisterData, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federationrecords. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaulabout fifty years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, I would just like you to know that Commander Riker is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Professor, my crew will continue to investigate, but fornow it would seem you have accomplished a miracle. The question is, nowthat you're here, what do we do with you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My only regret is that your reunion marks Will's farewell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride inyou. His love. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He'll make a fine captain, JP. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A possibility. Captain's log, Stardate 43463.7. We're holding aposition at the Neutral Zone border proximate to Nelvana Three. If ourguest is telling the truth, there are twenty one hours left before theRomulan base becomes functional. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cold. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's an old human expression. Mister LaForge hopes that we'vegot close to achieving what you wanted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, see that the representatives are safelytransported off the ship. Ensign, set a course to intercept with theTrill ship. Prepare to go to warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no. I'm fine <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is something wrong, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, there must be a cure. Some formula, similar to the oldone, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom. I'velearned to trust it. I could arrange for you to speak with her if youwish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As am I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am aware of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. Butwhat you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said thatall of humanity will be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not now, damn it, Q. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have nothing to say to you, and I will resist you with mylast ounce of strength. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We know you've been on this ship for some time now, and thatyou're posing as Clara's friend, and that you've been threatening her. We can only assume that there is some connection between yourself andthe life forms attacking this ship. You're obviously an intelligentbeing. There's no reason to hide from us. Talk to us. Or can you onlycommunicate by threatening a small child? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I want you to put a stitch in time and, er, save muchmore than nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Also, please tell him that I am immensely gratified that he isprospering so well. A tribute to his skilled leadership. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The eruptions have stopped. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here andface me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you herebecause I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take this message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We'll bewatching. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. La Forge, contact Commander Riker. Worf, check alldecks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. Youmentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we may never know. Resume. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, that's takes care of this ward. Time to be moving on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A strategic attaché with specialised knowledge in the frontierregions. I think you'll find the briefing interesting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look at this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up theLife Sciences on this mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by for transport. Picard out. Mister Worf, have allsecurity precautions been taken? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goeswrong in the discussion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontationwith Commander Riker. Computer, play Riker programme four, time indextwenty four one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Launch torpedo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am interrogative, yes, and I would appreciate an explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's how you see it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Traveller? What is your destination? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For what reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She was upset. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But Professor, you're not scheduled to catch the Vulcan shipfor another two days. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beamsomeone away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please do. And Number One? Everything about this seems wrong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as ittravels backwards in time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's very good, but I would like to increase the efficiencyto ninety five percent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not forgetting that. That's the reason he's here and not inthe brig. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To the object in orbit with us. We will remove the humancolonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so. Please tell us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Surprised he's not busy gloating over his victory. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked meto leave the Enterprise, to join him in an archaeological expeditionwhich could last for nearly a year. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If other members of the away team became disoriented, it couldcreate additional problems and perhaps increase the danger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha, set coordinates to beam it back where it came from. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will rot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get it to Sickbay right away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have a number of questions for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Please, come in, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'm going down to the planet myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I was under the impression there was a cease fire agreement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very soon after we combined we had learned much about eachother. A passion for exploration, for the unknown. We found we hadsimilar dreams, and it offered your Captain a way to realise thembeyond human expectations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to ten metres per second. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know of that. Perhaps it will be helpful to both of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scanning us? Why? What could it hope to learn? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had hoped to find that out from you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Data. Neither am I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps a different level of consciousness? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shuttle three to Enterprise. Telemetry link enabled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How about a war? If generations of conflict is killingmillions, do we interfere? Ah, well, now we're all a little less securein our moral certitude. And what if it's not just killings. If anoppressive government is enslaving millions? You see, the PrimeDirective has many different functions, not the least of which is toprotect us. To prevent us from allowing our emotions to overwhelm ourjudgement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish you were faking it. I've seen the thorn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well then, I've saved you the bother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, we cannot exterminate something that may or maynot be intelligent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I came to invite you, and your husband if he is available, to aMozart recital this evening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us out of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, that sounds like a telephone ringer, but I don't seea receiver. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a Borg identification. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By doing what? When? How can <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, will you hailCaptain Maxwell? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was a wise choice, Ensign. It probably saved you fromanother court martial. Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly since wereturned from the surface? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Six hour? The banquet will be completely over by then. That'svery unfortunate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The women. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, an update, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know whathas got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I willtell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every orderyou're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules ofconduct. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Admiral, there's no betterguide into this life for Lal than Data. He's doing an excellent job. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. On my signal, we willgamma-irradiate all computer systems throughout the Enterprise. Let'sput an end to this conflict. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You think that she lied? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Conor, we were unaware that there were human colonies inthis system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've received a distress call. We're changing course tointercept. Captain's log, stardate 44215.2. The Enterprise hasbypassed its scheduled archaeologicalsurvey of Camus Two in response to a distress call from the Federationfreighter Arcos, which has assumed an emergency orbit around TurkanaFour, birthplace of our late comrade, Tasha Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians aredeveloping a new delivery system, one that would protect them fromaccidental exposure to the toxin. They believe that the Cardassians aretesting a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspacecarrier wave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A Corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here. Wehave detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed anylight on this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not a person, damn it, it's a Borg! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is a self-induced catatonic state. Their way of dealing withthe trauma of spaceflight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: New heading two nine nine mark one eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, let's limit their access. But you instruct yourpeople they are guests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. This is Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise,representing the United Federation of Planets. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said that the transporter could be modified to filter outthe changes in Doctor Pulaski? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're becoming quite annoying, Sovak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You picked a wonderful locale. This is something I might havechosen myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On special occasions. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand your position, but I', sure you're aware that theFederation cannot interfere in what is, by definition, an internalKlingon affair. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If her psyche has collapsed in on itself, could accessing hermind pose any danger to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Temba, his arms open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Ardra, will you would do the honours and stop thetremors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us back to Ohniaka Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive this tardiness. Ship's business. Minister Campio,Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you to analyse our sensor readings of theBorg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or analien ship which they captured. Then run an analysis of this subspacedistortion they used to escape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I try it, it will be at a time of my own choosing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not now, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can you beam him out of there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aye aye, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, Lieutenant, the advantage was yours. Come again. Engarde. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have assaulted a Federation starship, killed and woundedseveral members of her crew, kidnapped two of her officers, and youdon't expect a response? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than theenemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You took some unnecessary personal risks, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: it's just that ever since I was a child I've always knownexactly what I wanted to do. Be a member of Starfleet. Nothing elsemattered to me. Virtually my entire youth was spent in the pursuit ofthat goal. In fact, I probably skipped my childhood altogether. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does it work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jason. Your being here? I hope it will give us the chance toget to know each other. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On many worlds we've been to, they are isolated, treated aspariahs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will certainly grant you asylum, when you have been absolvedof this crime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your hypnotism revealed another form of duality? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there's a danger in becoming too detached, of neverpermitting ourselves to get closer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you join me on the bridge, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I'll have to relieveyou of duty and confine you to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean a Tyken's rift. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reduce the input gradually, and still get him out before it'stoo late. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are we talking about hallucinations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Hoy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That'll be all, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rest assured, Gul Dolak, there will be no terrorist attackstoday. We are escorting the Bajoran settlers to their camp on ValoThree. You can monitor their course if you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you happen to know what time the intercessor's office acrossthe way opens? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous. I wasto meet someone. Someone here, at this very table. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have ten. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Method acting? I'm vaguely familiar with it, but why would youchoose such an old-fashioned approach? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not continue have that woman continuing to use this shipfor her convenience, simply because her daughter happens to be one ofmy officers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why would he do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, have you been monitoring all this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, and you are not programmed to murder cowards. So if theywill not fight back, what will you do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard, of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terrorinto their lives? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, if you'll excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmlands here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone willknow very shortly. Carry out my orders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, the Indian Councils is adamant. They refuse to leave Dorvan Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, end Red alert. And try to access a Federation timebase beacon. Let's see if we can find out how long we've been in thiscausality loop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Take us straight through them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Prepare a class one sensor probe. We'll leave itbehind to monitor the final closure. Mister Crusher, lay in a coursefor Archer Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get off my ship. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a physiological cause? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! Do nothing he demands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come and have supper tonight, my friend. I'll make somevegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that they're still alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we had transferred all that warp power to the shields, itwould have torn the ship apart. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the very core oftheir being. How would this affect others on board the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea? Earl Grey. Hot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grand. You're dismissed, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, they've endured generations of sympathy and promises. How can I believe this Orta will be satisfied with more of the same? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well that is your protected right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, try and rest. Take the necessary sleep inducements if youhave to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The nightmares have ended. All I need now is a little time tomyself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Estimated distance to the nebula'sperimeter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, Data, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Risk? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the Romulans would have a legitimate excuse for respondingin force. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time to come home now, Number One. Transporter room, we have afix on the away team. Beam them up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Earth, United States, San Francisco, California. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chancellor Alrik. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec'sship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll go along with that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Ro. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our destiny is elsewhere. But I'm happy that yours is here withus, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of therenearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Council Member Vash. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold on, Jake. It's going to be a little bumpy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The boy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, at your convenience, I would like to talk toyou in my Ready room. Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, acknowledge the signal from New Berlin andtransmit another copy of Starfleet's ship-recognition protocols andtell them to read it this time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, any speculation on what we might find down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I would recommend that before we prepare for combat, wetry to access the ship's logs, find out who we are, what our purposehere might be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An artificially created energy conduit? That could be anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But don't touch anything! Try it out. Thepanel on your right is for log entries, library computer access andretrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No luck? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf went down. I don't know if he's aliveor dead. And there were other casualties. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A beacon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question are, why now? What's their objective? For fiftyyears there's barely a whisper out of them, and now for no apparentreason they seem to be back with a roar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, yes, of course, if all parties request it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what is the state of the shuttle crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How may we be of assistance, Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of oneof my ancestors against his people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any changes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can there be an intelligence at work here? Counsellor, do yousense a lifeform out there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even if I had reason to believe that would be successful, Idon't think that I could sanction it. Please understand, Professor,that you are in essence a new life form. One that we didn't intend tocreate and that we don't fully understand. Now the moral and ethicalimplications of deliberately creating another one like you areoverwhelming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're mistaken. I am ready and willing to discuss theestablishment of full diplomatic relations under the same terms asAmbassador T'Pel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me what you know about this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that she was aboard the Enterprise C whenit was destroyed twenty four years ago, that she was one of thesurvivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between herand a Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guilty of what? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. He must not be lost. He's not simply an android. He's alife form, entirely unique. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to propose a swap. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for thepast three days? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, I have no doubt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I would still make thesame choice I made all those years ago. I just wish that I didn't haveto say no to him a second time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn! I'll call the Doctor again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose this means I can look forward to a week of continualharassment on this subject? I admit, I've been feeling a littlefatigued. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not surethat you will be able to integrate it into yourprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to half impulse. I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's the only chance we have of finding Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still feel that youwant to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your conditiongood? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Predict current vector of Borg ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the mostdifficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into anindestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purposeof the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-likegarden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. Onthe other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinkinginto nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely adelusion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the Klingon ship, the Pagh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Frankly, I think my time would be best served carrying out theduties and responsibilities of a Starfleet Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, there you are. We start rehearsals tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, hardly possible, Number One. Lay in a course to thesource of the signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Elaborate, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are aspects to Riva of which we have not been informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I found these pieces in the tertiarylevel of the dig. They're typical of second century Marlonian cookware. Look at those markings. They're very similar to early Taguan designs,but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranianthan Taguan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do themodifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory asto what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand down from red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. I can't let the soliton wave hit the colony. Youhave three minutes, not one second more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor. It's good to see you again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the original coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did the shuttle's flight logs show where Galen had been beforecoming to the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. This will be fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your empathic powers told you all this about me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any evidence of that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate that. Computer, resume. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it gently. But do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what is your status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What exactly will this work entail? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I plan on leaving the same way you do. On your ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get through it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why wouldn't he tell us the truth? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said he was stationed there for six years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shuttles? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Surely he must have logged the cause of the ship's death. Whatcaptain wouldn't? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us to within twenty kilometres of the test ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A revolving door? Number One, proceed withcaution. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Barron, I cannot, I will not, impose a set ofcommandments on these people. To do so violates the very essence of thePrime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is it coming from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello. It's good to see you again. What brings you to theBridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's your real fear. Never to die. Neveragain to be united with those who left you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This goes against my better judgment. Transporter room three,lock on to shuttle one. Beam it back into it's bay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's begun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's hear the second option. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief, transport them to the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The earliest was some twenty two thousand years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Miller, if I could have prevented this I would have. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you changed the colour of your eyes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut off the power to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, you have entered Federation space despite mywarning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are the modifications to the torpedoescomplete? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You do not leave this ship withoutauthorisation. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you are Borg. Your goal is not to destroy but to assimilateus into the collective. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If this is the Borg, it would indicate they have a source ofpower far superior to our own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explanation, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you finished? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To protect you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're goingto have to put up with me for a long time to come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You want me to give you transportation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there anything we can do to help? You and your staff arewelcome aboard for a change of scene, rest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it so important that you to win one last argument? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. I hope so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. You have an important job to do here. If we are to freeyour mother, then we have to be able to trace the movements of theterrorists. I want you to work with the team that are investigatingthis new technology of theirs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Almost human. With just a bit of a headache. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we tractor them out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Yes, you do, somewhat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our only influence, Minister, is by example. Timicin's decisionis his own free will, I assure you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has the ambassador been delayed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extend shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should go now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look about you, Sovak. By now it must be obvious, even to you. The Uthat is not here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Think of him as someone you caredeeply about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pay off your wager. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. Good work, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the cause? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you wish the bodies returned? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, are you able to return to duty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'd never leave Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ask for her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment, Mister Data. Admiral, this is Picard. May I knowthe reason for this communication? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was a fine man. A man of rare gifts. and greataccomplishments. He will be sorely missed. Does anyone else haveanything to say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are the allegations, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Byleth, this is Commander William Riker, my FirstOffice, from the planet Earth. He has been assigned to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, we don't know where the escape pod is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will take this to Starfleet myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We mean you no harm. Do you believe me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary. I think that synthehol heightens one'sappreciation for the genuine article. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then Riva the mediator <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hmm. Well, we should get some sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was the date when you crashed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to DoctorCrusher's office. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are capable of recreating all of these events. It's justthat she dresses them up and she delivers them with more dramaticflair. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, light. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're a very attractive woman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get a lock on him as soon as you can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Ambassador Odan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire at will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, soon she'll be ship-shape and Bristol-fashion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return me to my ship! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, Q, I thought you told me that I was dead. Now it seems thatI'm alive. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, this ship is less than a year out of Spacedock. What arethe chances of this occurring? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it's true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something interesting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, advise Doctor Clark that the hostages are beingreleased. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But in a sense, that's exactly what happened. Wesley left theEnterprise three years ago he was a boy, and now he's returned a youngman. And that can't be easy for a mother or a son. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man. The first thing it did was todestroy a space vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. Butnow his memory will live on in his namesake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you made this offer to Orta? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not be coerced. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see four lights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, hard starboard! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I would recommend that we ask both sides if they wouldagree to meet in the city of Darthen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you don't deny it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare for a mission Iknow nothing about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's an old navy phrase, meaning everything in perfect order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My First Officer has said that ownership of this cargo is indispute, but this question must be settled by whatever legal mechanismexists between your societies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Durasfrom the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to theRomulan-Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action, but we will bein a position to expose any Romulan supplies that attempt to cross theborder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life form? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nonsense. It is only <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: GeordiPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any suggestions, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In spite of all you've done to me, I find you a pitiable man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. I want to see Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. If anyone needs me, I'll be in my Ready Room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course zero three seven mark zero zero five, warp four. Take us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transfer Engine control to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you said yourself that this is only a possibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in an intercept course for the Romulanship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by takingover our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finishus. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identify them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could see a way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Jared. As I've tried to tell you, you saved your own livesa long time ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's hold this position for a while, Number One. This is worthstudying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Premier Bhavani has no objection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There. Now, Number One, we need a crew to help us get thathatch off. Don'tyou think that Jay here would make an excellent science officer? Whatdo you say, Jay? Will you join our crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, we've had a difficult time with transporterssince we arrived here. That's why we had to send down the shuttle. Youshould all have been aware of that fact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not here to fight your wars for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative, Mister Worf. If we are curious about it, it has aperfect right to be curious about us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But Ardra must have purified the polluted water and air? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that asteroid came from the Pelloris Field. If the rest ofthat field is rich in nitrium, it would make a natural feeding ground. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there is something else, any further courtesy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, perhaps you had better re-examine the Array. Seeif you can find any evidence to support Mister Worf's claims. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not all of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The holodeck has been able to give us woodlands and ski slopes,figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact,but you, you're very different. You adapt. You spoke to me in French. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I did not. Perhaps we have a poltergeist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get him out of there! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that once you were a peaceful people with a richspiritual life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed you have. And more. This might prove to be an advantageto us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How about Jean-Luc? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No apologies are necessary. You reminded us that there areobligations that go beyond duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker has dramaticallydemonstrated to this court that Lieutenant Commander Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. Because it is not relevant. We too are machines,just machines of a different type. Commander Rikerhas also reminded us that Lieutenant Commander Data was created by ahuman. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant. Children arecreated from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are theyproperty? I call Lieutenant Commander Data to the stand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Show me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've been ordered to learn all we can about them. Do you knowa better way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our orders are to penetrate the Celtris Three installation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I am your friend. I canonly imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know I'mhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like that. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's how it felt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With the Gatherer truce in effect, it certainly should be. Wewon't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extendshore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It means almost certain death for you, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about his file, Lieutenant Yar? Could he have accomplishedthe reprogramming that Data says took place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, where are they now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How could they have found out about the rendezvous, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll never get away with this. Starfleet will never stand andwatch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that should not have happened. Captain's log, supplemental. As happened with oursister ship, the Enterprise is being to experience a series of systemfailures. So far they are random, but I fear they could be earlysymptoms of what happened to the Yamato. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If an automated message system is still functioning, therecould be other systems on that planet that are still operational. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. Therewere loose threads, untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. Butwhen I pulled on one of those threads it unraveled the tapestry of mylife. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're using a Code Forty Seven. I have to know what this isall about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. But don't worry. As soon as they realise ourcommunicators are not working, the sensors will find us and Geordi willbeam us up. Now, just you hold on. I'm sorry about this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a better choice. Lay in a course for the soliton wave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Roots? What, these? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ultimately, it is her decision to make, not ours. Mister Data,proceed with the mission as planned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I look forward to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Walker! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want of us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problemto worry about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. This mission can't be delayed. If you want topostpone the work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. He's missing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. TheEnterprise will be leaving this sector immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Please, Mister Worf. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, I wanted to see how you were and have a look at yourbaby! My goodness. How old is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll tell you why not. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Perrin? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, then I hope to see you tonight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you correct the problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Then you can offer no reason why they are set on thisprovocative course? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any readings of matter there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have many enemies? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you find anything that might suggest why you're apparentlythe only one among us unaffected by this, this phenomenon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From the moment they agreed to give them the felicium, my handswere tied. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll inform you of my decision shortly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not his mother. Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Never had the time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It could have been damaged by the explosion. They may have beenable to maintain orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, are you ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Commander, do you have anysuggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the shiponce we reach the Pelloris Field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identify yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand down Red alert, but keep tracking their movement,Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, maybe you should consider letting her go ahead with this genetronic procedure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q would never bother with contracts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, remove the forcefield. If you are human, which Iseriously doubt, you will have to work hard to earn our trust. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians atStarfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era. Oh,Professor.

 <bos> PICARD: That analogy is not exactly <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelledthere. No, the Iconians were certainly real. Sit down. We know thatthree systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities. Similarities which could only be explained by there being a singleunifying influence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise that it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselvesquestions regarding the future. Go on, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, see if there's any way we can do to cut throughthe interference and beam them out of there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly, Mister Worf. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bok! Where is Bok? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're certain this is Vulcan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting there was a Romulan accomplice in closeproximity to La Forge when he was receiving the signals? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report to the Phaser Range, please <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're okay too. But <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to away team. We're standingby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, for God's sake, Walker. This is a secured channel <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A few hours. If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact youimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you were emotionally affected by the music. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this what he's looking for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already startedto make rapid progress. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief. I wanted to talk to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have returned in order to give me this message? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where else would I be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any response from Aldea, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge officers. We're approaching the Devidiasystem. Report to your stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not possible. We're expected at Pacifica, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any progress, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When can you correct the problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Because Lore tells you so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform DoctorCrusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had the very same tour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in thestructural alloys which allows us to trace our material. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Who is this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot permit that. The boy is my responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal thisrupture? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander K'Nera, this is Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it was strong, whatever it was. Are you ready, NumberOne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is something to be said for a more scientific approach. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister La Forge. What kind of place is this, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Is there nothing you can do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, well, he's evidently done more than hold together. He'sthe indispensable man. The Federation's finest specialist incommunication with unknown life forms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: what is it you want, Q? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can find away of getting him to ourSickbay by fixing our computer <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What things? What people? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please inform the Academy, Mister Worf, and send my regards toSuperintendant Brand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jared, you've described quite thoroughlythe history of your people before and after Ardra's first visit. But Iam a little unclear about the change itself. Did Ardra simply snap herfingers and transform the planet into this paradise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievementfor his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans areincalculable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can you speculate as to the purpose of thesereassignments? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember. There were no survivors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Won't the moon disintegrate prior to impact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. We don't have enough information about this phenomenonto act in a responsible way. I think we'll hold off on ProfessorMoriarty's request for now, but continue with your investigation. Inthe meantime, I have to deal with ProfessorMoriarty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope their scout ship makes contact soon. It's not a goodidea to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making yourintentions known. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, as you are unaffected by hyperonic radiation, I'dlike you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft and commence evacuationprocedures. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, put us right in their path and come to a full stop. Fullpower to shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst forthe formation of a temporal rift. History has no record of your battlewith the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's the groundskeeper. One of the wisest men I ever knew. Oh,I envy you, Wesley Crusher. You're just at the beginning of theadventure. Go on. Get the water. Stay alive. They'll find you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the rest of the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well of course, Lieutenant. Choose whomever you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Well, where the hell are we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because, because you've lost the capacity for self-judgment. Now, alcohol does this, Wesley. But this contaminant we've brought backfrom the Tsiolkovsky does it even more so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I haven't talked to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Nowwho gave you that order? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, let's go and welcome the Admiral aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Mister Worf, but Starfleetbelieves that the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's no pain. It would appear I don't have any broken ribsafter all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know better than to try and movetrilithium resin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, Robert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was to have been my question of you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does this have something to do with the Klingons you rescuedfrom Carraya Four? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What were the readings for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report to detention cell three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, this may be a long shot, but we should check each oneof these seventeen people to see if they have the correct proteinconfigurations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wonder what they talked about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data, I can see it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough. Let's talk to Riva. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, who do you think you're working for? Starfleet isnot an organisation that ignores its own regulations when they becomeinconvenient. Whether you like it or not, Data does have rights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I activate the viewer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold present course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now that you have had a taste of captivity, perhaps youwill reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others. In anyevent, we now know about your race and we know how to imprison you. Bear that in mind. Now get off my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it? How so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to stay as close to the crew aspossible. Some of them may feel uncomfortable with Cardassians onboard. I don't want any incidents. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The other colony? Captain's log, supplemental. A review of stellarcharts has revealed a Class M planet only half a light year from theBringloid system. I am proceeding on the premise that it was thedestination of the colony which possessed the more sophisticatedequipment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Troi. Troi, we must talk. I believe it's possible tooutmanoeuvre this creature, and beam you and Ben back up to the ship. We've been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle. Whenthe creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security AlertPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did they want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Shelby, what is the status of out defencepreparations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I won't keep you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy. Someone with a reason for confining us here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your colony was attacked by a warship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it worked. They believed they wereoff the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What went wrong? You know, don't you? What did you do? Whathappened? Why did you leave the ship? Don't turn away. Look at me. Picard! Look at me! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, we're ready in the guest quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What could the ringing symbolise? A bell? Sound? Anold-fashioned way of communicating? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, Picard. Contact the Repulse using subspacecaptain's priority channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space. Let's see what they've stored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Estimated time of arrival, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even my sensory perception picked that up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're your brothers, your sons, and you turned your backs onthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What wereyou saying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your recommendations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is the energy being used. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry about this Gu, Gloria. I didn't actually mean you toget involved. She knows nothing about this, Johnny. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Mendak, I will take whatever action is necessary toobtain the return of the Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Moriarty, you were conjured up to attemptto defeat Holmes here. Once that attempt is concluded, win or lose,yourprogramme has run its course. Your existence is done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something has seized their ship too. They're in the samepredicament as us. Launch a sensor probe. Set it to searchfor the source of whatever this something is that is holding bothships. Go back to hailingfrequency, fast. And I regret, DaiMon Tarr, that I can no longernegotiate unless it isconducted visually. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Well, almost nothing in my position of ship's Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue phaser fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independentreading. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of what, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't you tell me what to do! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We desire face-to-face negotiation to settle the crisis on TauCygna Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley? It's good to have you back again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not until we reach the Pacifica conference, three days fromnow. Doctor, have you prepared a Sickbay facility toaccommodate our guests? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've opened the hearing to spectators? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's really quite intriguing. The whole thing is made possibleby a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion. But that's only the foundation. The modeling itself is done bygravimetric wave input. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is notfor you to set the standards by which we should be judged. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is our intent to prevent any external power from interferingin Klingon affairs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doesn't love always begin that way? With the illusion beingmore real than the woman? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what regard? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is an order, Doctor. Now, assemble all personnel on thetransporter pad. Now! Picard to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point ofthis mission were, why I was analysing these relics. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are her requests unusual? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may be on a road that has no turns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, make sure that booby trap doesn't bother anyoneagain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. How is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't denying that it may be necessary to fire on it. But Ilook on that as a last resort. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, escort Commander Riker from the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're sure, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Graves, listen to me. No one can deny the significance of yourtransformation. But I don't believe that this was part of your plan. Encountering Data was mere coincidence. One that offered you more thanyou could have dreamed. But something has gone wrong. Look here. Graves, this experiment must be terminated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Send it through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am sorry we couldn't save your ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth justto drop by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I understand from Mister La Forge there's a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I believe that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Re-engage now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, they could fire until their lasers ran dry and theywouldn't hurt the Enterprise. My predicament is what to do with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Clearly, we still possess certain skills. It would seem we knowhow to operate this ship. But our identities have somehow been erasedor suppressed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, pick up Whalen. Take him to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was his father a traitor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a photon torpedo. Fire at the enemy vesselwhen ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want alook around? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about Geordi and Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're not thinking about leaving? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Mister Worf, I thought our meetingwas scheduled for eleven hundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Walker, what is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to check the status of the warp core. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two, one <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, control your emotions. Please, open hailingfrequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And, Mister Worf? I hope you find what you're looking for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing will not beenough. We'll run out of water. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three. Lock onto the science team and beamthem aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A product for which you have no use, but which the Ornaranscan't live without. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Away team, now. What is happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm fine, Doctor. Save your ministrations for your patient. Iwant a staff meeting in five minutes. Doctor, I assume you will want toremain here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. I'm coming down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. I'll try. But I want you to know this is mutiny. Now, Number One, look at that control panel. Now, the yellow controlpad, hit that once. Now the one below it, hit twice. Now that shouldrelease the panel underneath. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quomodo tua Latinitas est? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was cold and dark because I was outdoors at night. I was ina narrow place. I was walking through an alley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, would it possible to saturate the asteroid withverteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and preventthe Romulans from detecting it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may have done too much to help them already, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you investigate the possibility of complyingwith Professor Moriarty's request. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Request an explanation of your actions, DaiMon Goss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what is her heading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'adlo. I have been pleased to offer occasional assistance tothe Klingon people in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some kind of coercive device? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. You have the Bridge, NumberOne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set phasers on stun. Number One, good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have the necessary tools to realign the coil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I should go. And you have an appointment tomorrow morningearly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? Status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lower your weapons or Bok is dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It takes very special people to live in such desolation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I am more concerned with protecting the honour andintegrity of Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop, and hold this position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse power, full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She didn't. The files were deleted, by your mother, almostthirty years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's just choose one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But that's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're quite a distance from either of theirterritories. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe we should be getting back to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, stop! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, one of the Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. Ineed you to keep them on a tight leash. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get him up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Situation, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Poorly timed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. Counsellor, I very much appreciate your concern forme, but I can assure you it is quite misplaced. I have carefullyconsidered the implications of having a Borg on thisship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced that we aredoing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable with my decision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And assemble the bridge staff for a mission briefing in fifteenminutes. Picard out. Mister Elbrun. Would you <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They know that the Ornarans no longer have the plague. Theyknow that felicium is no longer a medicine. So, of course, they arewilling to give this shipment because they don't want to take thechance that the Ornarans will lose their addiction. They don't want tolose their only customers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who might havebeen in cargo bay four today. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. These are frightening things that are happening. Butwe won't let anyone harm you. Counsellor, why don't you take the boy tomy quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tholl, our captors have transporters, they have stun beams. Itis hardly likely that they would try to hold us at bay with a knife. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that much was obvious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have an away team on board the ship. The initial reportindicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it wasfrom an attack. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps what we most needed was a kick in ourcomplacency, to prepare us ready for what lies ahead. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Abort auto-destruct sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, do you see any survivors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, your former Commander, a Federation Captain, isabout to place me in the position of firing on his ship. I need yourknowledge of the man. How he thinks, what he's capable of doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't see that you have to lose anything just by adding aconvenience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will not be necessary, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you found out about Uhnari? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But that, too, would be interference. You must progress in yourown way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They beamed aboard as a diversion to give their ship time toescape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, what place are you trying to reach? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Space-time to normal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Arboretum. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain position! Mister La <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, under the circumstances, I think it would be prudent if Iwere to make myself less available for the duration of this journey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A toast. To the young couple and their families. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems, DoctorPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do youreveal yourselves to us now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the away team? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Please. And feel free to examine the work of the otherstudents too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You want Federation involvement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineeringimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard, class of twenty seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, notify Security to prepare a detention cell. Bridge to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Options? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long can you maintain it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue the hail, Mister Worf. Priority one message. Do youknow what that ship might be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Surely Sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Discussion is irrelevant. There are no terms. You will disarm all your weapons and escort us to Sector zero zero onewhere we will begin assimilating your culture and technology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what's the cause of my headache? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The code, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you have something to say, I'm listening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when I tell you, pull up hard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's a, the doll's my cousin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until he does something more menacing, I see no reason why weshould prevent him from continuing his work. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who will one day be a man and, to extend the metaphor, willneed a fine edge that won't dull at the first touch of resistance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know you will, Captain. Lieutenant Yar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My understanding is that such devices were impractical. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much time do we have, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. We'll go see Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Processing centre? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that's it? No other comment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course you know that is out of the question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put youinto an escape pod and return you back across the border. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. My staff will give you their full cooperation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, it is a strength. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you may have brought it aboard this ship. Was there amedical scan when they transported? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It'll be some time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand from Doctor Crusher that Worf will never regain the use of his legs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The other reason being? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you access it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what's their condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Both. I think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certainelements of Klingon psyche. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative ofthe Federation, I require an explanation. Why has this child been heldin your custody for so many years? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why have you fired on us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I apologise for interrupting yourcelebration, but I'm going to need an away team. Could you report tothe Bridge, please? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I have to study upon Regalian law. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it's your decision, Chancellor. But I must say, I regretthat I won't have the opportunity of knowing your people better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're threatening to attack the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a human that has the answers to a lot of questions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect theEdo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, where exactly is the location? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aaron! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. This way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happened to her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I said we would, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inform them the transfer will take place shortly. Picard out. Mister Data, to the Bridge please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was alone down there for a long time. I'm hesitant to lethim go back until he's been evaluated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you done to Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In ways that I cannot even begin to calculate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still no response from the Klingons, MisterWorf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker is the only one who cantell us. Beam him directly here onto the Bridge <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin launch sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased. We will report as soon as our mission isaccomplished. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to that communications array. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut it off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe they did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know how to communicate this, or even if it ispossible, but the question of justice has concerned me greatly oflately. And I say to any creature who may be listening, there can be nojustice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercisein exceptions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not quite what I meant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Those are some fairly aggressive computations, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: 'Audet Nine, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: yes. Absolutely. That's why we're out here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have takenus to the brink of war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope I'm not interrupting. I was just coming off duty and Iwanted to see how you were doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then her safety must be very important to you. Give us time todetermine what is going on happened here. That way we can minimise therisks in bringing her to you. You wouldn't want to lose her because weacted too quickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have a few hours. I told you, this cell is alreadybeginning to degenerate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's the best. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There have been nine hundred and forty seven knownarchaeological excavations conducted on the planet's surface. Of those,some seventy four are generally believed to have revealed findings ofmajor importance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Comfortable? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell Data and La Forge to do themselves a favour, and stay outof their way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know everything I do, Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seen from far, far above. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That question is irrelevant here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, initiate pursuit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So we make an exception in the deaths of millions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something funny? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to capture it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation betweenthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because ship captains control their own vessels, young man! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe accessthrough this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to investigate those eleven planetsthat the Ullians visited. See if there were any reports of unexplainedcomas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. Wesley, that's not true. You're a fine young man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must take care that while he is with us,Commander Kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due thefirst officer of this ship. If he should feel patronised in any way <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan. Certainlynot for Spock who is half-human. Years spent in conflict. And now thechance to resolve all of those differences is gone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We might be able to deliver it to the same destination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quickly, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the source of this energy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trouble, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, please report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If it is a design flaw, we're better to stay where we are andgive Geordi time to work on it. Or what happened to the Yamato couldhappen to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Laren, what's going on? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I think that falls into this category. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well,thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't really take myselfseriously like this. Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, arethey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought twice was pushing it a little. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour intodogma. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That kind of control is an illusion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin long-range scanningof all sectors within threelight years of Braslota. Howis your crew shaping up? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open the lower band frequencies most commonly usedin the last century. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acamarians? Then that would suggest the Gatherers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Biogenic weapons, for example. You could provide them withintelligence that would show that the Cardassians are, in fact,supplying their colonists with them. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Change course to intercept. I'm on my way. I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Against your keeping out of humanity's path for ever. Done? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what's happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Last time I was in this sector, I was on the Stargazer, runningat warp speed ahead of a Cardassian warship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't even know what it means. The Horga'hn is for a friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What would you have me do? March down there and destroy theman? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, will you note in our report that if the governmentof Angosia survives the night, we will offer them Federation assistancein their efforts to reprogram their veterans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You want to repair them, you'll have to learn to do ityourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll have to check the craft for something to protect ourheads and eyes. And Captain, please recover your medical supplies, foodand water rations <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't there something else you have to do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try and raise her, Mister Crusher. Tell them we're only minutesaway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, how desperate is the colony'ssituation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Mrs. Carmichael Right there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep a close watch on it. So close to the Neutral Zone it can'tbe random. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I, er <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Is someone ill? Or would you rather tell her about this,Wes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? At our first meeting you seized my vessel. You condemnedall humans as savages, and on that charge you tried us in a post-atomictwenty first century court of horrors, where you attacked my people. You again seized my vessel. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them ifthey have any wounded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very strange, Number One. Like going back to the house you grewup in, but no one's home, except the phantoms of the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've arranged a demonstration to illustrate. Mister La Forge,I think it's about time, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you both. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will not be easy, but with Admiral Necheyev's support, Ithink they will go along with it in the end. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The security of the Enterprise is of paramount importance,Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are at a desperate impasse in the Peliar system. The attackon the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How interesting. So are we. Perhaps we could combine ourefforts and share our findings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Stop this foolishness, Q. Return meto the Enterprise. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The power cell is ready. We should take itover to the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle ofnon interference. As Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath touphold that principle whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I mustrefuse your request. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They brought a lot of technology. Where is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm notgoing to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister LaForge, do you have any ideas? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have reason to believe that my presence on this mission isimperative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Moving? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you waken him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Miss Odell, I <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, have you been able toestablish a lock? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, keep at it. I have to tell him that we are making someprogress. Mister La Forge. Do you have any idea how Moriarty could havegained control of the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, I think you will find Marouk's proposal <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, I realise we have acquired your complete supply ofhytritium. Do you know where we could obtain some more? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know Captain Rice? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by anothercaptive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain this course, Ensign. Three quarters impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, you will continue with your analysis and determine thedanger, not only to our ship, but the Klingon vessel also. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume the Vorgons have proof to back up their claim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. If you will accompany us to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I like climbing. There's something about actually having yourfate in your own hands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assemble a minimal away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams, but in this case,bad dreams would be more helpful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A Romulan device. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can see your quarters now, if you like. Will you show theMillers to their accommodations, please, and I shall join you later. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought of asking for a volunteer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, what got us here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we stop it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. You will respond to my questions. This isgoing nowhere. Doctor, I want an autopsy performed on the other one. Compare the differences with what we learned of Hugh's anatomy. See ifthere have been any recent modifications which might explain thesebehavioural differences. Data, run a biospectral analysis on this Borg. See if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight. That's a sudden yearning for that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Welcome to the Bridge. Please, sit down. How isCounsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, right now we have more immediate concerns. Does your mapshow us a way out of here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what brings you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inform him we're on our way. Thank you forbreakfast. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Think of giving him some of yourstrength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign, as soon as Mister Data is finished takeus to Ligos at warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man. Temporarily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, there's a reference in Captain Varley's personallog to a probe that scanned the Yamato. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought you deserved that much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A great poet once said, 'all spirits are enslaved that servethings evil'. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tactical analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, gentlemen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'd be happy to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to intercept the Romulan vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but what does it all mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We haven't found a way to transport you back yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The beast at Tanagra. Uzani, his army. Shaka when the wallsfell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I, er, I hope we can be friends? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If your theory is accurate, Doctor, what would happen if wewere to inflict pain on the others? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And so there is no evidence that a weapon was used? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have notbeen affected either. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity,apparently, has no bearing on the phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Mister La Forge, begin work on that homing device. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you couldn't. You were left alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll try and keep them occupied until you arrive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keeping me a prisoner here will not compel me to discussanything with you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you locate the shuttle? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, putting that on one side for the moment, let's assumethat by some unexplained phenomenon, you witnessed an event thatoccurred to Lieutenant Kwan. Those faces that you saw. Did yourecognise any of them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way. This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place,the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehowintermixed. What we think <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cause? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've already checked those possibilities. The initial findingswould seen to indicate that there was a radiation surge from theRomulan engine core which disrupted the signal. They neverrematerialised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am only here to secure the release of the Federationhostages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acting Captain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous childplaying on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew everycontrol, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on theBridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, Iwas convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've neverquestioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of everyStarfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, orhistorical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle uponwhich Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to standup and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wearthat uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place,or I will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, I am singularly impressed by your concern for alife. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picardout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing more? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you're here to learn about the human condition and thereis no better way of doing that than by embracing Shakespeare. But youmust discover it through your own performance, not by imitating others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interesting? You could say that, since he tried to have mekilled, and conspired to strip Worf of his good name. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's all right, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, get out of there! Beverly! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. What can I do for you, MisterBender? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, you can do that, but you haven't. I suspect you shook thisship in order toget my attention. Well now you have it. What is it you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, seal off deck eight, corridors Aand B. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a Starfleet tradition that atsocial gatherings, disputes are not permitted. I hereby declaretherefore all disagreements resolved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I feel I must postpone action until welearn more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, I don't have to remind you of the psychological impactof being a hostage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then he's still in Cardassian space? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why angry? Why were you angry at me, Wesley? Were you angry atme because I was the one who told you your father was dead? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you know his whereabouts now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We shouldstay on this course until we have reason to change it. But in themeantime, I think we should do what we can to avoid a collision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire at will. Continue rotating shield frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it certainly hasn't been abandoned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've spoken to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a fullinquiry once we reach Starbase two four seven, and that will probablylead to a general court martial of Admiral Pressman and several othersat Starfleet Intelligence. Your involvement in this affair is going tobe thoroughly investigated, Will. There'll be some hard questions foryou to answer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: See if the corridor is empty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Irrelevant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would a delay of one hour affect your plans? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There isn't a piano. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where's Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which your world furnishes you in plenty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is alot of equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it tocontact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now you propose to dismantle him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full sensors aft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Satok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is Data now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka'stemple. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't even know what I want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you are telling me there are noexplanations for these malfunctions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to hearyou talk about your career. I'm sure you would have some fascinatinginsights into the events of your time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the surface. Counsellor, any thoughts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a possibility the wound could be self-inflicted? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lifesigns? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Captain's log, perhaps? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sensor scans, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You copy, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transfer injector control to manual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you understood one word that we've said? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker! Thank God. We're leaving. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, it's not too late. If you remove thefibres, then Geordi might yet recover. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thought? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have been at peace for many years. Let us not rush headlonginto war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable, K'mpec. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How bad is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, how were the Argus reactors shutdown? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why isn't the anomaly being affected? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's alone. For the first time he's being forced to cope withhis environment without the resources of the Collective. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle to be thrownback in time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, take the Enterprise and investigate theproblem. Ensign Crusher and I will proceed to Pentarus Five. The miners have sent a shuttle. We shall leave in ten minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. Thedoor was open. I hope you don't mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I don't understand. What has happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For me as well, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff Officer, Radue. StarfleetRegulation six point five seven requires that at least two StaffOfficers are present during any treaty or contract negotiations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, report to my Ready room. My guest is departing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp five. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to see my father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amanda's question deserves an answer, Q. You've made yourselfjudge, jury, and if necessary executioner. By what right have youappointed yourself to this position? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let's move on to another survey region. Have stellarcartography begin a <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection. There are many life forms possessed of megastrength. These issues are not relevant to this hearing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you make contact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he is right. We are in their solar system. Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. Oh, and will you bring thescan analysis to my quarters when you're off watch? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you counter the effect? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, they can't. However, the claim 'I was only followingorders' has been used to justify too many tragedies in our history. Starfleet doesn't want officers who will blindly follow orders withoutanalysing the situation. Your actions were appropriate for thecircumstances, and I have noted that in your record. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But that does not mean identical, however. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Under the circumstances, I thought that it would help if Ilearned more about you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorouslibidos. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are able to make that determination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm told that your father is also dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That does not alter the fact that my orders are to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standing by, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold him steady. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean degenerative? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the rest of us may lose consciousness. If we do,it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible they could have been feeding you disinformation? You said that you had been censured. Reassigned, four months ago. Theyknew of your dissatisfaction. Could all this have been to test yourloyalty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Too close, Number One. Brinksmanship is a dangerous game. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Except it's illegal. It's in violation of an agreement that theFederation signed in good faith. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't you see, Riker? He's nothing but a flim-flam man! He'sbeen that ever since we first met him at Farpoint. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago andwhatever's going on now? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pressman? Yes, of course. You were Will's first commandingofficer, on the Pegasus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, not too bad, all things considered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at theAcademy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelledfor what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on boardthis ship. You're dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your lawyer has been dead for centuries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're not intruding. We're just finished. Come in. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there are points in the negotiations that Briam still hasto address. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Afraid of what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets,which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If Iwere to tell them any of this, I would violate that Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we suffered the same fate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't know what the enemy needed, Doctor. Love? Fear? Hope? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare to increase to warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn you!  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what youare? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identifying marks, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could they be naturally occurring? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what I have to find out. You're a man obsessed with whatyou do. Who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going? Kill,perhaps? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You still have no theory as to what's causing it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I'm Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we've learned the Q do not admire us. The Q has muddledyour mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may indeed. Those comm. panels are for official shipbusiness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, it's clear you're in pain. You can't get throughthe next hours without help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory,the sense of individuality which he has gained here might betransmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of theBorg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling ofsingularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious programme of all. Theknowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that briefmoment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whereas you, of course, have a nobler purpose in mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dream not of today. The night blessing of the Yash-El. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the unknown can be benign or malevolent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reset them, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you backout now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We'recommitted to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carryout your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for havinglied to me about this operation. I would certainly have youcourt-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Advise Mister Conor, Number One, and brief the appropriateofficers. Prepare them for transport as soon as Mister Conor approves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase to warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time thatshe was changing into a reptilian lifeform. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not allow my people to entertain you until you do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seriously, how do you plan to accelerate the buildup on theunderside of the mantle without increasing the stress on the tectonicplates? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker has told me how supportive you were inEngineering. Well done. At ease. Sit here in Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he wouldn't have died alone and afraid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there'll be no atmospheric condensers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make itso. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your returnfrom the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think we're interested. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry, Number One. I didn't mean to interrupt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can disconnect him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, stay with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet, you see we are doing everything in our power toreach the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makesus special? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The profit, DaiMon Tarr, of saving all our lives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. Go to three quarters impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, your ship was adrift, your communications inoperative. We were attempting to assess your status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't do that. If we send that ship back with new technologywe will be altering the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pursuant to paragraph one thousand two hundred and ninety, Ihereby formally request third party arbitration of our dispute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis. Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are these? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which no doubt you sold for a very impressive profit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I've just spoken with Starfleet. The Hera is missing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Chief, and well done. That'll be all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The side effects of the transport? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you can at least help us locate our people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He cried. I saw that. I couldn't believe it. A Vulcan moved totears by music? It's <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long will we be on impulse power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to bridge. Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good, Wesley. Now <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you are going to refuse his offer, you must not allowyourself to use this power again. It's too great a temptation for us atour present stage of development. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Curious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, ready phasers. Minimum power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi. What was that? Over to the left. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, can you improve our reception? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Madeline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something about your location is interfering withcommunication. We are working on the problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I mean no disrespect, but we are faced with an alarmingsituation <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will comply when I have determined the cause of thedestruction of the Yamato, and when I am fully satisfied that you werenot responsible. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Well done. And well done all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on with your briefing, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, one does not always have the luxury <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not working. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We managed to programme the holodeck inside the holodeck, anduse the same ruse that Moriarty used on us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot allow Maxwell to ambush that supply ship. Mister Worf,now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying there was some conscious mind at work here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's because <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, how long will it take us to search this system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you and Mister Data report to the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you abetter understanding of love? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Number One, have you been monitoring communications? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interesting choices. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will not arrive in your star system for at least threeweeks. That will give us plenty of time to discuss this further. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has indeed, Commander. And believe me, it's good to beback. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Kriosians have authorised me to make several compromisesfavourable to your position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. Butdespite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager torenew ties. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, I've been smuggling artefacts from Federation sites foryears. You can't help developing a familiarity with certain Starfleetpersonnel. If we hadn't have captured him, he'd probably have ended upbefore a court martial. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, he gave me quite a game for his first time out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seemsreasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's asking for your help because you're his friend. That means that you're going to have to make your decision based on that friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but there's a certain expectancy too. A hopefulness aboutthe future. You see, Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past andthe future. Hope and despair. Data, what is this? Is this part of yourprogramme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But whatever circumstances you encountered, why didn't younotify Starfleet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The flow regulator is frozen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we talk to him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fascinating. So many questions. How can a two-dimensionalentity have access to a three-dimensional universe? And are they awareof us? Number One, if we can put off the T'lli Betans, I would like toinvestigate this further as soon as we're free of the graviton field. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. I'm afraid there will be no autopsy. The family hasalready been contacted. They insist that the body must not be toucheduntil they perform the Ferengi death ritual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why did you choose to study the concepts of authority andleadership? 4 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's going to take some getting used to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of disturbance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything is possible. So you came back to Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you say that, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand ready at warp six, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Broccoli? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is close enough, Ensign. Hold this position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the Tamarian ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently, not when to duck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the IrumodicSyndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's notthat. And I'm not daydreaming either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Patch me into the navigational control of the runabout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into theUniversal Translator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's true, I don't fully understand Talarians. But you are notTalarian. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, this is fascinating. Don't you agree, Mrs. Troi? Commander, if your duties permit, why don't you join us for dessert? I'm sure that Mrs. Troi would much appreciate the pleasure of yourcompany. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know which transporter was used? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, acknowledge! Fire torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, this is as far as I can go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They reverted to a simpler existence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've arrived safely, Number One, but sofar we've been ignored. I'll keep you informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None of the scans show any anomalies. No signs of an intruder. Wesley's experiment clearly did not have the scope to affect an entirestarship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Preparation is irrelevant. Your people will beassimilated as easily as Picard has been. Your attempt at a delay willnot be successful, Number One. We will proceed to Earth, and if youattempt to intervene, we will destroy you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You cannot confine her against her will. Not on board thisship, Ambassador. She is requesting some freedom of movement and Iintend to give it to her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Audio on. You have a burn-out in your guidance system, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You missed Gul Evek by a matter of hours. I asked him to stay. I thought that an Admiral's assurances might convince him that we aretrying to deal with this Maquis situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Point taken. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The coils stay here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And then, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's odd. There's a seven year gap. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may call me whatever you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There must be one of any number of people could coordinatetheir deployment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. Headmitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now itoccurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to savehumanity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the dust? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How will you keep us a secret when so many have seen and heardso much? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Donald, that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeologicalcuriosity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume heading to Pacifica, warp factor eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Vash. Would you have brought me here if I had toldyou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Pleaseproceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Karnas could have worked for peace during those years insteadof continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Overtake, warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may not have five hours and twenty minutes. I'm aware ofthat. How can we slow them down? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, inform the engine room we need more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Patience is a human virtue, one which I am glad to see you'vetaken to heart. But doesn't this situation require a more Klingonresponse? Your discommendation is a facade to protect less honourablemen. It is a lie. Lies must be challenged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believeyou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Forge, everything's alright. We'veneutralised it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you also know that Worf's life is at stake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral. There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think our lives just became a lot more complicated. Get himoff my Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You could always resign your commission. Stay here with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take it back, Number One, and this timenothing is going to lure us away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a stupid mistake. The Nausicaan didn't take kindly tolosing. Nor his friends. They were outraged. They wanted a fight. Igave them one. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Med Alert. Medical emergency. Doctor Crusher to the observationlounge at once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse. If I can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency,I should be able to take it out with one shot. Firing. Their shieldsare down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the sperm whale on Earth devours millions of cuttlefishas it roams the oceans. It is not evil. It is feeding. The same may betrue of the Crystalline Entity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then take us out of orbit, Number One. Set a course forRachelis, warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to see neutral representative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meanwhile, you can sit here and learn something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, there's nothing unusual about that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, would you escort our guest tothe transporter room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll stay and investigate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will that plug the hole? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Data, I have an assignment for you. One especiallysuited to your talents. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The beast? There was a creature at Tanagra? Darmok and Jalad,the beast of Tanagra. They arrived separately. They struggled togetheragainst a common foe, the beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad atTanagra. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, end programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: According to Baran's logs, we are todeliver the two pieces to the T'Karath Sanctuary on Vulcan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to speak with Ihat. Do you understand? Ihat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's right. It's on deck seven. I left it in thecorridor. And then the power went out and I got lost <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, you must release these peopleso that they can receive proper medical attention. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A life form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right nowinside Counsellor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to bedone about this very unusual situation. Discussion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set a course for the Beta Agni Two system, warpsix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Let's get on with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Neither was I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not surprising. Altarian viruses can be a nastybusiness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Punished? How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare timecharting the stars. I disappear for days at a time exploring thecountryside. My life is very much as it was. Old habits. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would appear so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If her discomfort is going to affect her judgement or herobjectivity, I need to know now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is an attitude I've found common among the best officersI've ever served with. You're not one of them yet, but you could be, ifyou work at it. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I understand that before the Jenolen crashed,it had conducted an extensive survey of the Dyson sphere. Have we beenable to access any of those records? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign, I didn'tmean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damnedcardiac replacement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, could I speak with you in my Ready room? You havethe Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation will welcome that day. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the situation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will join you in a moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a hell of a time. Whatever it is, I don't want it toaffect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest ofthe crew until we've identified the cause. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must protect the rights of my officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just follow my lead with the Ambassador. You'll be fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding. Someone mighthave mistaken this for an actual raid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understandable. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That takes care of the practical, but there's more to growingup than that. It's my belief, Number One, that you're best qualified tosupervise that. Are you willing to serve? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was in the neighbourhood. When I asked the Professor why hewent all the way to Kurl, he said, I was in the neighbourhood. Doingwhat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, yes. It's, er, it's for the children. I'm, er, ha, ha,I'm a role model. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you may wait outside. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We'llstay on this course until we have reason to change it. But let's doeverything we can to avoid the collision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Profit. This is all about profit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, yes. I never know when I'll have the opportunity toride. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it have been another hologram? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My superintendent was a Betazoid, a full telepath. When he sentfor you to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws downthere. Not permitting the Crusher boy to be executed. And by so doingdo I endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporterto maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observationwhen they're here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you account for this discrepancy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, contact the Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker tomeet us at the rendezvous point as soon as possible. Have him scan theregion for temporal anomalies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, when should the results be known? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The boy was here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One day. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Jo'Bril, listen to me. It is imperative that you turnthe shuttle. Take it out of the corona. Do you understand me? Pilot theshuttle away from the star. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what's going on here. Why are we risking our lives takingthese artefacts? Who wants them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise has been caught in temporal causality loop, andI suspect that something similar may have happened to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A mistake. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him. Where would we find him other than on the floor of the Romulan Senate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because youthink it is connected to some higher purpose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll give it serious thought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Perhaps you would agree to a more productiverelationship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort him to my ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Mirandadecided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surpriseme. She was very independent, very strong willed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are some missing pieces to this puzzle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh no, I don't want that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: File Dixon Hill, private detective. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But by your own admission, Reyga was a difficult man tounderstand. Isn't it possible that he was simply masking his feelings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It could be worse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the entity that controlled you, What were yourperceptions of him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike thetwo of you actually are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand thesethings? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind ifwe spoke with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This has been a strain on our friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are they? Identify them! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's us before we stepped into the turbolift. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pagh, we're here to assist. Do youread me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'mpec believed that it was either Duras or Gowron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Respond on the same frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Twenty dollars a day, plus expenses. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whom I've killed? What do you mean? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to assume they've also taken the Bridge. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Merde. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroy it. At any cost. When I was on the Stargazer, weconducted extensive tests using theta band carrier waves. One of thereasons I was selected for this mission is my familiarity with themethods used for generating them. Mister Worf, your presence here isobvious. Doctor, your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxinswe may find. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Must be rewarding to you to repay others for all those years ofmisery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I'm pickingup three proximity sensors around it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Katherine Pulaski? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, let me remind you we are on a mission ofexploration. Our purpose is to establish peaceful relations with thecivilisations we encounter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite right. So you should. It's all over, Q. You have nofurther business here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean, possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole, but ifit should explode near the shuttlecraft they will be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take partin that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich culturalheritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That may not be possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Plot a course. Take us out of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us to warp six as soon as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How could you? How could any of us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must know we will not allow you to dothis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic volcanicactivity. Perhaps the planet has entered an active phase. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was not informed either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire in sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A theory? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if I don't avoid the fight? What if I won't make thechanges? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He knows I'm here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Advise him that we will transport sown to thesurface immediately. Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're goingto return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase two one one. ThePhoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together. Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit youthe dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The onlyalternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back tostarbase in disgrace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Number One. I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortlyafter your arrival. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I won't insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy. But I can tell you that the Enterprise will not leave them behind. Youcan be assured of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. From this time forward,you will service us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, I strongly suspect it's some explaining you have to do now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami, you have been nothing but denigrating andabusive of Commander Riker since coming aboard this ship. Now I wouldlike some explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hear you've been promoted to supervisor of the Atlantisproject. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, that's a Benzite trait. It's been suggested that anofficer from the Enterprise might participate in the programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please. Wait. I have brought you this information because Ithink you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition. Someone whose mind is open to compromise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's your best area of study? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Archaeology Council. Welcome. Mystery. It is the mystery of Tagus Three that brings ustogether today. It is a mystery that has invited more argument, morededuction, more speculation than the best works of fiction. And ifyou'll excuse the conceit, I want to tell you about my detective story. For several years now, I have been trying to unravel the secrets ofTagus Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Theorise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you clean that up, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Say when. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage deflector shield, now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's it. Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join youthis evening. If there's room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Come in, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have my complete support. You know that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge has a thought. He believes we can phaser aslice in the field <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would be hard to forget Mister Homn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the problem, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is penetration possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a Vulcanpeace initiative? I have some difficulty in accepting that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And this is the only way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you havehere. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excitement? Spending in a damp cave? Chasing after something weshall probably never find? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No theories, no half answers. Yes or no? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I must, as a matter of fact, be getting back to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full stop, helm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to sever the contact with Drema Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will proceed with the probe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kamala, have I not done everything possible to discourage this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, once I have regained voice command, I will transport youfrom the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None that I know of, but I'll check with the Bajoran liaisonOffice. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many finally? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we do. The Vorgons are time travellers. Now that theyknow where and when the Uthat can be found, they may very well comeback and try for it again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may speak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, whoever you are, I can hear you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That being? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, manoeuvre us into tractor beamrange. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there an intelligence causing this interference? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What has happened to bring you to that conclusion? That's quitea big jump. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned,Number One, but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship,then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It has been accomplished before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Astonishing. Commander Riker, have science lab three begin aseries of gamma emission tests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that is so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's perfectly normal. Most serious riders do have their ownsaddles. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am prepared to offer an added incentive. If you win, I'lltake you to the ruins of Ligillium. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has the right to meet death awake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take evasive action. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that you should enjoy the hospitality of the ship. Mister Data here will see to your every comfort. If you will excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If any man, woman or child on this ship is harmed as a resultof your experiment, I will have your head before the highest command inthe Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology and wefind ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age. The loss ofdignity, the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master. Doyou still want to be one of us, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Ensign, set course for the Guernica system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll let my Medical Officer handle it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can find a substitute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: However intriguing that may be, we are now in the midst of anurgent journey. Once that is completed, then, perhaps Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, did you get them off? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: See if you can find out any more details, Mister Data. I'd liketo know more about that storm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that's what Troi asked me to do. But why? Ten Forward, ifyou could be more specific about our intended destination <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beyond this place there be dragons. It's even said that crewsthreatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused toturn back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've been waiting a long time for this. They're not going totake any risks. Now, take one of the artefacts and beam down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They wanted us to leave Rana and that's exactly what we'redoing. Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Forge? Other opinions? Thank you for your advice.  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're preparing to take the Brittain in tow. We'll be on ourway within the hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With whatever force necessary, terminate that beam. Fire whenready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, Wesley. Come on the Bridge. Move! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For that information you'll have to ask him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a great pity you began by abducting my Security Officer,Lutan, because I should tell you I do admire the hospitality you offerhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it's a likely hypothesis, Number One. If Commander La Forgehas located a second survivor. Lieutenant, hail the Romulan vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. ActuallyI'm looking forward to meeting this mediator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Screen off. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay calm, everyone. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,he's still alive. He can help us get away from here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: True enough. It's a gamble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Then we can continue our mission without significantinterruption. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Commander Riker and an away team will join youshortly. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Would you and Isabella like to come for a walk with me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you'd be deep in negotiations by now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Klingon exercises, actually. Lieutenant Worf teaches a class. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll see if there's any room left in the class. In the meantime,I think you should make yourself more available to Clara. Let her knowshe doesn't have to rely on Isabella when she needs someone to talk to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck thirty six. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, this is Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me, mother. Please. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And Data? Next time, see me before you see Sigmund. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, Kate knew what she was doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you adjusting to your new environment, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His Soh-chIm? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you'd like to know the Council members have beamedaboard and been assigned their quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't much timefor anything else. We kept in touch but we didn't see each other againuntil we were both posted to the Enterprise two years later. By thenour feelings for each other had changed. We've served together for sixyears. Things never went back to the way they used to be. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg, is there something you're not telling me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I suggest you find a new line of work. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, you've been very patient with Ambassador Byleth, and that'sgood. But maybe it's time to let him know that some behaviour isunacceptable to us. I think it's all right to suggest limits for theAmbassador. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Requests your presence in Sickbayimmediately, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you must have one, I'm sure we can replicate it for you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. They have the energy and drive, and the clones possess theemotional maturity and the technological knowledge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Much the same has happened in human history too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I think I do. There was a tool crate on the floor. It waslabeled Utopia Planitia. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You didn't say it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, he's lying. I'm almost sure of it. He doesn't mean whathe says. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm glad you did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. Anything I can do <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Clara. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To Will, all my love, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They will now attempt to negotiate for the safety and release oftheir people. Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I would becounselling the Captain at a time like this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think he's right, Captain. Look at the common themes playingout on the holodeck. A puzzle being put together, a foundation beinglaid, a paper doll being fashioned. They're all images of somethingbeing constructed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because those are your orders. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The paracortex is the Betazoid telepathic lobe. She communicatedwith Maques telepathically just before she fell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sometimes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That was meant as a joke, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They'll need to speak to you as well, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't have to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, what would you like? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stagein front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. Do you want me to check the personnel logs? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. LieutenantZiff. She's in Quantum mechanics. That's him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Draken Four was the freighter's destination. I ordered thefreighter destroyed because I recognised the Captain, a knownFederation spy. Now we must deliver the cargo ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Sacred Chalice of Rixx is an old clay pot with mold growinginside it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just felt something too, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, it's deeper than that. The song doesn't stops for an instant. It plays in perfect clarity from beginning to end over and over again. I don't even know what song it is. I never heard it before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't look well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Clara, would you like some clay of your own? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All right, I admit it was a catalyst. But I can honestly say thatI've been thinking about this off and on over the past two years. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't know you even came in here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand any of this. Captain, I have to go back insidemy mother's mind. It's the only way we're ever going to get anyanswers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know how much the Professor meant to you and how much you wantto find out what happened, but staring at these numbers isn't going tobring him back. The conference on Atalia Seven has been scheduled forsix months. Starfleet is relying on your mediation efforts to <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do they mistreat you there? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you understand what it would do to the colony? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My god. Could it be true? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The alien persona is getting stronger and gobbling up what isleft of the weaker ego, the Data we know. If something isn't done tostop it immediately, we will lose our Data forever. Captain's personal log. We have arrived at StarbaseSix where Miss Brianon will await transport back to Earth. I am greatlytroubled by the unusual behaviour of Commander Data and fear thatsomehow it is directly related to the experiments of Ira Graves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, sir. I'm only aware of the crew and the families on board theship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nutwhatever it is, she's got it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but in a nightmare of disjointed images and half-heardvoices. He's in another dimension, looking at us across a great chasm. And he's feeling remorse at what he has witnessed. He's afraid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was there anything else in the room? Furniture? Chairs? A door? Other people? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Roga, tell them what you want. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe we should try to access the Engineering logs from UtopiaPlanitia. We might find out more about him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We never did. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know I'm certainly tired of it. How do you think it feels tosit and listen to someone whine about themselves all the time? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps you want him to be proud of you. You carry great pride inhis accomplishments. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What have you discovered? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I suggest we adjourn. Allow us all time to think aboutwhat's been said. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother can you hear me? Please come backto me. Please. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, let me come with you to greet Tam. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, stop it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our consciousness has been trapped on this moon for twocenturies. We must escape this torture. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Switch to auxiliary control. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everything I've read suggests that he was well-adjusted andoptimistic. It just doesn't make any sense. Can I get you anything? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Worf is recovering in Sickbay. The wound was notsevere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you'd liketo admit. Maybe you should get some rest. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alternate plan? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It'll take time, Geordi. A long time. But we will reconstructyour memory. Together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm having some trouble believing in those vows as once Idid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do it, mother. Tell her how you feel. I'll be here with you. I'llhelp you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what'shappening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want tohelp you get there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes I do. It's not the Klingon way, right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I am standing nextto. Beyond that, there is very little I can be sure of. I will have towait until he regains consciousness before knowing more. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If the Captain authorises it, of course I will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. It's like he's trying to confuse us, misdirect ussomehow. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry. I don't sense them well enough. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, stop it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure, but they were calling me to the southern polarregion. I believe that's where we should look for the Essex. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not sure of yourself? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. Because it's really none of your business. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why have you removed our clothing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor, she has to know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thanks for waiting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have you ever been with a counsellor before? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened there? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's Tarmin. It's your father. Captain's log, stardate 45433.2. We have set acourse for Starbase four forty, where the Ullians will disembark andreturn home. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've been concerned about you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A person died under your command. It may happen again. If youcan't learn to release the anger and the guilt, to talk about it <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It might be that, I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violatethat. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there are eleven thousand inhabitants in this colony. Atthis range, I should be sensing something. I'm not. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I feel fine, now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm very worried about his behaviour and what I've just hearddoesn't make me feel any better. Data, you're the onlyone he's reached out to, because you rescued him. We can use yourrelationship with him to help his recovery. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's a lot to review. My mother's kept a journal since beforeshe was married. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's right. Which means from now on you can call me sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, none at all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. Would be routed through the port transducer matrix. Cometo give me more encouragement? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They had a litter today in the nursery. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the shipand the crew, but know this. I'm going to have this baby. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure the cake is fine. I've just been thinking. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Commander Data. Report to your lab at once. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please! Why not simply draw up a contract which clearly definesthe duties of each family member. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's life here. A child. An old woman. Dozens more. Hundreds. Terrified. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I make a suggestion? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not permanently, just a sabbatical. You could spend a few yearscrawling through caves and digging up artefacts, and still have enoughtime to become the youngest admiral in Starfleet history. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm still on Enterprise time. Aaron, I'm going back to the ship. I'm not going to see you again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What would you like? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because I can't tell how you're feeling this morning, but itseems to me that one night of crying can't make up for months ofdenial. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It does. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've learned a great deal in a very short time. I'm sure itwon't be long before your words do justice to your thoughts. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's a story the Doctor will tell you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain does seem detached from his emotions. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's no use, Captain. He can't answer you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know why you did it either, but I can tell you that I'veheard the same kind of story from ten different people over the lasttwo days. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're not going to wear that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What will you do now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Terrified. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where've you been? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is Captain Picard speaking, not Locutus. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps that's part of their charm, and why we find them soattractive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be theofficer's game at the Potemkin? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Always. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It all seemed so real to me. I can't believe that everything Iexperienced happened in just those few seconds. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When you begin the attempt, there will be stress, and it's onlynatural the crew's concentration will shift. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was it like that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal? Did something happen to you you don't want me to know about? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's see just how relaxed DaiMon Tog is. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Someone close at hand and yet unattainable. I can do anything foryou, Captain. Anything you could ever imagine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You can. We can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's changed? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's in it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now I know you're seeing someone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't seem to be the kind of man to give up so easily. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I came to see how you're doing. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're up to something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He is concealing something. It's more than just being too busy. Your announcement about coming down has sent him almost to a point ofpanic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mmm hmm. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well I'm sure we're just as strange to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you might be lonely. No one sees you except Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't know it was possible for a human anda Klingon to produce a child. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, have you been in my quarters? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You two have successfully divided the evening between you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unlike humanoids? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, when that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was overI realised that a part of me missed it. Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I feltlike I was exploring a whole new side of myself. Not that I want togive up counselling by any means, but I really would like to stretchmyself a little. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: God forbid I should miss my first look at thewormhole. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then I'm sure that if you remember anything that might berelevant to our investigation, you'll contact me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you suggest? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, a Counsellor has to maintain a discreet distance. I'd ratherthink of us as friends. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In a Romulan ship? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's imprinted on us. It thinks the Enterprise is its mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did he get along with his coworkers? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wait, wait. You're over-analysing, Data. One cannot deny humannature. What kind of a man is Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, continue the programme. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm feeling very dizzy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can see that. Where are you going? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I know you and he have had some problems. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most of them don't. Ilook at these faces and I wonder who they are and if they could berelated to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So far, Mother's in no danger. I hope she knows what she's doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you'reconcerned about dishonour? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain? Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people, the imagesthat music brings to your mind, and then give it a form. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're the third person today who's come to me with somethinglike this. An intense emotional response provoked by an object. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nevertheless, you are here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: For several years. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. I'd like you to talk to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Am I interrupting? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How come we're talking about me instead of you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've given me the identity of a Tal Shiar officer. Is there areal Major Rakal? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tasha! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no need to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you mind if we join you? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't you think so? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which means? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very good, Hedril. This is where people come to relax, enjoythemselves in a natural setting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was all set for another round of arguingwhen all of a sudden she just fell apart. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very impressive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've been moving from starship to starship since Clara was twoyears old. Maybe Isabella provides a constant companion. She knows thisis one friend she won't have to leave behind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our plan? What about the people on that freighter? Why did youfire? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why did you stop me? Someone needs to set her straight! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was like this for you and Jack? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I do. Only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to mymind's wishes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why not? What kind of a test is this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everyone has tempers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wouldn't you rather be alone with me? With me in your mind? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I felt her die. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think you need an empath to sense that woman's feelings. There's hostility that she seems to have transferred from Lore to Data. Perhaps you shouldn't have forced them together so soon. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand his frustration. We created himand we created her to be the woman he loves. Surely we have someresponsibility to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It may be that when Lieutenant Pierce was struck by the plasmastream, the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathicpattern into the residue. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But what I do is different. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's feeding off the energy of the Enterprise as it would fromits mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, but I do have an appointment with him in less than half anhour. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data has made first contact with CaptainPicard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His memory's intact. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe he was a friend or one of her patients. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: More so for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why, thank you, Isabella. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's hope it's enough. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is going on here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The thanks should go to N'Vek. He sacrificed himself to savethem, and me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why didn't we notice it before? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of theirspecies' intellectual capacity. They want instant knowledge, instantpower and gratification. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You want to leave. Why can't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really have to be going. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are very tall. It might be threatening to some people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Dark? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What makes you think that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Solari need you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He wished he could have been here when you got back from shoreleave. You should have seen him, Worf. He stayed up all night talkingabout how proud he was of his father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Moths fly toward a flame. Horses sometimes run into a burningbarn. Data, don't you see? We've been thinking in three dimensions. Wehave to get two-dimensional. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Its mind is much too powerful. Recommend we avoid contact. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This gives me the right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If it's the best we can do, we have to try it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It should never have happened. I knew there was concern aboutoutside influences and I should have been more careful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Only to avoid confusion, mother. Humans constantly think onething and say another. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe I should go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't listen. Think of something else. Stop! Please, stop! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you intend to do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't even think about it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, Worf. It's just an illusion. It's not real. Please, put downthe knife. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We both know Will's innocent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You could be over-preparing. You've been looking forward to theupgrade of the holodeck. You have the time. Captain, you need thediversion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When I first saw you, I felt as if I'd been waiting for you. I'mtrying to understand why or how that's possible. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh. Er, Heaven is. Well, it's, how can I put it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't be sure. The emotions of the crew are particularly strongright now. It's difficult to filter them out. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Absolutely. I only ever felt this, well, with someone who's onthis ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I suppose that's true. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All of you have been selectively bred? Your patterns chosen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, what are you doing here? You can't just stroll on to theBridge whenever you feel like it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll talk to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, after a poker game. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Concerned? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My first duty is to the ship. The ship! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do we have a choice? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not opening the door for him, Captain. I can only tell youthat I sense something very unusual about him. Something that is notinherent to a criminal personality. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A pleasure, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, search for the term Darmok in all linguistic databasesfor this sector. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm not going another step like this. A starship has itscustoms, just as we do. If you're my mother's valet, then please valet! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are your signals reaching them? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's really hard for me to separate my feelings for them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but you do know better. Androids don't feel such things. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've never felt anything like it. It was asthough they were calling to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. And you might be surprised at just how good you can be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll be glad to help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really don't think this is the place to be discussing this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. I feel it too, but don't you worry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I ask how? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To allow them to suffer? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And now they have become militant. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Poetry is an art form that uses words, put together in new andunexpected ways, sometimes in rhyme. Milton was speculating that inHeaven, roses wouldn't have thorns. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I knew you'd encourage me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well then, maybe I should slow down. Catch my breath. Not letthis get out of control. + <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I should have walked away as soon as I saw what was happening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's beautiful, but frightening at the same time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's look under the bed. Is she there? Okay, where else? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I'm here, Data. Geordi said you wanted to see us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, I think it's time you tell me about this mysteriousmarriage to a man you've never met. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He also mentioned that you said you saw something in thetransporter beam. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, God. My head's still spinning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't do this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How are we going to know whether the pulse reboots Data's ethicalprogramme? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. There were literally thousands of people involved in buildingthe Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just a moment. Yes. Yes, I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Look at what he's carrying. To Be Continued... <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: How do you do, Lal? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all right. Everything's fine, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His facelooked like that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not yet. The best thing we can do right now is to let Timothytake us where he wants to go. We should support the process and evenencourage it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If there is a cosmic plan, are we not a part of it? Our presenceat this place at this moment in time could be a part of that fate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The new night duty officer? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why'd you lock the door? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you would prefer to discuss this in private. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but I can't read youright now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just right. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Meaning what? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can imagine. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My God. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think so. I'm feeling a bit unfocused. It'll pass. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all right. Have you considered the possibility that this wasjust a dream? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. Have you ever wondered how Alexander felt about being sentaway? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself. Thiscondition could just reverse itself time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Never. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wanted to see how he was doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I have his address. When you get back to Earth, you can goand see him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: From now on I want you to ask a grown-up before you go to anyplace that is off-limits. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, don't even think it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's an interesting thought <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's more than that. I'm been sensing very erratic emotions fromher. Even the clothes she's wearing are unusual. They're so subdued. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's right. You're no match for theHollanders. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor, the Captain is quite capable of command decisions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's a very unique person, but he's not whatyou might expect, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something's very wrong, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's just say you both have well established personalities. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They seem to have made it succeed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why won't they stabilise? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I've just had some terrific news. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Naturally. I didn't know you'd ever been to Kostolain. Or was heon some diplomatic mission to Betazed? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will we? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a risk we have to take. You're the one who outlined thestakes to me, N'Vek. Are you getting squeamish now, just because thingsare getting a little more dangerous? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tasha? What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is this how you handle all of your personnel problems? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them aregenuinely unaware of what's going on. It's as though this emergentintelligence is like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figureitself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on isours through our holodeck programs. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So it was a good ceremony? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you. Thank you for making me face my other half. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're right. I don't trust you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Right now, I feel as two-dimensional as our friends out there. Inthe universe but barely aware of it. Just trying to survive oninstinct. Data, what if they're simply acting instinctively? There areinherent, inborn forces in every species. What they need, what theyfear. We have to discover what drives this species. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, that's bound to cause a dream or two. So, shall we startgoing over the personnel reports? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I don't know what to do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Disregard that order. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You must save him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everything. Every time I think about this war, our mission, Ifeel a sense of panic like a hand's closing around my throat. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Jev. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is life on board, but it's fading. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know you do. Just take that memory and put it aside for amoment, and tell meeverything you remember about the shuttlecraft trip after you left theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're part of Ambassador Spock's underground movement. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened lastnight? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not exactly. I mean, I don't know who you are, but there'ssomething about you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd love to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure I know what that means. You're happy here. Happierthan I've ever known you to be. So, it comes down to a simple question. What do you want, Will Riker? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So that when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they're surrounded bytheir fellow Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Roga, this is Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not just that. I've worked hard to make a life for myself onthe Enterprise. I'm happy here. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A friend for Worf. They're all very interesting. Do you have afavourite? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lotalike. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise ourfriendship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alkar, is there anything I can do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't remember these toys. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You'd make a good counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said you woke up a new woman thismorning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can discuss your wounded, but first you will move the ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's correct. For instance, we know that Darmok was a greathero, a hunter, and that Tanagra was an island, but that's it. Withoutthe details, there's no understanding. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, he has to get past brave. He's very angry and he has to learnhow to express that anger before he can really say goodbye to hismother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm glad you stopped by. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why can't you do that? Why can't you turn your disadvantage intoan advantage? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Betazoid blood is also practical, Captain. The odds are very goodshe'd defeat Lutan's wife easily and you would win all the bargainingpoints you need. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We did our best to prepare him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, you all remember a table, so let'sstart with that. Computer show me a table. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Pull up a chair. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant, are you aware that I can sense when someone's tellingthe truth? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The crew values Picard's life above all others. Captain Picard,we agree to your proposal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do not intend to explain myself to you. You will set a course. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm fine. There's nothing wrong. I'm just tired, that's all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Commander Riker and I are friends. Close friends, but nothingmore. Why don't we sit down? Do you remember the last time we saw eachother? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have felt no pain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are we at war with the Ferengi yet? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let me take you to Sickbay. Acting Captain's log, stardate 44642.1. I haveassumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Oursituation is deteriorating. Many of the crew are unable to function andour life support systems are beginning to falter. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, he did make a pass at me last night. A good one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it's worth a try. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my bodybut, I don't. I feel fine. Better than fine. Wonderful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long have I been here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! Stop! You're hurting me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, increase temperature by five degrees. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's very generous, Worf, but he's not a Klingon child. He hasdifferent sensibilities. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why have you brought me here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: After the past few days, I could use something a little bland. Goodbye, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're also very anxious about something. It's Will, isn't it? You're not as close to him as you'd like to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me telepathically. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All our technology and experience, our universal translator, ouryears in space, contacts with more alien cultures than I can evenremember. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Bridge. He can hear you. Captain's log, supplemental. Following an abortedattempt to take control of the Bridge, Counsellor Troi, Mister Data,and Chief O'Brien have seized Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's just something I sense in Odan. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They seem to be creatures of extremes. One moment violent beyonddescription, the next tender. They are related to the Vulcans, but aseach race developed, their differences grew wider. They are intenselycurious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. Forsome reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it isthat fascination, more than anything else, that has kept the peace. Oneother thing. They will not initiate anything. They will wait for you tocommit yourself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It sounds like my own planet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thanks for your help. Come in for a minute? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're bonding gifts. What you would call wedding presents. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why should you care whether I trust you or not? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Military? He's a soldier ? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Here. There. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't want to sleep. The music will only follow me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think she's real for you, and that is real enough for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She was an excellent Captain's wife, and a very good ship'scounsellor. She took over after I left. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How typical of the military to resort to brute force whendiscretion is required. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There are two disparate personalities within Lieutenant CommanderData. Each distinctly different. A dominant and a recessive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why is he doing this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, it's not. It's him. It's Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you notice any change in his behaviour recently? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. You said among the Cairn, nothing is hidden. We valuehonesty, but we don't always share everything we're thinking andfeeling. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jeremy, I don't know what that was, but it was not your mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain has to recite the entire greeting without making anymistakes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't have a plan anymore. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has anabnormally high need for achievement. Self image to him is a functionof what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too highcan kill to meet them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have thirty seconds to change your heading or additionalmembers of your crew will require medical attention. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long will the fields last? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do. He was at the university on Betazed when I studiedpsychology there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know you're angry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I disagree. This isn't fantasy, it's theatre. You used towithdraw onto the holodeck. You isolated yourself inside your ownimagination, avoiding contact with real people. Look at yourself now. Look at all the other people you're with. You're not just acting,you're interacting. Give yourself some credit, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. His desire for peace issincere. He wants this alliance. There is no cause for concern. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: With the vaccine? None. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do you people live like this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And yet you're telling me I'm supposed to get used to it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide witheither it could be very <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I perceived no fear or deception from him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm in for twenty. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is real Bajoran foraiga. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, we'll start weekly. And as a first step, I'd like you to shutdown your dreamprogramme until our next session, just to be on the safe side. Giveyourself a chance to reflect on this experience. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course it does, but it's not just a matter of taste. It's thewhole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around therim, leaving only ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon theice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it. Relish everybite. Make every one an event. And then, with the last spoonful, closeyour eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. Janet. Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to cancel your appointmenttoday. Actually, I'm resigning as Ship's Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll see you later, Mother. Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And I'm sure the council members will agree with you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe I can help with the Cairn. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's right, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hold position and wait. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are we children to you now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What have you done so far? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is the ship's arboretum. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which aspects are you referring to? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there anything you can do to the ship or to the cloakingdevice that would let the Enterprise track us? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So what else has your research uncovered about William Riker? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is it responding to us? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, then I have an advantage, don't I? I see her quite often. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The creature is filled with rage. Undirected, unfocused rage. When he confronts it, his guard goes down because he's feeling itinstead of suppressing it. Acknowledging his needs makes himvulnerable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sorry I'm late. I lost track of the time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wish I knew how to help, Captain, but under the circumstances <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, dispatches. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This isn't going to be easy for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has focusedits attention entirely on you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, take a look at this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't it? Maybe they've had contactwith the Fleming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tasha. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying tomake me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition,instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience. It's not that easy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Federation has neglected to visit to your planet for far toolong. With your permission, we would like to correct that oversight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: From his body language as well as his words and tone, I'd judgethat what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The first man I ever loved was my father. He was strong and tall. He carried me when the ground was muddy. He chased away the monstersthat hid under my bed at night. And he sang to me, and kept me safe. And he went away. What I wouldn't give to hear those songs again. Tofeel his arms protect me. I never will, but I can still feel his warmthand his love as though he were here with me. If you can feel thosethings from the man we know as Will Riker, accept them. Accept thelove. Captain's log, stardate 44823.8. Representatives ofthe two moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet thenew Ambassador Odan. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In two or three weeks, nanites may be all that's left of theFederation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop. Shantil Three. Computer, cross-reference the last entrywith the previous search index. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The other two are secretive, but she is as open as she appears. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If Isabella is making you do things you know are wrong, then youmust tell her it's not acceptable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very well, Lieutenant. Hot chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand. She was fine just yesterday. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. This is much more powerful. Full of anger! Hate! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Does this mean you're going to cancel the concert this evening? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ian Andrew, after my father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your metabolism's stabilising. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Doctor has something very important to tell you, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps when this planet becomes a member of the Federation,we'll be able <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Between father and son. A fair and balanced way to achieve amutual sense of order. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You will <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, but the combination wasn't possible out there. He's introuble, sir. We have to beam him back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She was eleven, maybe twelve, with blondehair. Clara. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now thanever. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: For a price. Five hundred dollars. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's the puzzle. With most life forms I can usually feelsomething. I may not be able to understand or interpret it, but I feelsomething, if only a presence. With him, nothing. Empty space. It's asthough he isn't even here. Something about this concerns me. I don'tknow what, I can't point out a reason yet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If the aliens have been killing people there, well, someone mighthave noticed something unusual. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where am I? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You told me I'd be helpful. You needed me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why that might be? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There are many ways to help a friend, and sometimes the best wayis to leave them alone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His mother's Napean, his father's human. It all looks so normal. For some reason I half expected the place to be a mess. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Could you open this door for me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not much. My human physical response must be blocking them out. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Darmok. Well, it seems to be a point of contention between them. Perhaps something the Tamarian captain proposed that the First Officerdidn't like. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't explain how it happened. I only know that it did. TheEssex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was. Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The shipwas ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness wasabsorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did the table do something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. you're making quite an effort to be cheerful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll make sure he reaches your parents' home safely. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's headed toward the caves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop. Go back. Further back. There. Stop. One moon circles. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Usually. Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship'sCounsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think Ishould go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wes, your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk toJeremy. Why is that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, it's not. Could your real mother just make all this appear? You must not stay here. Come with me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why would we be sending them power? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She wants to take you away from me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Like what? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'd like to introduce you to thewinners of the primary school science fair. This is Marissa, JayGordon, and Patterson. They're here for their tour. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Most children do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I believe not, sir. They seem mainly curious. In the case ofLutan, however, I did feel other needs. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you know of any reason why he might do that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's psychologically valid. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He needs your strength right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm still concerned, Captain. I've never seenhim act like this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. Just waking up here. Why do I feel so frightened? What happened to me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It could have prepared him for whatever is happening now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know, but this isn't a Klingon ship and Data was your friend. And it's the second time you've replaced a crewmate who's died. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've found something. I have been able tolocate a family living outside of Indianapolis. The man's name isThomas Raymond. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please, I must find you to tell you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I felt something during the concert. Vague and undefined, butvery disturbing <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Some things improve with age. Maybe your trombone playing will beone of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did Data say why he wants to see us? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, I'm picking up energy fluctuations over here. Troi toPicard. Captain, acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, this isn't right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander. Those aliens. What they feel is not helplessness. Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger, great danger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you firstrecall this sensation of memory loss. Picture it exactly as itoccurred. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Soren. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know that. I also know that he will make every effort toprotect the lives of his people. Since our demands are not excessive,Captain, I hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than torisk further injuries. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because I know how I'd feel if I was asked to replace Data at hisstation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I won't. I want to be here, with you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm afraid I'm going to lose myself. I can't get enough of him. Is it possible to fall in love in one day? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And the human heart is too small to permit that feeling now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I need a bath. You have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They haven't tried to communicate with the outside. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sunad thinks so. He feels personally threatened by John. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sela could have been cloned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not like Data to be so secretive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If there are no medical objections? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Picard, you are mine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can I share something important with you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're upset. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's convinced he's right. I have no doubt of that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't you think I'm attractive? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a great deal ofcourage to put yourself on display like that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I remember now. He came on board about six months ago. I thinkhe's in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? Who's Vigo? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Picard's empath? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What about our children? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As I told you, Captain, the ship broke up in the atmosphere, andthe bridge went down here. When we reach it, you will beam what's leftof our skeletal remains on board this ship and then take them back toEarth for a proper burial. You see how simple a request this is? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Only what you tell me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you might like some company, if you're not too busy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, I had no idea you'd thought about getting married. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How? What were you trying to do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, maybe he's just tired of hearing you complain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not getting much, Captain. A few words, disconnected phrases. I can feel his terror but I can't seem to get through to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, perhaps you over think things. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The way other people change. How they start to treat youdifferently. They walk on eggshells around you. Sometimes they avoidyou altogether. Sometimes they become overbearing, reach out a helpinghand to the blind woman. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you see anybody? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someonedoesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Abandoned. Who deserted you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's very hard to accomplish. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't you think you should tell the rest of the crew? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck thirty six. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened to all the people? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Welcome, Captain. Allow me to introduce myself. I am CaptainBryce Shumar, of the Federation Starship Essex. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something's wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do it to help my crew, not outmanoeuvre them. And I don't hidethat I'm an empath. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Seriously. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What would Jeremy do for friends in your world? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then your theory's correct. The organisms are sensitive todifferent types of endorphins. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your ship is again in our space. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm concerned about Beverly. I'vetried several times to talk to her, but she's been avoiding me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: About what? You becoming counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not from us, but certainly from them. They've attacked us inevery encounter. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Well, a loss can be disheartening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, I thought you might like apartner. This is Clara Sutter. She's new on the Enterprise. Clara, meetAlexander Rozhenko. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a child. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're not responsible for what happened to your parents,Timothy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! No, of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince meof anything. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This entire experience has been <eos>
 <bos> DATA: His upper spinal column has been broken in three places. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I thought you might want to know why I would be willingto risk your life for several small machines. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I'm reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptiveprominences, sir. The magnetic field is extremely irregular. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf has programmed our replicators to make a verygood approximation of Klingon bloodwine. I believe you will find it toyour liking. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I realise that, sir. But if he were, and he wanted to lead anaway team, you would tell him that the Captain's place is <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, is Geordi well enough to answer somequestions? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yet there are numerous examples where it was successful. Theindependence of the Mexican State from Spain, the Irish Unification of2024, and the Kensey Rebellion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By comparing the Stargazer's main computerlog with Captain Picard's personal log, I have found checksumdiscrepancies, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beam is fully restored, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminatedapproximately five hundred years ago. That would be consistent with theother artefacts we recovered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Much of his file we could not retrieved. His name is L Q SonnyClemonds. Apparently his occupation had something to do with music. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts. Itis similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assume your hand print will open the door whether you areconscious or not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am a Frenchman. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Antimatter injector online. Reducing flow capacity. Commencingwarp engine shut down, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The strain of this mission on Sarek has made it impossible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe we should leave them here,sir. With your permission, we will be returning with three containers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not, unfortunately. It means only the knowledge they hadaccumulated. Actually, I am quite deficient in some basic humaninformation. Sneezing, for example. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. However, they have left sensor frequenciesclear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Sheliak will not accept humans on their planet, And they willnot hesitate to use force to remove you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. Data to Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An intriguing experiment. The capsule might provide us withinformation without the need to decode the storage medium itself. Perhaps we should examine your theory immediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the life form is draining energy directly from the fusionreactors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is not an efficient method for the preparation ofsustenance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And do you realise, Lore, that I am obligated to report all ofthis to our ship's Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Jack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by, Captain. Mister Hobson, prepare to fire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is all right. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our current speed, four minutes thirty seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct. Key blue, amber, amber, red. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi's examination was exemplary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Undetermined. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bearing one eight seven mark four. I am unable to determine ourdestination, however we are heading away from the Mekorda sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is my understanding that the item selected should reflect thepersonality of whoever is giving it. This does not remind me of you. Have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without further reinforcement, containmentfield integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Explosion in Jefferies tube section T ninefive. All external sensors inoperative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Moriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept onlyhis commands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a high degree of probability thatthe temporal rift is symmetrical, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In reference to your most recent letter,I agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information onmy programming and operation. Therefore, in response to your request,this correspondence will include a complete record of my activitiesduring a normal day, with particular emphasis on my perceptions offriendship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The retro virus is working, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not true. I have no human feelings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: File names can be anything, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Malfunction, I trust. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Coming in now, sir. The probe is within visual range of theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The fragmentation effect continues along a heading of two sevenzero mark one five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to seewhat happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find Lieutenant Worf to be what iscalled a kindred spirit. We were both orphans rescued by Starfleetofficers. In many ways, we are both still outsiders in human society. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She was killed in the line of duty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Brechtian Cluster has two inhabited planets. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the stringfragment, rather the string's vibration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ambassador Odan, Doctor Crusher. I was just on my way to speak toyou. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Again, insufficient information, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least thirty seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Who are you? What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He enjoyed her kindness, her gentleness, her physical attributes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you had an off switch Doctor, would you not keep it secret? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise to object off our starboard bow. Request that youidentify yourself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecularpatterns themselves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To prepare, I have scanned all available literature on parenting. There seems to be much confusion on this issue. One traditionaldoctrine insists, spare the rod and spoil the child, suggesting apunitive approach. While another more liberalattitude would allow the child enormous freedom. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has engaged the Borg at Wolf three fiftynine, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The door sensor is programmed to recognise only humanoid formsforentry and egress. Spot could not have triggered the mechanism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By all means, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may bediluted, but it should still have enough potency to work. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No life signs, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can bedetrimental. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approaching Nelvana system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They would annihilate one other, causing a rupture in space. Ibelieve this is what happened in the Devron system. The rupture may besending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normalflow of time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since you seemed to know so much about Captain Picard and theship, I assumed that you would. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can enhance them through the imageprocessor in the ship's computer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, anAcademy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that at this distance we are unable to distinguishthe pod from the inorganic matter normally present in space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The use of the chime is unique, but not at all dissimilar tothe <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Presumed destroyed. The Enterprise C was last seen near theKlingon outpost Narendra Three exactly twenty two years, three monthsand four days ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our orders are to proceed to this star, Beta Stromgren. Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of analternating cycle of expansion and collapse, and will soon result in asupernova. However, the unmanned long range space probe sent byStarfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlikely, sir. Our records show that you supervised all Bandicontact with other worlds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understandingof its function. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Carlos. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not any more. He wants us to find him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then he wishes to relocate us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Geordi. I shall miss you at weapons systems analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nucleosynthesis. The structure of the glasshas been altered at the atomic level. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, they are initiating their transporter system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, may I remind you that during the Galen border conflict, itwas a common tactic of the Talarians was to abandon their observationcraft, rig them to self destruct <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And what Klingons do to their children <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Try a bypass on the shield control interface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have completed a scan of the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. E-band emissions are difficult to localise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. I have located a large concentration of nodes behindthis wall. They appear to be connected directly to the holodeck's mainpower coupling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Port thrusters firing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However it will take some time to takeeffect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An artificial environment has been constructed on the southerncontinent, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The life support systems on the ship are failing, sir. Propulsion, navigation, and all communication, inoperative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are life signs. However, sensor readings are highlydistorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Wesley, now! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The doors, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In relative terms, perhaps not. Nevertheless, it seems clear thatmy life is to end in the late nineteenth century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not sing for me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the destroyer is hailing us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanners still show nothing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictableevent. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko may nothave had sufficient warning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it will set upresonances in my positronic subprocessors. I will receive theinformation on what you would call a subconscious level. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Legends which are totally unsupported by fact, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be their next likely target. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has itsown unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Professor Moriarty, I presume. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probes ready, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Half metre to the right, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is unacceptable, sir. I have no desire to remain here andeven if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Read, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a way, Doctor. However, there is no physicality. The programmeis continuous but only within the computer's circuitry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Overlay display with tachyon emissions. Highlight any tachyonsignatures which show subspace inertial displacement. Concentrate asensor sweep in that area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoymentof sex? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It may be difficult, sir. I am detecting a significant number ofstrands behind us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, other than ourselves, I am picking up no life signs here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, I am capable of distinguishing over one hundred andfifty simultaneous compositions, but in order to analyse theaesthetics, I try to keep it to ten or less. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is what troubles me. I made no mistakes. I have conducted adiagnostic check of all of my programs. I am cross-checking with theship's computer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Definitely not a single entity if that's what you mean, sir,although they know the Edo worship them as a god thing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One hundred seventy two years, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our Betazoid Counsellor is often aware of things beyond ourperceptive abilities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are losing containment in the starboardnacelle tube. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have not yet identified the substance, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A small moon orbiting the fourth planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Children of Tama were called incomprehensible by CaptainSilvestri of the Shiku Maru. Other accounts were comparable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When he was attacked, Professor Galen began to protect certainfiles in his computer memory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weaponsof the period. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is told by nefarious lothario MickeyD, who appears only at the climax to carry out the cold-blooded murderof the hotel bellboy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The phenomenon is closing in on itself, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twelve minutes to structural failure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot make the lock, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that with each new generation they enhancetheir own design. The rate of evolution would be extraordinary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Although I do not require sustenance, I occasionally ingestsemi-organic nutrient suspension in a silicon-based liquid medium. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Will cancelling the wedding make you happy? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The barriers between quantum realties are breaking down. Otherrealties are emerging into our own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate that the shield iselectromagnetic, a complicated light refracting mechanism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry for the disruption, but he would not believe me when Itold him we were friends. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The interface unit is operating within expected parameters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You simply do not understand. In a quest such as ours, sacrificeshave to be made. It is regrettable, but the greater good must beserved. Give me your visor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is his grandmother, Captain. He was born fourteen years agoon the Federation colony, Galen Four. His parents, Connor and MoiraRossa, were killed three years, nine months later when their colony wasoverrun by Talarian forces. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The life form's patterns are stable, Captain. It seems able to withstand the solar radiation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cancel separation sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know, and that is what puzzles me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Zakdornian culture is replete with self-assuredness andconfidence. Seldom is it undeserved. For example, Kolrami is a thirdlevel grand master at the game of Strategema. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Minimum for our needs, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beingsdoes diminish proportionately with the deprivation of nutritious fuelor <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was never actually a possibility. The wormhole's small sizeand relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We know the Edo share them, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Report, please. Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My hair does not require trimming, you lunkhead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A dimensional jump can create subspacepressure modulation, Captain. By setting up a magnetosphere echogramthat can monitor each of their movements, we may be able to collectenough data to trace their power source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But Counsellor, I do not have a <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Argus reactors are shutting down. We are no longerin danger, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The children were not laughing with you, they were laughing atyou. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Very well. I have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can see we have a lot of work to do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interfaceexperiment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe that is also an attainable goal. If we utilise theentire Engineering department, there should be sufficient manpoweravailable to complete the task. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The product continues to upgrade and improve. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Federation will offer as little or as much help as youdictate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. But I do not agree with Talur's assessment. Although I dohave gaps in my memory, I know that fire is not an element. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are within visual range of the transport, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because the end result was unknown. The object could have beendangerous. It may in fact, be dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up massive triolicwave activity on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Computer, run an analysis of all known Romulantransmission formats, all bands, Identify any commonalities withdisplayed waveform. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Integrity field stress exceeding eighty twomillion kilodynes. Recommend immediate shutdown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These are the most unusual humans I have ever encountered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: DiMaggio, sir. Jolting Joe, the Yankee clipper. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing on the sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel has altered its course to a direct intercept with theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Then I will take you to the corridor. We will transport backto the Enterprise from there. Do you understand? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An ancient Earth device used primarily for transportation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be quite suitable, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, but was his modus operandi not dissimilar? Worthinvestigating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intriguing. It is possible we could've caused the very anomalywe've been looking for. Let us assume for a moment that the Captain hasbeen travelling through time. Let us also assume he has initiated antachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three timeperiods. In that case, it is possible that the convergence of threetachyon pulses could've ruptured the subspace barrier and created ananti-time reaction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. We are well within tolerance levels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, butboth are alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by. Processing. Processing. Fascinating. The Borg groupconsciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out allfunctions. Defence, communication, navigation. They are all controlledby a root command implanted into each <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I have successfully learned to dance? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nurse Ogawa has recently became pregnant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a way, it would have been like committing suicide. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you attempted an audio analysis? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Choo! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have never had a nightmare. I do not require sleep. Timothy,are you having disturbing dreams? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain, sir. The phenomenon is within visual range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, identify please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not nervous. I am confused. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf. Your clothing identifies youwith the character of Will Scarlett, just as Geordi's mandolinidentifies him as Alan A-Dale <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever thedebris is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unfortunately, yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would take too long to explain. You and your family mustleave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have identified the vessel, Captain. It is the Batris, ageneral cargo vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. It is as you see it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is indeed laid out as a vessel with what appear to becorridors and chambers. An internal environment suitable for carbonbased life forms is being maintained, yet there is no evidence of acrew aboard. Tin Man is a living being which has been bred or hasadapted itself to serve a purpose. I find that interesting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will not take long to isolate the appropriate geneticmaterial. I will need to get the Sickbay computer back on <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are more alike than unlike, my dear Captain. I have pores. Humans have pores. I have fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. Mychemical nutrients are like your blood. If you prick me, do I not leak? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. Starbase one two three has detected twoD'daridex class cruisers on an intercept course. The top speed of thisclass cruiser is known to be less than ours. Therefore we do have someadvantage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it is separate and self-contained within the body ofthe dead life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A subspace phase inverter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What are your intentions, Professor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths. Icannot allow that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no indication, Commander. I have no way to predict. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have compiled all available records pertaining toJason Vigo's criminal record, and <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir, into the standard parking orbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He claims to be a twenty second century inventor, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot see what effect my being here would have had <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Neural connections complete. I have access to the Borg subspacesignals. Processing. Processing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is our theory. We believe unauthorised access was made sixdays ago. The imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching theArray. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not privy to the exact details of when, where or how yourfirst coupling took place. I could investigate it <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary messageentered into my static memory by Captain Picard. Geordi, are weplanning to fire on the alien habitat? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ruah Four is a class-M planet. Sixty seven percent of its surfaceis covered with water. Its landmass contains multiple animal species,including a genus of proto-hominids. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unable to identify source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Recent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive thepassage of time. For example, I have often heard people comment thattime seems to pass more slowly in one instance, or more quickly inanother. In reality, the actual passage of time remains fixed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I so different from you, Doctor? Are you able to ceasethinking on command? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What choice of vocation would have met with your approval, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. It is empirical data. I believe the fragments were originallyplaced in this container to protect people from accidental exposure. The word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of themetal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I am reading a minor power drainin the starboard conduit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I require your advice. I have come to an impasse regarding myrecent unexplained experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A perfect score? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Target two, one thousand six hundred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The close pass by the weapons must have disrupted ourcommunicators. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Given the selections, I prefer four seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to saya ritual farewell to those you call friends. I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me asthough I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. Heaccepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. ButI do not know how to say goodbye. RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Target is destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an interesting hypothesis. If I ambeing affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level,it may also explain my waking dreams, and my subsequent anti-socialbehaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was an excellent choice for them, Captain. They were able tocommunicate with me quite. I was about to say quite easily, but therewas nothing easy about it. Fortunately, they stopped short ofoverloading my circuitry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is insisting on attending to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tell them tostop, or I kill everyone in this room, starting with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you will distract these people, I will attempt to depolarisethe power grid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The most direct route is blocked, but I believe we canuse a starboard service crawlway. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. The nature of their movement suggests a simple order ofintelligence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suspect they travelled through the transporter beam. That mayhave been the cause of Geordi and Ro's death. I will go to the Romulan ship. Perhaps I can discover the source of theemissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The drag coefficient is still present, but it has stabilised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a symptom of cascade failure. It would requireinitialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, it is five point three four times ten to the fortyfirst watts, sir. Well within the norm for this type of phenomena. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I get you a drink, dear? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm almost finished, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There is nothing wrong with the ship's sensors. Thereason we did not sense life signs aboard the escape vessel is becausethe prisoner has no life signs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. However, the Prytt have no link designed forextraterritorial communication. Our hail may come as a quite surpriseto them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why did you attack us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the maximum saturation level shouldbe eighteen point three percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How and when was it repaired? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. Theindividual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath theplanet's surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is from Europe's Napoleonic era, sir. Late eighteenth, earlynineteenth centuries. This is a campaign headquarters tent, his uniformis that of a French Army marshal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Class M readings from the fifth planet in the system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A common mistake, sir, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Five kilometres, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlimited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you foresee such a circumstance occurring? Is Ambassador Sarekunable to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There has been an accident on the holodeck, sir. Hasanything happened to the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodnight, Counsellor. Goodnight, Spot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. I have established contact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a piece of history. The opportunity to examine such anancient vehicle does not come around very often, and as you pointedout, we do have the time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: His cellular structure does not conform toany known species. His bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporalflux. I do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In what way, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spartan? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have only a few minutes before our next meeting, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My timing is digital. What? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Seventeen, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Oh, you are early. Just a moment please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You misunderstand. Counsellor Troi is a therapist. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, your transmission has been received <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since we have no contact with the Romulans for fifty three years,seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information wedo have, is out of date. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A chocolate sundae, for example. Although I do not speak frompersonal experience, I have seen it have a profound psychologicalimpact. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir. That would not be consistent with thedebris pattern. However, sensors indicate extremely high levels ofresidual antiprotons. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radiation and pressure levels still stable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Timothy, you understand that you may speak with me about anythingyou wish? Any subject? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We could remove the implant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: it was then that I began to suspect that your brother did not dieby his own hand. That he was, in fact, murdered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But it was done. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, I am damaged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The system's sun has entered a period of severe flareactivity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I would. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not my purpose. I would like to examine the remains ofAmbassador T'Pel left on the transporter pad. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thus far, that quality has not helped me to accomplish mymission. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure ishard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governorof H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border. CHILTON <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be the remains of a ship. Myanalysis indicates that it was an Antares class freighter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warp shell is definitely having an effect, sir. The anomalyis collapsing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinateamount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say Iam preoccupied. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly. There is a great deal ofinterference, but I am getting some readings. This is very unusual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel has assumed a position outside of the Rana system, andit is rapidly increasing velocity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Recent events have left me puzzled, sir. It has been days sinceIshara left, and yet my thoughts seem to dwell on her. Almost as if Iwere experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energy loss increasing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So a person fills in missing pieces of the puzzle with his ownpersonality, resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct andintuition as on fact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But if the answer is not forthcoming, your model will notfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probe launch successful. Telemetrytransmissions are being received. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data is dead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will see your ten, and raise you twenty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. Atthis rate, the sector will be completely filled with Enterprises withinthree days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Make a full report to the flagship. Take the main phasers offlineand begin radiation clean up on the affected decks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are showing broadband emissions, including Berthold rays <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That your interest in Kareen is not purely professional. Try asyou will, you cannot win her heart. She does not care for older men. Ormen of limited intellect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. I will be on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It's never been done, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gladly accepted, sir. As for Lore's abilities, his use of syntaxand grammar suggests he was given human memories similar to my own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion is extremely weak, sir. It appears to be movingslowly. It is gone, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However, fromwhat I know of him by his memories and his writing, I do not believe hewould be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now youhave destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believehe would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sadnow. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: They are moving inter-dimensionally. Neither transporters norforcefields will contain them, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There's limited information available onPakled culture, but the eclectic range of their equipment suggeststheir technology was borrowed from others. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you wish a frank evaluation? It lacks the harmony thatcharacterised this particular temple and Dokkaran culture in general. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You had nothing! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This residue would be the waste left behind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your restraint was most remarkable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an attempt at pure creativity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is what humans call a truism. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermallayer that has been cast off during moulting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why have I been brought here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far the material seemsrather very ordinary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is highly unusual. The crew is not at battle stations. Theship is on evacuation alert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest. However, Ican analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparativeconclusions about its possible effect on the human palate. But Ineither like it nor dislike it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That fact is not in dispute. However, you may have acted withundue haste and in doing so, unintentionally hurt Chief O'Brien'sfeelings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there has been an incident. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, someone is approaching. A humanoid. Forty metres dueeast and closing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But we have established that this is not a holograph. If I stepthrough and investigate, we could determine whether it is truly agateway. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish we were able to learn more about them,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Direct hit, sir. Moderate damage to their aft shield generators. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is responsible for the death of a Cardassian soldier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What have you learned about the tectonic stability around thedrilling sites? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this one is still alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The surface settlement appears to be all butdestroyed. Sensors show that the colonists now live in structures thatextend nearly three kilometres beneath the city. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The flow regulator is functioning properly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in the Betazed ceremony youmentioned. Could you tell us more? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. Theship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometresfrom here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That will not be necessary. Computer, end programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you could tell us something about thenature of your mission. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your decision was based on the assumption that cancelling thewedding would bring you happiness. This has proved to be incorrect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am Data. An android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We've regained ship's communication, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The emission is emanating from this direction. Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None so far. I have almost completed this experiment. May Ifinish before we return to Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, exactly how shall I proceed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ancient Doosodarians. Much of their poetry contained suchlacunae or empty spaces. Often these pauses measured several days inlength, during which poet and audience were encouraged to fullyacknowledge the emptiness of the experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Lieutenant. The crowd seemed a bit too ebullient forcomfort. Perhaps you would enjoy a quiet visit to the arboretum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. We have both been programmed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, it was not. When my status as a living being was inquestion, you fought to protect my rights, and for that I will alwaysbe grateful. The exocomps had no such advocate. If I had not acted intheir behalf, they would have been destroyed. I could not allow that tohappen, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifty two seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am a Starfleet officer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak. Thank you, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Its cargo holds are empty. The readout shows its guidance systemis malfunctioning. The pilot is attempting to hold course manually. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Talk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scattering field is down, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approaching the source, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Robots small enough to enter living cells. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have reached the bridge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to these records, there were no survivors. TheTralestas were annihilated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the rate the radiation levels areincreasing, the hyronalin additive will only be effective for anotherthirty eight minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you certain, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An aggregate field of plane-polarised objectshas just appeared. And disappeared. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with theoriginal circuitry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If she recovers and learns that she is an android <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Transient response is normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, have you been promoted in my absence? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will do my best, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. But humans still sneeze for other reasons and I cannot seemto do it right. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did I win? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifty two stars sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD. Itcorrelates with the debris we found. Colonel S. Richey. Rest in peace,Colonel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I had another waking dream, sir. But this time, I had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image Isaw. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because you are different. Differences sometimes scare people. Ihave learned that some of them use humour to hide their fear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that couldsupport life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The erasures were complete. However, an analysis of the subatomicstructure revealed an almost undetectable residualpattern. In time, we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrator'sauthorisation code. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have none. The rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion,but I am picking up no evidence of a subspace field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tip O'Neill. Accessing. Twentieth century male, politician,overweight, wearing female clothing, carrying a valise that looks likea fish. So, the juxtaposition of gender and an amphibian briefcase isfunny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it isalive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hyperonic radiation also interferes with ship's transporters. They are now inoperable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly. If you augment the thruster sequencing so that theinertial dampening fields <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A place? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You told a joke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three fiveseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a positive identification, Commander. It is the vesselthat attacked us earlier. It is re-entering the system at high velocityand is approaching Rana Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shuttlebay two, prepare for retrievalprocedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reason for failure? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Although I am technically proficient, according to my fellowperformers, I lack soul. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is very important. Are there any other sources of freshwater near the village? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, request permission to investigate this vehicle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our attempt to transport the chair neveroccurred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Confirm, sir. Navigation is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in thecaves underneath the planet's surface. This is the information yourequested, is it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Those phenomena are relatively common. We would need to identifyat least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He does. Moriarty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontationdesigned to test Federation defenses along the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite orepresent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Oh, we are us, sir, but they are also us. So indeed, we are bothus at different points along the same time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have often expressed dissatisfaction with the spartan natureof my quarters. Is this an attempt at embellishment? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, Lieutenant Commander Data here. Please excuse theunusual interruption, but under the circumstances I thought thatpatching communications through the holodeck programme would be lessobtrusive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will stay with Wesley, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One of these two logs is a forgery, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. We are not where we are supposed to be. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifteen thousand, three hundred eleven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child. Captain's log, supplemental. I have just beenadvised of a highly unusual project undertaken by Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigationalsystems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was discovered twenty six years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are having difficulty penetrating theinterior. However, the radiated output suggests a coherent system ofenergy storage and utilisation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am showing no transporter activity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle is out of control. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are no longer synchronous. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I had every right, Captain. I am man, he is machine. There is noquestion who must live and what must die. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They arereinforcing the tetryon emissions. They appear to be counter-acting thegraviton pulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nice to see you, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The starboard bulkhead of main Engineering is contained withinthe rock face, but most of its compartment is still intact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have created a small conduit breach in this tube. The exocompwould normally require several minutes to complete a repair of thistype. Once it enters the tube, it will find that a plasma cascadefailure is in progress. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Another lifeform. An ophidian. It seemsto be restricted by a forcefield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And of more immediate importance is your ability to work withingroups. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not accepting your commands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am on the Enterprise. How did I get here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will need to run a full biospectral analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may be experiencing the initial stages of yourtransformation. Early primates were often prey to larger carnivores. Asa result, their instincts probably included a heightened sense ofawareness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, active scanner output has increased by twenty sixpercent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am taking the warp-coil engines offline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I have no experience in such matters. I requireadvice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not want you to check my systems. I must resolve theseissues myself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have reinstated the same programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, configure a perimeter field charge,sections Nine K through Twelve T. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to othermembers of the crew who have attempted to care for her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am picking up a small metallic object, approximatelythree point five metres in diameter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will continue my experiment. I would like you to gather all thepieces of metal in the village and place them in this container. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need anothertreatment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In both cases, the time distortions occurredalong the same continuum as a preview or a reprise of a specific pointin time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of theNel system. Perhaps they will show different results. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constantof the universe is beyond our capabilities. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We had practised the piece, and I noticed that she played it thesame way during the performance. Every pitch, every intonation, wasexactly the same. Only an artificial life form could have done that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be following us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown. But it is definitely reacting to our presence. Perhapsit is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is Nuria the one in motion? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid, intelligentlife form, classification R3. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would entail the use of Klingon painstiks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most intriguing, sir. I assume a problem of inaccuratelytransmitted programmecoordinates due to the force field around the ship, sir. Are we alone,sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Blackjack. Accessing. Ah. Also known as twenty one, a numberwhich defines the object of the game. Picture cards are worth ten, acesone or eleven, all other cards face value. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest, Ibelieve it disrupted the space-time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, is the appellation Junior to be the life form's officialname? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, execute complete shutdown of theHolodeck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aftshields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, a Bajoran ship is approaching. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you are correct, he must be warned. The device has beenmodified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue wouldbe highly toxic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying objects andphenomena according to superficial observation rather than empiricalevidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire simply because it iscombustible, nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood,like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of differentchemical compounds, none of which is fire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch beingblown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I simply altered my premise for playing the game. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are approaching the Devolinsystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: During the last occurrence, I was able toconfirm one of my hypotheses. The unusual preponderance of dark matterin this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space. Asthe Enterprise moves through this nebula, it is colliding with thesedeformations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, at twenty million kilometres, our shields will only beeffective for eighteen minutes. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will be removing that equipment to my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that wasappropriate. I have given a great deal of thought as to what isappropriate in this instance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engines disengaged. We are now entering therift. Hull stress is increasing. Eighty three percent ofmaximum tolerance and rising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The scattering layer induced by the Tamarians is concentrated inthe upper D region. The shuttle will reach that area in approximatelytwo minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you know the nature of Doctor Manheim's work? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will not be possible to transport, sir. The Tamarian ship hascreated a particle scattering field on the planet's ionosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to yourrequest for access to their databases. They are now being transmittedinto our computer over subspace link. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across thespectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eightysix point five percent efficiency. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are picking up a faint distress signal on anopen subspace frequency. It appears to be coming from an adjacentsector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Adjust the invert two percent negative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe that is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The complex polysaccharides, in reaction with the carbon dioxide,produces an unusual combination of texture andeffervescence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How did the Conductor stop the train? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanning, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise, two to beam up. You must come with me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The weaker his position, the more aggressive will be his posture. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is slowing and is holding its position, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are most fortunate, my dear Captain, that I am not a violentman. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pick one to die, Captain, or I kill them both. RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of herdisappearance. While you claim to be just passing by, that is mostlikely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortablesubject. Am I correct? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will cooperate, Captain. You will cooperate or someone willdie. Who shall it be? How about the Klingon? Get another one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If she knew she were an android, we would have something toshare. I would no longer be alone in the universe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, as we move deeper into the nebula,sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trionium are continuingto rise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I need some visual assistance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Viewscreen on. Focus on area. Magnification factor ten. Increasemagnification to fifty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would seem to be reasonable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We do, sir, and your referring to him as an it suggests that I,too, fit into the category of a thing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Accessing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am reading a massive energy fluctuation in theplanet's atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can well imagine. The light in this room would make colourselection exceptionally problematic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is none present in the residue, either. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am familiar enough with your behaviour patterns to predictcertain decisions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scan the drive section for life form readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please explain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a misconception that all Rategs speak with a particularinflection. In fact, there are twelve different <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By developing the awareness to examine and question yourperceptions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing specific, sir. As you know, Ferengi technology isestimated to be generally equal to our own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Something wonderful has happened. I can takea deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain. I will never have toface death again. Think of the things I will accomplish over the nextthousand years! What? Oh, I know whatyou're thinking. There is no need to worry. I will create an androidbody for you, too. We can witness the end of time together. Why are youcrying, Kareen? I can love you now. The way I always wanted to. It wasnot right before. I was too old for you, too weak. Now I can beeverything you want me to be. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our present speed, three hours, twenty minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did itcome to be used in contemporary language? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have reached Engineering, Captain. Standing by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In spite of the fact that I am an android? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I regret the decision, but I must. I am the culmination of oneman's dream. This is not ego or vanity, but when Doctor Soong createdme he added to the substance of the universe. If by your experiments Iam destroyed, something unique, something wonderful will be lost. Icannot permit that, I must protect his dream. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know what I am. But I am not like you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why should anyone wish to expend his time in such a search? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is Commander Data. Go ahead, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You asked if I knew my name. I do not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gia. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Between the inhabitants of their two land masses, resulting inone group unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Well, sir, a good starting point may be, why was I given humanform? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The cigar, of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Anyon emissions are harmless. Pleasebegin immediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me for interrupting, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly the formation of a Kerr loop from superstring material. It would require high-energy interactionsoccurring in the vicinity for such a structure to be formed. The riftis certainly not stable, Captain. It could collapse at any time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no feelings of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Incidentally, Captain, the effects of the time distortions arenow being felt in the Ilecom system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not illusion, Lieutenant. They do exist, but they do not registeras either man or machine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But, Captain, will they not protest? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When Data speaks for me, can you hear my anguish, my despair? Data is a fine machine, but he cannot take the place of my chorus. Ittook years to develop a communication. That cannot be easily replaced. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. But it was a wonderful feeling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metrein diameter. There are no identifiable armaments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. I have not yet congratulated Ensign Cheney. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the moment, I would find it difficult to choose. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was the first clue, Watson. The vial contained strychnine,which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms. It is difficultto imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could haveheld on to so delicate a container without shattering it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Less than three hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You would be better off without my help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How does it feel? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lock on comm. link and boost. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, establish asecurity code for access to all functions previously transferred toBridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, run diagnostic on module L seven three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Removable? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir. I am content to stand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But it was proven to be fatal. To use this technology would be anirrational act. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are searching for instances of Iresine syndrome? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dismissed. Mister Worf, I am sorry if I have ended ourfriendship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a reasonable assumption. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would Counsellor Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speakwith Keiko? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show several objects in our path, sir. They are twentynine metres in length and are unmanned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which, traveling subspace, they should receive in fifty-oneyears, ten months nine weeks, sixteen days <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. But emotions were responsible for what I did to you. I wouldnever risk letting that happen again. My friendship with you is tooimportant to me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Good night, Captain. Sleep well, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillionbits. My total linear computational speed has been rated at sixtytrillion operations per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop. That was the stun setting. This is not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I can help, Captain. I have been able to determine thatCommander La Forge was abducted by Romulans en route to Risa. It islikely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot toassassinate Governor Vagh. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form replacingother less complex pathways. It was very disorienting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted messagebank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates thattwenty seven priority Starfleet messages are missing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He's being grilled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One could speculate that the E-band is being used for some formof covert communication. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, this appears to be the master subsurface pump. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I am right, sir, they are, and in this room. Their briefappearance coincided with the anyon sweep. Perhaps the anyonsneutralise the cloaking effect. Chief Brossmer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Difficult? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not possess the minute to minute remembrances of eachperson, although the more intense recollections are contained in mymemory banks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have analysed Commander Riker's structure. A syntheticT-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activatehis latent introns. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shuttle's entering the lower ionosphere, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A comparison modern scholars have drawn from Earth history likensthe Ferengi to the ocean-going Yankee traders of eighteenth andnineteenth century America, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will try to honour him in the manner in which he specified,will we not, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Professor Galen is still inside his vessel, sir. His vital signsare barely registering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am searching for a definition that will allow me to test anhypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solarradiation and the metaphasic shield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thruster is off. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Precisely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Never. I judge Lore to be superior in that desire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. It is much less Spartan, is it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The enemy is firing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, you are injured. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I understand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It does not appear in any Federation charts of theCorridor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These are various outposts and starbases where I have detectedunusual activity over the past few months. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most humanoids have the potential to be irrational. Perhaps youshould attempt to access that part of your psyche. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps, if we can find the ship which that Commander Worf'squantum signature. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do not wish to continue our lovers quarrel? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, your orders were to deliver the message, correct? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have finished. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am preparing to initiate a static warp shell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They seem to be re-programming the commands I have entered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two years, one month and twelve days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not wish to frighten you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Elevated CO2 levels at twenty kilometres, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ardra, before he responds, may I have a word in private withCaptain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I have discovered the basis of thecharges against Worf's father. Apparently the Klingons recentlycaptured a Romulan ship with logs that provided new information on theKhitomer attack. They clearly indicate a transmission from the outpostto the Romulan ship moments before the shields went down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The storm is beginning to subside, Captain. We should have a window in less than an hour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Almost. It is being stored in shuttlebay two. Sir. JR <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother, yet the complexity ofher design indicates she was created after I was. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. His name is Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? 3 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. I saw a straw coming out of your head. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can see we have a lot of work to do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. I have found the place where they werestanding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you will have to open it for me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing so far, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mark zero. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I am not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He will be unsuccessful, and will store the shape in his memorybanks. It will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eight, Ace, Queen. The dealer receives a four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The dilithium chamber shows no anomalousreadings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Rate exceeding critical level. Core densityis becoming unstable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then why are you here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since we have only experienced the phenomenon once, it isimpossible to estimate the risks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, that is extremely unwise. Worf may be much faster than <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The electromagnetic window on the planet is closing, sir. Threeminutes remain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand the source of your misperception. However, this isnot sleepware and I do not have a missus. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To give their lives meaning. A sense of purpose. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most interesting. Do you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will investigate the options. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps that is a part of our difficulty. Words are all we havebeen using. Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions. Irequire a phaser. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I now realise that my life aboard theEnterprise was a waste. My quest to become human was misguided. Anevolutionary step in the wrong direction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The consequences if we are caught <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you comfortable, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, please do not think this is an arbitrary decision. Ihave considered the ramifications of my actions carefully, and I do notbelieve it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, a game! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is designed so that each approach they take will spawn ananomalous solution. The anomalies are designed to interact with eachother, linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So it would seem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Okay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, I would say not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Wes! The transporter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry andrepair it two hours later? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is the only obvious choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A positive displacement of point zero zero four percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask a question? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no records of any negative thoughts about you. Hispersonal journals indicated that he was proud that you were such a finescientist. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did I? What I meant, sir, is that Daled Four rotates only onceper revolution. Therefore one side is constantly dark, and the otherside constantly light. One might surmise that the two hemispheres havedeveloped disparate cultures, which is a major cause of most wars. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do it! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The effect has been localised to within two kilometresof the wavefront. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is aware that our sensors are unable to track him, yet heseems to be purposely leaving a trail for us to follow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I may, Captain? Objection, your honour. In the year 2036, thenew United Nations declared that no Earth citizencould be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not entirely understand, sir. As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spockwould simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, continue monitoring the precise position of the echo. Any sudden change in its behaviour, initiate Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Say nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there something else you require of me, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Accessing. Negative, sir. There is no record of any Federationvessel encountering anything remotely like this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is alive, sir, but just barely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warship is capable of striking us with far more powerfulbursts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. If, on the other hand, the Captain makes even the slightesterror <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How did you decide? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Disruptors would be ineffectual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Back, sir? The Enterprise C would emerge in her own time periodat almost the same instant she left. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe there is any way we can know for certain,Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return toyour planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have an explanation, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, sir. We are on our way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A justified precaution, Counsellor. Mistress Beata observed thatMister Ramsey and his men are dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engine room attempting to comply, sir, but they caution us <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All systems functioning normally, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eventually, I developed a programmeenabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shipyard where the Enterprise was built. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This would appear to be manual override. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, it is important. Very. Eight weeks ago I received atransmission, a simple four word message, 'Is anybody out there?' Ianswered it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe is descending out of range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is evidence of some sort of disaster aboard the Enterprise,severe enough that the Captain ordered all hands to abandon ship. Ihave isolated three segments of the recording that are crucial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why are you suddenly being so helpful? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I must assume your decision is related to the discovery onEarth of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption intheir movement pattern during our last attempt to break away. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Lantree logs indicated that only one crewman had any illnessprior to arrival here. The First Officer had a mild case of Thelusianflu. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. Initiating tachyon pulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic, artificially reproducinga floral scent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The emerald tie pin. Presented to Holmes by Queen Victoria afterhe solved the theft of the Bruce-Partington Plans. A copy ofWhitaker's Almanac, which provided Holmes the key to the secret code inThe Valley of Fear. The snuff box of Wilhelm Gottsleig Siegesmann Vander Romstein. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Both of the other ships have been destroyed. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And you, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will go immediately, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They employ a subspace proximity detonator. A normal tricorderwould never detect it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No one regrets that necessity more than myself. You do understandmy reasons? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With one exception, sir. The particles would be converted into ahigh energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then re-directharmlessly into space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I wascausing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up. Doctor Freud, I am curious. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One moment. The phase buffer is functioning within normalparameters. Sensor efficiency has increased by six point seven percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are in need of medical attention. I will get a doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that Geordi upset their timetable when he saw thehidden weapons. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, drop the shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Elicit a desired behaviour by advocating its opposite. Thatimplies deception, does it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are his family. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since both planets are gas giants, neitherpossesses a solid surface. Their atmospheres, however, will come intocontact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer,recognise Picard, Jean-Luc. Alpha Two clearance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. One hour recess is granted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Too rich for my blood. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can accomplish more than that. If there is anothership, and we can reach them, we might be able to coordinate our effortsto free ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have noticed, Doctor <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. You are dismantling the primary power conduit. Imust ask you to stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You appeared to need it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix in Sector twenty onefive oh five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. I understand all too well. Removing the competitionwill not help you, Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am many things. Scholar, Artist, philosopher, lover, genius. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The factions on Solais Five are historical enemies. So many havedied that both societies are on the verge of extinction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher and I have been working on an interesting premise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twelve seconds to critical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Change in readings, sir. The life form has increased its energyoutput by fifty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Outside temperature is rising rapidly. One point seven millionKelvins. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchangefor information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are attempting to confuse me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Still nothing, Captain. I've conducted a full sensor sweep out toone light year from the Pasteur. No temporal anomalies, no particlefluctuations, nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But the Doctor <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not appear to be affected. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then it is alright for you to die, because I will remain alive. You know that I cannot grieve for you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving Starfleet orders granting a Lwaxana <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready for departure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, report to the Captain's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will return to the holodeck, where I will dare it to defeatme. And you, Madam, are invited to be a witness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain keysystems until primary control is restored. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Based on the last assumed position of the Klingon vessel, itsapparent trajectory, and our estimates of their cruising speed, weshould be in scanner range in fifteen hours, eight minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot help them. Captain, please take me back to Ramatis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We would completely burn off the planet's atmosphere. Captain's log, supplemental. While Doctor Moseleytakes La Forge's plan to the leaders of the colony, I find myselfweighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An android alarm clock. Is that amusing? They time how long Iremain unconscious. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Questionable, sir. I believe I can supply power to its playbackunit, but its components are quite old. I will attempt to amplify itsimage with my tricorder. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not entirely correct. While it is true the display iscurrently blank, this emptiness has a poetic meaning. Therefore itcannot be considered nothing as such. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two thousand five hundred degrees. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are free to stay here as long as you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we separate and blend in with thesebeings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An irony. It means that you have achieved in disgrace what I havealways aspired to be. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be advisable to monitor that cough. I have read thatthere is currently a cholera epidemic in San Francisco. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is why you must choose a gender, Lal, to complete yourappearance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is impossible, sir. The ship you are onhas violated a Federation outpost. It is my duty to stop it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Main power is offline. All systems are instandby or emergency mode. There is no response from any mannedstation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twelve seconds to impact, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Barradas Three is the only class M planet inthis system, and it is listed as unpopulated. However, sensors havedetected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There. I have instructed the computer to giveus a Sherlock Holmes-type problem, but not one written specifically bySir Arthur Conan Doyle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was you who <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you are right, Counsellor. It is now up to us to playalong. Release inertial dampers and cut power to decks thirty onethrough thirty seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can release it into the ship's atmospherein a gaseous state. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This isthe third unstable wormhole I have passed through during my time withStarfleet. The first was aboard the Trieste <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together. Wehad a considerable number of conversations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certain cyanoacrylates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I expect you to conform to the guidelines I have laid out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Some type of tractor beam has locked onto us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree. Geordi, I believe I've experienced my first emotion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, why should a king wish to pass as a commoner? If he isthe leader, should he not be leading? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the key to understanding the ship's behaviour lies inthe holodeck. All of the connection nodes intersect at that location. It is clearly some kind of processing centre. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They have discontinued their association. She has made the firstmove in initiating a relationship with me. What should I do? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In our previous encounter, Danar employed a strategy ofmisdirection in an attempt to gain his objective. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The plan was successful, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That analogy is essentially correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not understand how, but it is asking me if I wasconstructed for information exchange. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our destination is a point near the Boradis system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a reminder of friendship and service. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How far, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we're losing life support on decks eleven and twelve. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a high degree of probability that you are correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Everyone but myself was rendered unconscious. My positronicsystem is immune to the effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no need for companionship. However I do require somesupplies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If what the Professor has given me isaccurate, it is possible to repair the damage. But it must be perfectlytimed to coincide with another time distortion episode. RIKER <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lieutenant CommanderData. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I thought it was a topic you were interested in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have kept that somewhat vague, sir, but Sarjenka, that is hername, has been quite specific, telling me details of her family andfriends. And interspersed among these confidences have been somealarming references. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard ordered me to escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He can be reached at 221B Baker Street. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Right over there, sir. Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. We are ready <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No changes, Commander. I can detect no abnormalities in thestar's radiant energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The pleasure is mine, Hutch. I have been meaning to complimentyou on your choice of colours here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. The number of new circuit pathways has increased bysix hundred thirty two percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the purpose of this gathering confuses me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are identical to the coil we found earlier, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a matter of record, Portal. In the Age of Makto, thecentral star of the Tkon Empire destabilised and <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed. Or, stated more correctly, I wanted you to see me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My reading is intensifying, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are coming back online. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, youwill begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Instability. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly. However, the beings may perceive them as negligiblenoise rather than an attempt at communication. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This houseoriginally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It'sbecome the traditional residence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be more accurate to say it is good for me, as itlubricates my bio-functions. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to Starfleet records, Pierce and the other personsCounsellor Troi identified, were killed in an accidental plasmadischarge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be connected to several other systems as well,including the warp control circuits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. You will just move it again, and I will not help you hurthim. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Lal. I am here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, assume those paths are course corrections and derivegravitational values for stellar objects near those flight paths. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The boys appear to have reconciled their differences. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We may be more successful in deciphering the code they use totransport through the magnetic shield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is why I have asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If Ican produce a high frequency interphasic pulse, it may have a similareffect on the creatures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the contrary. I find it rather comforting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It seemed appropriate. Captain, you took a substantial risk inallowing the Enterprise to complete its task. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Barclay's performance was adequate, but clearly notrooted in The Method approach. I do not understand why. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whetherDoctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents werelost when the government was overthrown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, that would not be an atypical Romulan ploy. In theirlong history of war, the Romulans have rarely attacked first. Theyprefer to test their enemy's resolve. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And the reason for that, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bearing two seven one mark four, sir. She is headed into thesun's corona. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Temperature is rising in the core again,Captain. Two hundred and thirty million degrees Kelvin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The timing will be critical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor. However. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not saying that at all. I merely state a possiblealternative explanation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They can lead to wrong conclusions, but they cannot lie. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears Ensign Tyler still has a crush on you. It is clear youdid not speak to her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are experiencing a quantum-model oscillation delay, doublingin intensity every twelve point three seconds. Bio-cellular disruptionis imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields have registered an impact, however sensors show nothingin the vicinity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA:  <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, what he has in mind might provide us with vital information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that not the goal of every parent, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. The Captain would be ill advised to rely upon my judgement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors ofFederation territory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will endeavour to speed up the process, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields buckling, Captain. They will not <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They should add that Starfleet has permitted severalcivilisations to fall. We have at times allowed the strong and violentto overcome the weak. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principledictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end upseveral days before the event or several days after. There is no way totell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts, sir. Wehave been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Something is happening. A new subspacebarrier appears to be forming, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The last entry dated nine years ago, sir. By you. We are forced to abandon our starship. May she find her waywithout us. Apparently she did, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The question remains, why are they stealing these artefacts? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energy flow is within normal parameters, from the pre-firechamber to the emission aperture. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is necessary for us to learn the narrative from which theTamarians drawing their imagery. Given our current relations, that doesnot appear likely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The anomaly is nearly collapsed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but only at extremely close range. Even at minimalspeed, it would be almost impossible to manoeuvre the Enterprisequickly enough to avoid them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I beg your pardon, Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There were no records of sleep disturbances of any kind,Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have found a quicker way out of here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bridge to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He was called that here, but his memories indicate he travelledhere under a different name. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jayden. That is acceptable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show life forms aboard, but I am unable to ascertainwhether they are awake or dormant. However, the vessel's propulsionsystems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was this your intention from the beginning? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I now have the antimatter and am moving towards theopening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occurwithin seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. 3 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. The Alpha Omicron system is yet to be charted. Irecommend we take this opportunity for further research. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Her skills are empathic in nature. She is able to sense theemotions of other beings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ensign Williams' striking style is heavily influenced bygeometric constructivism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a skill my programme has never mastered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr? Doctor Marr, we must return to theintermittent signal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The initial dispersal pattern should not bemore than seven kilometres in diameter. Jenna? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your sister never spoke of you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm reading something off the starboard bow, but there is nothingthere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are attempting to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there willbe no more quakes, no morevolcanoes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, afluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why that razor, my friend? Why not the one I adjusted to perfectefficiency? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By order of Starfleet, I hereby take command of this vessel. Please note the time and date in the ship's log. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You're becoming agitated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient, I would notrecommend it, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I should have extended the sequence of events. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have a ship? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the alien vessel is coming within weapons range. Its shields are up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Minor damage to one ship. Its shields are holding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You cannot survive in this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warp field has collapsed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Throughout history, many lovers have suffered the samedifficulty. Anne Boleyn was quite distressed that Henry the Eighthpreferred the company of his huntsmen over that of his wife. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Thomas Halloway. Perhaps I should escort you to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In theory, a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasicresolution would be able to penetrate this much interference. TheDaystrom Institute has been working on such a device, but it is stillonly theoretical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Theoretically it is possible, sir. But it would take severalhours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanners are showing a window, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you're referring to the first productionmodel automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent ModelA might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong'srevised prototype. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No one laughed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is insufficient data to make such an assessment, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If Bok uses his transporter again, we might be able to trace thesubspace signature and locate his ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Disabling the detection system so her forces could attack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. Standard air pressure has been reestablished in theObservation lounge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why do you say that? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It projects an image of someone the subject will trust, gets asmuch information as possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My duty requires me to intercede. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Empirical study. Monitor the subject. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps something occurred during transport, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, long range sensors indicate another vessel approachingthis area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is by no means certain, Doctor, but I was referring to you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not really. My technique was to look for some thing, no matterhow small, that was common to both groups, and then to begin a processwhere one person or one group expresses themselves to each other. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were attempting to trace the source of themalfunction when it attacked me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see no reason to delay our departure. The chroniton fields havebeen cleared from all critical areas. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible, sir, that the events leading to my death will notoccur for years, even centuries. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our help was not deliberate. You deceived us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. When Tin Man returned me to the Enterprise, Irealised this is where I belong. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> DATA: That is correct. But I possess much of his knowledge. He wasworking on new detectors at the time of the attack on Omicron Theta. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The polarising effect being created by the beam may make itpossible for us to be detected. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We're right next to it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is the one worthy opponent created by the author, Conan Doyle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I have entered my Expressionistic phase. This is myinterpretation of the Battle of HarOS. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has all armament locked on us and ready to fire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Power has been restored, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inconclusive, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Based on all information presently available,the decision is correct. This is Lieutenant Commander Data speaking forthe Captain. Abandon ship. This is not a drill. All personnel. This isnot a drill. I say again, abandon ship. Allpersonnel, this is not a drill. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The wave has closed to one kilometre,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our shields will not withstand another assault. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because your gut tells you so? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would also like to volunteer, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the previous thirty four trials, I brought it back once thesimulated failure occurred. This time we were talking, and I neglectedto do that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this holographic image differs from any I have everseen. Could he have actually injured you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was not my intention to deceive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have been too literal with respect to my set design. Computer, modify holodeckprogramme Data seven three. Shakespeare'sThe Tempest, Act Five, scene one. Increasetorchlight by twenty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for theeffect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We arestill picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable. At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Within each disturbance it appears that time is moving at adifferent rate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A cold what? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beam appears to contain holographic imaging information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The technology required to achieve this biological and artificialinterface is far beyond our capabilities. There are many advantages. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That one was not created by the archive, sir. That is the claymask I originally made. I have since painted it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have unique skills that may allow me to succeed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I hope you enjoy it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a memory record of the entire lecture, Counsellor. I canrepeat the portions you missed, if you <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Her environment, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The district he represents is called the Krocton segment. Hemaintains a dwelling there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. It is just that for a moment, the expression on your facereminded me of her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is a biospectral analysis of the temporal aperture. Theorganic readings originated from these dark spots. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, I do have a request. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you remember, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Conceivably, the ship's power distribution nodes are vulnerableto those frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because our sensors are showing a responder echo, sir, on thefrequency they once used. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is it not customary to request permission before entering anindividual's quarters? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will initiate radiation protocol when necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortionfield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have reviewed the vessel's mission plans. The Raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere, eleven thousandkilometres below its current position. The crew was to sample theatmosphere at that level, and then return to a safer orbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But there was no mention that my father was married to you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only that it is the difference between night and day. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Transceiver signal is down forty two percent. Navigational inputs are not registering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet has responded to our request, sir. A tug willrendezvous with us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase Nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Separation is successful, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that not a part of the human experience? Growth and change? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This new concentration of energy was detectedonly after the surrounding material became inert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The deflector dish has been reconfigured, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please identify yourselves. I must know what you are trying to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are all aware of the tape of the last Federation starship tocome in contact with the Jaradan. It graphically demonstrates whathappened when that Captain offended them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Better is a highly subjective term. I do not, for example,possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ambient light in this location accentuates its contours. However, a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aestheticcriteria. A more central location will carry added meaning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Among humans, a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship, orindicate support, attraction, affection. In this context, I must assume that your intention was to expresssupport. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not ordering him to do anything. I am merely trying topersuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. Do you believemy suggested course of action should be followed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But Commander, the Dremans are not a subject for philosophicaldebate. They are a people. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All I have found sir, is what you already know. Manheim wasconcentrating on time gravity experiments when he left. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Congratulations, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Too late. My brother suggested that I try to developmy sense of humour. What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We should try to find the commonalties in these events. Wherewere the people you were with? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Transistor material. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One is an infant. Another is elderly. Two are middle aged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe Lieutenant Worf understands all the nuances ofthis betting procedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison. Possibly a racewhich those life forms have planted here. Much as we plant humancolonies on Class-M planets. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree the existence of such a message is remote, but I believewe should check. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I do have something to gain from it. Your continued presenceon this ship. Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I did not succeed in my efforts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The databanks that identify who I am are not functioning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you do not believe she should know the truth? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. I suppose none. I just wanted them. Is thatvanity? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My design models suggest that Beta will eventually experiencerising temperatures, erratic tide surges and in general the beginningsof global warming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Core transfer is engaged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to historical records. This will be the firstopportunity for a Federation team <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to penetrate the Borgregenerative subcommand path. It is a low priority system and may beaccessible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes sir, I believe I have. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you could arrange for us to get in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hit me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Three hundred twenty seven, to our knowledge. We can probablyachieve an exact match with a random computer search. It will takeapproximately three hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will have your answered questions as soon as possible,Professor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and beginrepairs of the starboard power coupling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is home, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, if a face to face negotiation would be helpful, I wouldlike to volunteer myself as a conduit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A message from planet Haven, Counsellor. They wish to beam theMiller wedding party aboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can provide you with our analysis of the communicationsbetween the Khitomer outpost and the Romulan ships. However, for acomplete record you will have to contact Starbase twenty four <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The answer, I believe, Doctor. The Lantree was not the source ofthe disease, but it was the trigger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. I have not considered that. And Captain Picard hasbeen a role model in my quest to be more human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am fine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The data from the Barzan's probe of thewormhole are quite impressive, Captain. The wormhole delivered theprobe beyond the Denkiri Arm, in the Gamma Quadrant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you know anything about it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been unable to contact Sarjenka. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulsesin the other two time periods. I suggest shutting them down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cowardice is a term that I have never heard applied to Tasha. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Direct hit. Engineering Section and deck forty two. Shieldgenerators are overloading. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dytallix B is the fifth of six planets circling the red giantknown as Mira. One side always faces the sun, where temperatures reachup to one hundred and eighty degrees. The mines line the temperate zonebetween the day and night sides, but they are long deserted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You got it, partner. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish I could feel it with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They came looking for me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe what could be termed the Manheim Effect is becomingmore pronounced. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am now attempting to access the long rangesensor array. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was Lieutenant Barclay who first suggested a link between thetwo incidents. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To what end? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir, but it will take some time to decipher thepatterns. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Power connections are complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving a signal from dead ahead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have overridden Danar's bypass. Shuttlebay two is once againinactive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were right, sir. I do tend to babble. Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever theobject or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a nemesis. It isone thing to communicate with something mysterious, but it is quiteanother to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether itunderstands the same concept of reason that we do? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have analysed the probe's sensor logs. There are norecord to indicate the presence of a living human on board the Raman. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been unable to create a neuralpath around the Borg implants, sir. It is Captain Picard himself whohas somehow managed to initiate contact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are xenophobes, sir. Isolationists. The Paxans terraformed aprotoplanet in this system in order to better conceal theirwhereabouts. The apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trapdesigned to keep out invaders. The energy field stuns everyone on boardthe invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Counsellor was unsuccessful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I take it that is your name? May I inquire as to yourdestination? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there appear to be three of us. 1 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. That is not correct. My creator Doctor Soong, gave me aprogramme which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I havea conscience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And he will require water. And you must provide him with a sandbox. And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat, and a goodcat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are entering the Lysian system, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have just started the scan. Did you not go to Sickbay? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sexual attraction in this context is not a part of myprogramming. I am an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Take my Worf. Please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays. We arebeing boarded, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. We are a family, Lal. Chair. To sit in. Sit. Good. Painting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inform Starfleet Command that we will hold this position untilfurther notice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Deck fifteen. Lal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds remaining. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Speed increasing, sir. Warp seven point six,seven point six five. Warp seven point seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlike a canine, Spot does not respond to verbal commands. Goodbye, Spot. He will needto be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement number twenty five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, there are life forms present in that biolab. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The transporter beam is focusing on decknine, section four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My hair does not require trimming <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs. Apparently when they are in these slots, they become part of the wholeand no longer read as separate life forms. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate that the large circle is aportal or airlock, possibly leading to the interior of the sphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Really? Did you know that there are currently five Tyrelliansserving aboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree. What do I do? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And you suggest that anything which exhibits thesecharacteristics is considered alive? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Level-five probe sequence ready for launch, Commander. On yourmark. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Phase dampers are in synch. Standing by to modulate the transportpattern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty todefeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which Ipossess. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So, by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine tothe third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distancebetween the Omicron system and the Crab Nebula. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness. Shehas cancelled the wedding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, if I do not succeed, how violent is the Sheliak reactionlikely to be? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated responseto a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is also the possibility that the phasers will supply theassimilators with what they need most. Energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They do correspond to Mogh's personal security code. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff dissolved your relationship, Isaw an excellent opportunity to study that aspect of human intimacy. Asyour friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive in times of need. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I, however, am not sure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating interface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Borg are extremely computer dependent. A systems failure willdestroy them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways. But I would gladly give it upto be human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is the commanding officer of the Cairo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. One which I have just created for romantic relationships. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, that is true. There will be no one left alive to remember. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All life on the planet is being destroyed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At present course and speed, ten hours fifty three minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have considered that possibility as well. It may also be thecase that every starship in the Federation is equipped with anartificial lifeform such as myself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Plot a course and take us back to Barradas Three. Notify the awayteam to prepare for transport. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period. It is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yet we are not headed for a specific colony. The coordinatesgiven are outside the Boradis system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Pagh is either cloaked or destroyed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays,sir. We will have the results of the analysis in approximately tenminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have run three complete self diagnostics. All of my systems arefunctioning normally. Perhaps Doctor Freud was correct. The knife Idreamed about is theembodiment of my unconscious desire to inflict violence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At warp nine, five hours twenty minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warbird has completed its sensor sweep. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I may know what has happened, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Analysis bears out that the object wasdefinitely terrestrial in origin, dated mid twenty first century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the alien's. However, they are significantly less complex. Its cellular structureappears to be in a state of mitosis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is to be done with them, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a large chamber twenty metres ahead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your parents will be safe now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He has a child's body, but we have found him to be much more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are dozens of Bajoran camps on thethree class-M planets. I suggest we may want to begin on Valo Three,where an adhoc leader named Jas Holza lives. The Federation has hadseveral dealings with him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first and third E-band blips were clearly generated on boardthe ship. The second came from the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wonder if that is so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Main power is offline. I am switching to backups. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, your message said urgent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am simply trying to make an objective assessment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not appear to be attacking the outpost, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stable. But we have maintained warp factor nine for longer thanis recommended, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Structural integrity of the barge has been compromised. Disintegration is continuing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then it is perfect timing, Doctor. What better occasion tointegrate my results into your study? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry to bother you, but I have a question of a personalnature. Do you have a moment? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, we are approaching Klavdia Three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify atransmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near GalorndonCore twelve hours ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Changing to twenty pulses per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal suffered complete neural system failureat thirteen hundred hours. I have deactivated the unit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, a low mileage pit woofie? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The foremost authority in cybernetics. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant? May I ask a question? In the absence of empiricaldata, how will you determine whether or not this is the real Kahless? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I am able to resume my duties. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The range is at least several thousand light years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have begun training her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age fifty five, occupationfinancier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was unusually compact, yet extremely powerful. Its recordedwind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should investigate this matter further. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And for this opportunity, she is willing to provide services toassist you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The nanites in the upper core are all dead, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the energy flowing through that arc were interrupted by anonconductive material, it is likely the circuit would be broken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And then to outlive them as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they areall too young to be Miranda Vigo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Set phasers to twenty five percent. Return fire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The analysis of the fragments is not yet complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker suggested this particular flower. He said it hadworked for him in the past. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Warp enginesare coming back online. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain I do. Perhaps you could clarify them for me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In human parlance, I do not believe I can getthe job done. My training has prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact I am proving to be <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With my repository of knowledge, I expected to perform betteragainst a humanoid life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And it has nothing to do with CommanderRiker's new assignment? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The patterns are clearly artificial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering. To function aboard a starship,or in any human activity, you must learn to form relationships. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They were more than my interpreters. They were also my friends. They were a part of me. I did not realise how much a part until now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beacon is in place, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not precisely, Geordi. True fossilisation requires severalmillennia. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Feline supplement seventy four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter isdecaying more rapidly than predicted. It may not be possible to traceit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will scan their warp signatures. Sir, sensors indicate theattacking vessels are Federation ships. RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The upper portion of the apparatus seemsto be a holding facility for the energy segments. There are hundreds,perhaps thousands of these fragments inside. I have resumed a northerlydirection. There is no evidence yet of humans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radiation levels within acceptable limits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increasing by fifty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excellent, Doctor. We still have seventeenminutes left. I will inform the away team immediately. Enterprise toRiker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe Guinan does keep a limited supply of non-syntheholicproducts. Perhaps one of them would be to your liking. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I too. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, I disagree. Captain, there is nothing in this room toindicate it was used as a military command centre. Perhaps atransporter room? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I cannot take pride in my abilities. I cannot take pleasurein my accomplishments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tracking torpedoes. Entry programme confirmed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Disappearances fitting the profile of the Hera have rarely endedwith the safe recovery of ship and crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was the only way to save the other two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The amplitude is still rising, Captain. Resonance is approachingcritical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are still receiving their signal, Captain, but there is nomessage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a disruptor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? I have a personal favour to ask. I considered CommanderLa Forge to be my best friend. I believe it is my responsibility toplan and conduct the memorial service. May I have your permission to doso? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, Chancellor Alrik is waiting to receive you inholodeck seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. We must leave, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All systems normal, sir. Sickbay reports that Lieutenant Juarezwent into labour at zero four hundred hours. We remain at stationawaiting the arrival of Starship Zhukov and guest quarters have beenprepared for Ambassador T'Pel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The saline fluid is their circuitry, and to prevent its loss,they killed Malencon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of hissecurity precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You wished to see me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Query. Eager beaver? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is clear that I need guidance to resolve this situation. Counsellor Troi's advice should be useful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so that the force ofthe explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The code is valid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suspect the last thing Counsellor Troi would have wanted is forthe two of you to be alienated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The third is just coming into range now, sir. It is AmbassadorClass heavy cruiser, Horatio. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You're welcome, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will have to draw power from the life-support systems in orderto discharge the collectors. This is Acting Captain Data. All personnelwill report to designated shelter areasDATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I look forward to the time we spend together. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eleven point seven five, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was, and the exocomp must have realised that. It saw thatthere was no real danger and completed the repairs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not your puppet anymore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would consider them insignificant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer. Programme an audience appropriate to this venue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As in a human brainwave pattern? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I have speculated, the presence of refractory metals <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not yet, sir. But with your help, I am learning. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. I will. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've traced it through our sensor channel,sir It is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The input levels are currently at fifty three percent oftolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his ownemotional awareness to understand the character he plays. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is considered to be funny? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is a very complex set of variables to coordinate, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Someone is reading every file, every bit of information stored inthe Enterprise memory banks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This woodland pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because itduplicates Earth so well. Coming here almost makes me feel humanmyself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It could indicate the course of the Borg ship, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is holding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The transfer itself is fairly simple. Eachneural pathway in my brain is duplicated precisely in hers. Theoretically, the duplicate brains should be able to store and processthe same information but until all of the transfers are complete, wewill not know for certain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, is this it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As well as the crew records, and the personal logs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm cancelling the test. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've practised my best Academy courtesy, nowit's time for you to go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any word from La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't've made the mistake of leaving you. I know thatmuch. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're prepared to talk, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give me everything you've got. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And how much would your confidence cost? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does her husband know anything about this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is it? I can't see it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any ideas? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Matthew! Pola! You know this area is off limits. Come on, comeon. Boys will be boys, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher asked me to steer you past Sickbay. She saidyou've been looking very tired. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most important. You may want to start with something like this here. You are the mostbeautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We cross the border in thirty seconds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's twenty years too late. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it my imagination, or is something bothering the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm here for the briefing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you do the same thing with the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rossa? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Ensign Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think they were after? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She never said anything to you about being pregnant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In your sector? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you track the source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course for the next search grid. Stand by to engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you wish. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here we go. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me know if it reoccurs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Drop your shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What kind of needs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Above, look out! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's Talarian. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aren't you going to answer that, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you need to continue to develop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's the problem. I'm too comfortable here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you werereferring to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you discussed this with him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're here, Mister Worf. Stand by to transport five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As you say, Captain. Riker to La Forge,return to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up! Go to Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. Good luck. First Officer's log, Stardate 42479.3. We leave theSolais system confident that Riva will help the Solari achieve alasting peace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try warp engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want your command. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What kind of drop can we expect? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we get out of it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Inertial dampers compensating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I may get over there and want to come right home. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew evaluation reports. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage, Mister Crusher. First officer's log, stardate 42761.3. We have notbeen able to determine why, or how, Captain Picard left the Enterprise. We can't even be certain he is in the missing shuttle, although that isthe assumption on which we areproceeding. For the last six hours, we have been searching withoutsuccess. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The soonest we could intercept? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Full stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here you go, Vanessa. A little something for you, too. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are starsand the universe worships the night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pawn to king's bishop three, Queen's level. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good luck, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bottom line, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago. They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's recordsare virtually non-existent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The scattering field is still in full force. What the hell iswrong with them? Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ourscan. Riker to O'Brien. Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you been able to remember anything that happened after heattacked you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not exactly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want to destroy all the life on an uninhabited,neutral planet with no strategic importance whatsoever? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You think this is funny? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I meant on your shore leave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I believe we've have the answer to what happened overthere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Permission to speak candidly, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have much choice, do we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border. I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If shefinds out anything, I'll let you know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And that's not all! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In case it should become necessary to fight, could you arrangeto find me some rocks to throw at them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not altogether. Astrophysics reports that the star's rate ofcollapse has increased. It could go supernova in the next few days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard sends his birthday wishes. He was needed on theBridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And deadly. The last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem. Now there's nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! That's not what you said. You said I can't. You used acontraction, didn't you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A different rendezvous? I'm not sure I know what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have beentampered with, and we are close to Klingon space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Ready when you are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Geordi, Tasha. WORF <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate no life forms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We appear to be on a course for Tambor Beta six. It's a whitedwarf star. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excellent. Exactly what I need. Ah, Mister Worf. And the goodDoctor, bearing gifts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've felt better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to fire. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock on the Captain, bring him back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On our last stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Picard, this is Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it would be nice if you took us back to Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We've almost reached the nacelle tube. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look at them. They're certainly not Jarada or Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's starting to get busy around here. Fivenew science teams just beamed in from the Zhukov. Quarters are fillingup fast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No argument? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Already been taken care of. She's transporting over at oh sevenhundred. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the matter with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Riker to transporter room two. Prepare for emergencytransport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I intend to demand the highest level of performance from her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise? Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. Thank you, Counsellor. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It can't hurt you to listen, can it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And who will tuck him in at night? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. Could we just continue with the evaluation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're in position now, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look, I'll review the situation and let you know as soon as Ican. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That! Geordi! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just take twelve point five million, the purchase price of thishotel. Spread the rest around. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security personnel, full alert. Shut downall shuttlebays, transporters, and turbolifts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have any. If we're going to get out of here, we'regoing to have to do it on our own. I'm going to get some answers out ofthat desk clerk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe they were part of the Borg collective. One ofthem referred to himself as I. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe there's a way we can all help ourselves to remember more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it's free. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made from sugar and spice,and boys are made from snips and snails. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reverse engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm going back to the nineteenth century to get the Captain. Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who would have thought we'd see him laugh out loud like that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no proof of anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, I hate to break this up, but <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Follow me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, Data, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An admiral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. I think theresemblance is rather striking. Wouldn't you agree, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain's death hit me pretty hard, and I may not becompletely objective, but there is no one who is more determined. Iwon't rest until I find out who's responsible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have a mother ship who should be advised of yourcondition?  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So the crew wakes up and thinks they've been through a wormhole,count their blessings and keep going. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. If we stay on our present course, we should rendezvous withher intended groom in thirty one hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you mind telling me what's going on here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on your planet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He usually is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I guess I'll have to back out of Beverly's play after all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: By all means. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bortas is standing by, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, we'll do it the old-fashioned way. Set a course forthe Federation, warp thirteen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself. Maybe he can find something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. What is it? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You did a good job. I'm proud of you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They murdered a man in cold blood in full view of everyone inthe bar and you can't remember anything about them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will we have, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wish we had some sign that he's in here. I guess we have nochoice but to risk it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was Doctor Crusher's idea to simulate theblue gill. We had to make sure it would fool everyone, including you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, First Officer of the USSEnterprise. You have a lot to learn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. How can the Federation help influence yourchildren in your traditions? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've been out there a long time, Data. There must have beensome deterioration. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just hope we don't all beam back lookinglike Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Talk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed, Captain. Hold present position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just lie still for a while. We'll get you to Sickbay as soon aswe can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know, but this is different. He's different. I can't put myfinger on it, but I'm worried. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Uh oh. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From what we've seen on the Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not havetime to help herself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're not going anywhere until we get to the truth You're a spy,aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think there's any possibility ofdeveloping sites in this region. Most of the stars are main sequencebinaries. There are no M-class planets. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll call you the next time I pass through your star system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No objection. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Atmospheric systems are down twenty sevenpercent. We're going below tolerable oxygen limits. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Four years. Ever since Captain Picard was killed in the incidentwith the Borg. You don't remember any of this, do you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In what sense? It sounds like he put you through hell. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ethan, no! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Direct all evacuees to decks nine and ten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mauric is determined to take his protest tothe Federation Council, but I don't think he'll get very far. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll manage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So we can beam through a higher distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I see you in the Observation Lounge, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are no civilians among the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make that we. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing foryou to do now is to ask to get Tasha back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no time to debate the issues. You're going with uswhether you choose to go or not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your twenty and I'll raise you fifty. You're going to call mybluff, aren't you. I think I'll quit while I'm ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's worth a look. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no sign of any survivors. No sign of anyone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when we don't accept their offer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I object! There is no basis for calling Crewman Tarses a liar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn it! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's going to die. They're all going to die. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, there's half a million amps flowing through that arc. Could your body handle that much current? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alexander! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exactly the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she letsyou know what's on hers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock sensors on Nuria. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are a lot of what appear to be experimental enginecomponents lying around over there. I'd say they were testing a newwarp drive design and it blew up in their faces. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fifty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's the time allotted that concerns me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we should let him try it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The lives of fifteen thousand people areriding on you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker will not survive if I am removed. He has done enough. Yourword. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He tells a hell of a story. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker,First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We think we can assume the Captain is aboard that shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And for the last thirty eight years I havesurvived here. I have come to understand that the alien contaminatorscreated this place for me out of some sense of guilt, presuming thatthe novel we had on board the shuttle about the Hotel Royale was infact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits. Obviously,they thought this was the world from which I came. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you're not comfortable with that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And that surprises you, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Rikerat Farpoint Station. Standing byto beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Matta! I had you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have that kind of time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then if we can learn nothing from you, we'll leave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You reacted fast, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The transmission that we intercepted was probably a homingsignal. We have to assume they're on their way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship. No one would know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was vague, the way you recall a dream. I remember thesensation of feeling trapped and something about a smooth surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me, sir, but those weren't natural instincts. Those werepoker instincts. A card game doesn't exactly prepare me for this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We still have the problem of retrieving the database. Thecomputer on the station is not completely operational. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi's uniform. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maintain the approach attitude, Data. I'm taking her in. Bracefor impact. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No possible explanation at all? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Guinan? I don't remember you ever callingthe Bridge before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Junior adjutant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready, Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there anything like this on record? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll have a complete power survey donewithin the hour. We'll probably have to supply them with energy forlife support, and they'll need a new engine core to get home. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hail the Tamarian ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We received yourdistress call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which reports do not conflict? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that Iconia? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, beam one to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief MedicalOfficer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't care what he's been running. I just ran out of patience. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's a shuttlecraft doing out this far? Where's its mothership? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My beard is not an affectation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great. Just great. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What doyou want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, we were just discussing the situation we're all in. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting that we warp over to Starfleet headquartersand demand to know what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you know <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. There is an antique revolving door. It could be anentrance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You go ahead. I'll be finished by the time you get back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You are on board the Federation Starship Enterprise. We'retreating your injuries. How long were you down on Galorndon Core? Doyou understand me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you in or not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just windowdressing for a dead man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't imagine war ever feels right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got to get out of here, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll see, won't we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? There is. Deck Twelve. The gymnasium. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're not going to make it, Captain. If we had just a minute orso. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I suppose that's your loss. We consider our families one ofour strengths. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You wouldn't have recognised her. Her dress, her hair,everything about her. I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been toanyone, but last night she was someone that I had never seen before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which might start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war,and we still might not be able to save the captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You had a strange way of showing it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Detail? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The rematerialisation subroutine has been disabled. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why should we petition to entry to an empire that no longerexists? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've been studying the sensor logs and the torpedo telemetry todetermine if there was any malfunction. If there was, and we are ableto isolate the problem, another test might be successful. In themeantime, all of our facilities would be made available to DoctorTimicin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What could be causing it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you aware of the details of the Battle of Maxia? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our systems came back online a few minutesago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's worse than we suspected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shuttlebay two, stand-by to launch the Egg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If he rigged it, could you prove it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's what we were thinking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Check him out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Goodnight. Captain's log, supplemental. The third transportwindow has opened and the away team is making their final attempt atretrieving the database. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Normally? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Option one is beginning to sound better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then it's my job to see nothing goes wrong. Did I said somethingwrong, Captain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're in orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we transmit visually. Do yourespond? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Advise Mister Barclay to join us on the Bridge immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This time you've got me. I haven't a clue. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry to resort to such drastic measures, Minister, but youleft me little choice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Custody? On what charge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Never heard of it. Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's happening, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can I help you, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And how are your friends, Keiko, Guinan and Ro? JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Split pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmedinto the replicators. Well? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could be a ship's log recorder, or a probe casing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At ease, Lieutenant! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right away. Data, Yar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could we get through with our phasers? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, you take that area. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You taught me that word means my beloved. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Put a tractor beam on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She was a formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you open a channel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Were you able to contact the boy's parents? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very charming. It has your touch. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long does he have? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stardrive section only? What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe he just wants a big laugh. He'll take Bre'el Four to theedge of disaster, and then pull the moon back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Discharged? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make that on the same starship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You are my friend, and in spite of everything I've said, if it were my place, I would probably help you. But I've been studying Klingon ritual and Klingon law, and I've discovered that it's not my place to fill that role. According to tradition, that honour falls to a family member. Preferably the oldest son. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold your position, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have we got our phasers back? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Kolrami, when I agree to do something. I do it. Do youcare to surrender now, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we gain control of her systems remotely, we could activatethe viewscreen. That way we could at least look at the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep me posted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I've always wanted to see you as a brunette. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The game isn't big enough unless it scares you a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley? Good. We'll need an extra hand around here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've entered the first system. I think youmight want to come to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just human nature, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you mind if we take one of these with us and have our peoplestudy it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give us a tight visual, Data. Is it my imagination or does itlook a lot meaner this time? Shields up. Weapons ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay with them. Riker to O'Brien. Can you get a fix on theCaptain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then tell him that there is no way <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Probably just a symptom of stage fright. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, are you sensing any sort of interference from theCalamarain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have no questions, Your Honour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Congratulations, sir! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, no offence, but I have trouble believing that the man Ithat escorted to deck eight is supernatural. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, signal them on subspace. Request their status. Geordi, seeif you can tell if it's one of ships we've been looking for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from thesame clan. What does that tell us, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I'd like to live in this place. A little stuffy formy taste. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. They don't usually go through the ceremony if it'sjust a temporary assignment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, I think I like it. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It could be Morag. We don't know for sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Contact Starfleet, request all logs of the Intrepid. Riker toDoctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I did what any good helmsman could have done. You did it first,sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would they attack us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll arrive about an hour before the storm gets there. It willtake at least two hours to evacuate all the colonists off the surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, if what you say is true, where am I? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet. There appears to be some kind of a slickblocking our path. Will keep you apprised. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riva! 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it true that he'll be retiring after this mission? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got a man held hostage by alien forcesand all I have are no-option options. I need some input. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This must be the sign they were waiting for. Mister Data, youwill be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst. As soon asevery else is unconscious, I need you to get to the computer panel andstop that ship somehow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll have to take your word for that because I don't rememberany of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want toremember. I guess there's only one thing we can do. We've got to buildsome new memories. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Captain, Data's gone ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give me a direction. T'SU <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know who any of these people are? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another Romulan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll go next. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I tend to agree with Mister Worf, Captain. I think we shouldlimit their access while they're on board. They don't need to have therun of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As I said, we're having trouble contacting you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It certainly is. The good life, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Trakian Ale. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostiletoward human life? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I waited a long time. I guess I can wait a little longer. Take care of her. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> RIKER: All stations have reported, Captain. Thereappears to be no immediate threat to our ship or the crew. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Able. A good officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the twenty fourth century, we're on Devidia Two, andyou're not supposed to be here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is insubordination, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She seems too delicate for such a task. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Ral, congratulations on winning the rights to the Barzanwormhole. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There was another difference. I don't believe they were part ofthe Borg collective. I think they were acting as individuals. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's okay. I guess I really wasn't paying attention. I'd bettergo to Sickbay. We'll continue this later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sending Hugh back to the Borg was a very risky, a very dangerouschoice, but it was the moral thing to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know this must be disturbing, Governor,but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan. Ihave his skills, his thoughts, his memories. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing for Ficus. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You will bring it to the Bridge, immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Posted by proud parents? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Troi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd be having more fun than searching the ship, I'd imagine. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd giveher a challenge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, request permission to board on the Yamato with an awayteam. Perhaps something we can find on board in the logs will help usfigure out what happened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you got them, O'Brien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see if we can establish a new upper limit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. Concentrate shields at that point. Make it so. I hopeyou're right, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, Captain. It's going to be okay. Here we go. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Barclay! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't know how long I've wanted to tell you that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The planet Kurl? It's a hell of a long way outside Federationterritory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life isin danger. Step back, Yuta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare for impact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's our mysterious something, Captain. It is a forcefield ofsome kind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's an understatement. I can't even <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who is here with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Back so soon, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's not look for problems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Intense storm activity over the southernpole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace ofthe Essex. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The tricorder indicated triolic activity from most of the bodieswe looked at. If the aliens left that sort of signature, they'll bedetectable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Automaton. Made. By whom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm ready for that briefing whenever you are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What made you change your mind, Hugh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bortas has put out a general distress call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come to intercept course. Keep us out of the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If there's an apple? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was going to explain this to you after the ceremony, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm having a little debate with the colony's leader. Itseems <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, orWorf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your empire fell prey to a supernova. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this foranything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It looks if half the ship materialised inside solid rock. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screencommunication so we can see each other <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Life support has failed on decks seven andthirteen, sir. Now what if this thing manages to rewrite our entiresystem? It's so far beyond us that we don't have a hope ofunderstanding it, let alone controlling it. Our own ignorance couldkill us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Iceman wins again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, extend shields around the ship. Lock on the tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure she'll feel the same way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The star is still collapsing. We're directlyin the path of <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It worked. The shields are dropping. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's all this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like a rag in a dog's mouth. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It won't happen again. We apologise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever they are, Troi's convincedthey're human. They may be trapped somehow. We're not sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll try to stay out of the way. We've never seen aterraforming station, and we appreciate the opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we get him out of there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In a manner of speaking he is. I'm not going to be disturbinghim, I'll just give him the message. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll play these. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right, there is. You could spend the next monthmemorising all the technical manuals in the computer, I still don'tthink you'd pass the test. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There is nothing more important than this, son. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gul Lemec has arrived. He's waiting for youin the Observation Lounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all, Groppler. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Weapons. power, communications. We're being stripped one systemat a time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any reason why it shouldn't be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. Once more time. And again. How many cards? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. Take us to the battlecoordinates, Mister Crusher. Yellow alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Was he bluffing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can respect his beliefs, but he is asking me to take an active role in his committing suicide. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you conscious? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. But after your tailor is done, would you join me in thecargo bay? Mister La Forge has made some progress with the metalfragments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I sent Worf to check the weapons locker on the relay station. There's a phaser missing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, you might be right, but I'd like to give the crash site aonce over first. Maintain our current orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will it affect Geordi the same way? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long wayto go. A long way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are they recovering? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any hostile move on our part could jeopardise Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost peopleon missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with thisthing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we canrisk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. We'll make all preparations. Commander Data, return tothe Enterprise immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anticipating the worst, do you think they can be whipped intoshape in forty eight hours? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Didn't your readings indicate a class M planetbefore we passed through the wormhole, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, indeed. With his mother gone, who will see to his studies? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is this an official report, Lieutenant?  LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Problem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we don't know what we're looking for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My insides are still shaking, but I'm all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coming about. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on target. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have you assigned to cabin seven thirty five. Deck si <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I cheat. I'm kidding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: William T. Riker, Commander, SC two three one dash four twoseven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know who any of you are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, my friend, I know what you want. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kelso, energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you read the designer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Likewise. Good luck, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not worried about my weakening, are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can't do that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf isn't dying and he is not in pain. He could live a long life <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I open that entrance and it's still out there, we're dead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, transfer command to Engineering. Full security alert! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nitrogen oxide. Toxic levels. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When you figure it out, you'll understand command. I'm on myway. I hope I've been able to help. You let me know what you decide? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very strange experience. Puzzling. I still can't comprehend howColonel Richey's vessel could have travelled out that far. Not on it'sown, at any rate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all about you, isn't it? You're the only constant, the onlyperson in both places. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But they wanted us to know they were there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll welcome our visitor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Counsellor, twenty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Waiting for you topull another rabbit out ofyour hat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Likewise, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But I'm afraid we're going to have to find our solution withouthistory's greatest Consulting Detective. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Not only are they closely humanoid, but their historyhas remarkable similarities to ours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Surprised? I don't know what you're talking about. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not accusing you of anything, Mister Uxbridge. The attackingforce spared you for some reason. We'd like to know why. Now, may I goinside? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we know we'll pick up that word the next time through? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't you understand his incredible gift to me? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The bet is ten. That's to you, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you hear an echo? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously there's been some misunderstanding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forty-eight minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Will Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The servo-link must be damaged. We're going to have to gounder the station and access the core directly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you've got to stabilise that tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right then, you talk to me. Where are my officers? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, maybe if you get a little rest and came at this thingfresh. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take five. Throw them away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long until they're fully conscious? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is sufficient evidence. Outposts have beendestroyed. Countless lives have been lost. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, take us away from this pulsar. Heading one eightfive mark three two. Full impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you know my name? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? I didn't kill anybody. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, it's just a game. A little friendly competition, You workup a sweat, you have a few laughs, and you make new friends. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I appreciate it, but that really wouldn't be necessary. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not long enough for an escape, but used as a surprise itmay give a strategic advantage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Telaka was my age, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a large room up ahead called Ten Forward. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all Ican do. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now let's see if we can get this ship to go where we want. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been down there dozens of times. I know my way around. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's your father. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There must be other options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your hurry, Harry? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Romulan craft is a total loss. There'snothing there to salvage unless you want to use tweezers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on the ore and fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know what to do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Correction, Data, I should have said proverbial needle in ahaystack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. Your behaviour has been erratic. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are they responding to our hails, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a Starfleet craft. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the Fleming? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You hate them as much as they hate you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're never going to feel good about this war. None of us will. But we've got to complete our mission. I've been doing a littleresearch, trying to find out about William T Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How concentrated is the activity? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your twenty, one hundred more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what the hell is going on here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Respectfully, if I may suggest regardless of where they camefrom, they are here now and they need our help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Notify Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're on the visitors' list. You didn't know? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want to be in the transporter room to greet her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing will change between us, will it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bought out the Ferengi yet, Ral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then trust me now. Meet to discuss terms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're receiving a message from the SheliakCorporate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They were fast, aggressive, almost vicious. it was more like fighting Klingons than Borg. No offence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Estimated time? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't be so quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot biggerthan yours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, but I'm sure Mister Data knows what he's doing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've heard of the simulation aboard the Hathaway? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Enterprise. This is CounsellorTroi, Lieutenant Yar, Lieutenant La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's nearly as large as the Earth's orbit around the sun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any idea what caused it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. Oh, by the way, you'll need this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How soon do we get underway, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not the first bone I've ever broken. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This structure was apparently made toresemble twentieth century Earth. All efforts to exit have failed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wes? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But the disappearance of Mark Twain, one of the most notedliterary figures of the nineteenth century <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And how long do you think the negotiations will take? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then either way, his memory would have been erased. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Goodnight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rotate shield frequencies. Data, report? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. We're ready to beam over, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The computer still isn't working properly. I can't get a visualof your mother. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby. Walk with me, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us intothe crash. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An adventurer? Aren't you pioneers adventurers at heart? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. Interesting night? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Removed from command, sir. Placed under guard for his actof personal vengeance. Seems there was no profit in it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The odd reading? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everybody stay here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, you've got ten minutes. That's it. If you meet anybody butSarjenka <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, if the computer's programmed to allow Data to transportdown, it would figure that it would allow him to beam back up. Right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, prepare to jettison the module. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Mister Worf, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to have to go down there to find it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry if I <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, this is Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If that's the best they can do, this should last about fiveminutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nor do I, but I know that this silence will injure us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you shut down the entire system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up. You can't tow us. You'd better beam us directly on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I know, but I think it's about time we all sat downtogether and tried to work this out. I have Ambassador Mauric here <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hold no malice toward my benefactors. They could not possibly know the hell they have put me through. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your sanctuary, remember? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to getunderway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold fast. Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there a way to locate those coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any reason she shouldn't feel welcome here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data performs self diagnostic routines on a regular basis. Weshould take a look at his logs. They may reveal something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's our guess. Like a man with no immune system, he wasn'table to handle the overload. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't. I won't. Data's my comrade. We have served together. Inot only respect him, I consider him my friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think it means? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mrs Troi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. Commander <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: End simulation sequence. Secure from drill. Alpha shift, yourresponse time was seven percent slower than the gamma shift. Alldepartments, submit drill evaluation reportsRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any way to detect their self-destruct device? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, it's over ten metres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will explode. But if we stay here, we're dead anyway. Maximumenergy levels, five seconds. See you in a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't real, either. What's happening to me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Duras or Gowron? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll take that risk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May we have better luck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They must have been forced to abandon the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm going with Worf on this one. Let's be careful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aquiel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lavelle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could put out a coded level two query to all Federationoutposts within the perimeter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm willing, Doctor. Although we're not officially part of theEnterprise, I thought there might be something useful we can do whilewe wait. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've discovered the second lab is on the far side of theplanet, completely destroyed. Unable to determine what caused it. Otherwise, very little to clarify the situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need some spreading around money, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your twenty, and fifty more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So he can have a pipe and mug of beer in peace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you have no objections, Doctor Crusher would like to examineyou and your group. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take him to your lab, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's odd? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the devil is that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I refuse to allow this, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But it hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or by me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Astounding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yesterday, I did not know how to eat gagh. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I always hated you for that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Just so you don't harm my son. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, that could have been anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've seen something as fresh and tasty as meat, butinorganically materialised out of patterns used by our transporters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere and I'mready to take it onto the ship. If you would like to take a couple ofdays off, I'll run the interface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kahlest. Who was she? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I'll say this for him. He's sure of himself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you increase phaser power? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had an agreement. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Those are Federation ships. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, hear me! Look around you, the Ferengiare using their thought devices on you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got a problem. Our core fragment isgoing to pass by Moab Four in six days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And yet all sensors are operating properly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was walking along minding my own business, doing a simplegeological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Admiral. Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? This trip to Starbase Five One Five israther unexpected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wasn't playing Parrises Squares. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it was my fault. I got distracted at a crucial moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As expected. Mister Data, Mister Worf, proceed as wediscussed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know how I would feel if the situation were reversed, if theywere in our territory holding a Federation citizen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have no right to be there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the food station. You can reach methrough the comm. panel. Later, we'd like to ask you a few morequestions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything we can do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll circuit in auxiliary power to the Bridge. Somehow we'llsilence Sousa if he decides to play an encore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you understood any part of what he's tried to tell you? Humanity is no longer a savage race. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories aboutAldea, thewondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman ofXerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needsfor all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to artand culture. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Easier? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mind a visitor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Investigating some things that I've noticed since I've beenhere. The last was a piece of fruit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going try to access their main computer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you determine which of the comm. links is connected to thePrime Minister's office? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I see. I have no choice but to agree. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was caught in the riots when the police moved in. It's thelast thing I remember. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarianblood feuds, and I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemieswere. How could this virus have been transmitted, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A shuttlecraft? How's that possible? I thought we were the onlymanned Federation vessel out here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I might, if we weren't on our way to help some suffering anddying humans who Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying that Worf is spraying this <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something else. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to half impulse, and take us into orbit above the thirdplanet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can't we block them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'm looking forward to proving my innocence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Current position? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It does appear to be Federation issue. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your name is Mavek. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Scotty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I might have said RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The hell there isn't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is our e. t. a. at Pacifica, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about freedom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? Because I'm only a man? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Know some blues? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're right, I won't. But I'm going to find out what's real andwhat's not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I want you to look over the medical records from all therescue vessels that responded to the Khitomer massacre. See if there'sany information on the aftermath that might help us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you open it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How much longer do we have? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay. Everyone's still trying tofigure out exactly how you did it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Fleming's last contact with Starfleetwas four days ago. According to them, there was nothing out of theordinary when they entered the Corridor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Miss Henshaw. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The unknown vessel has been destroyed. The Uxbridges have beendestroyed. There's no reason for the Enterprise to remain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, arm the photon torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is the nature of your mission? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, locate Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gul Evek wants to meet with you to discuss the situation onthe surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A hot milk toddy? You're kidding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could use our phasers as a scalpel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're the key to all this, aren't you? Who are you? Who areyou? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Frightening, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I told you, they're here to help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Mister Datais coordinating the salvage efforts now. Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's older than the comet itself. Could someone from theD'Arsay system have built it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything willreturn to <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you at least show us a way into the compound? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You wanted to see me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To make us believe she had died as a result of the malfunction' <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's about Lieutenant Commander Daren. As a department head, shecomes to me for systems allocation, personnel transfers, things likethat. I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable with her requests. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ishara! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or use one of their sleeves, I don't care. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're new around here, aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's a Starfleet officer. She's my responsibility. Your peoplehave terms. We're willing to listen. We want her back. It's as simpleas that. I don't think it's necessary to detain this gentleman anylonger. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just met with the Captain about your mission recommendation. Iwould appreciate it if next time you came to me first. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As First Officer, I should be informed. I should know everythingthat you know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He cleared the Iconian programme from his own system. How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At your age? You could break your neck! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently some time last night. That's why I wanted to talk toyou. You may have been the last person to see her. Did you go with herinto her quarters? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't look natural. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you feel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not in a position to dictate to anybody. She attacked twoFederation officers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Probably. This may take some time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you honestly get the impression they could handle ourtechnical specifications? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the gamma ray scanner? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get him out of here. Confine them both to their quarters. Put aguard on their door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. Excuse me. I need to speak to her alone fora moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had three security teams search deck seven. They couldn'tfind anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I said I wouldn't mind the assignment, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher and her assistants are waiting in Transporterroom three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Mister Data, get us back online. Geordi, try boosting the power to the LU bands. McKnight, increase thedistance between the Enterprise and the shuttle. We're going to needsome more room to make manual adjustments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Daren has already requested extra time on the mainsensor array. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've been able to determine, you andyour wife and this house are all that survived that attack. That's waseither a bizarre coincidence or by design, and I don't favour thecoincidence theory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I suggest we move to a safer location. It couldreappear at any moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only way we knew we'd come out of warp was by looking out awindow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what boarded the station could have been an organism thatlooked and acted like Lieutenant Rocha? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that any less reasonable than being magically transformed toanother place by the Picard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with theRomulans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. I'll catch up with you later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll alert the crew. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the Zakdornian word for mismatch? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, please. Leave me alone! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you see that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can count on all of us, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How soon before the process is in place? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set course for Styris Four, warp three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. If you'llturn over the inoperative part to Commander Data, we can begin repairs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, we won't go back! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe they should, Data. Maybe if we felt the loss of any lifeas keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, human historywould be a lot less bloody. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could his death have left some sort of empathic echo? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, but they knew who their enemy was better than we do. Theymay have known what caused the trouble. They just didn't know how toget out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three and six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd like to think so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you think of any reason a saboteur would choose tricyanate? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think we could adapt the cloak for the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starfleet does. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase to warp six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am Commander William Riker of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, that's where the emitters come in. We shoot out a seriesof photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears. From that we should get a fairly complete outline. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll think about it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Some kind of corrosion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Since you've fulfilled your agreement, Captain, can we nowbeam the vaccine aboard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computergenerated fantasy I once experienced on another holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude. I'msurprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been offered my own command. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure he'll be thrilled to know there are two of us now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was she doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Seeing the look on his face. I'll get you another drink. Two more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It appears, then disappears, then reappears. No predictablepattern, no sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we do this, we have to do it fast the Romulans will be withinsensor range in less than a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Garrett? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hang on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, if she was married to me, she had to be patient. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Radiation danger? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated. I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'mnot insane. And there isn't any. There isn't. There's nothing. 'm sorry. Could we go back to 'you're becoming agitated'? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Have you got a flush or a full house? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well. I'm glad I ran into the two of you. When you have nomemory of who you are, or who anybody else is, you find yourself RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I think we can make an exception in this case. Vash is aguest of the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Countess. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think eitherof these phenomena could produce enough of them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, you know why. I don't belong here. I have to get back onmy ship, in space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess the trip Pacifica will have to wait. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If he's dangerous. If. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I got out with the last of the colonists. Ifit hadn't been for the perimeter teams, none of us would have made it. We were able to clear out four of the teams, and the interferenceprevented us from getting two more. I don't know how they could havesurvived. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They know each other. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll start tomorrow morning, oh eight hundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, who programmed the new coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll come back during the third window, We'll bring a new EPScoupling and try to access the core from another console up here. Rikerto Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty ninewho know nothing about it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She was working, but she said she would be Speak ofthe devil. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, you're familiar with this star system. You'll takethe conn. Is there a problem, Ensign? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you're just the person I need to talk to, clear somethingup. It's my understanding that one of the duties of the First Officerof a Klingon ship is to assassinate his Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing yet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All stop, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Those are my orders, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lunch. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your point of view, not mine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Five or six weeks. + <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It would help to accelerate the process. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where did you get it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you see Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is another change in the Borg behaviour. They left theirdead instead of vapourising them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was all that about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The shuttle doesn't have warp capability. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was on the Bridge. The ship was at yellow alert. We wererunning some tests on the engines. Something went wrong. There was anexplosion in Engineering. Heavy casualties. In the midst of thiscrisis, the First Officer, the Chief of Engineering and most of Bridgecrew mutinied against Captain Pressman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement, you've got agift for understatement. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dan, no! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that someone I should know of? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It fits their historical pattern. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Verify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The last I knew, Commander Daren was on team six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Step away from him, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We came a long way to get him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. All science stations, stand by. We're about tolight up the nebula. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Counsellor Troi. Your mother's just come aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: According to Hayne, the Coalition and theAlliance raid each other for supplies, much of it non-essential. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a Klingon delicacy. Pipius claw. This is heart of targ. This, of course, is gagh. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm just a little dizzy. I'll be fine. I just need to liedown. PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll let them know they can have more access to the lateralsensor grid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, thank you. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, withdraw the Enterprise. That's an order. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. Don't want to come up short. You are keeping count? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There you go. A little something for you, Ziggy. A littlesomething for those cocktail waitresses. Why don't you run thisoutside, give it to the parking lot attendants. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how far and how fast can that transport ship travel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was never the Romulans. It was you allalong, wasn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Someone restrain the Captain! First Officer's log, supplemental. More than anhour has passed since the Captain beamed out, energy only. Every efforthas been made to determine his whereabouts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe wecould consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediateproblem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have to admit I had a feeling you were different. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even if it involves my father. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what the hell happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The European Hegemony? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One photon torpedo ought to do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll bring her home, Wes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's causing it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Seems to be exactly what's happening atthis hotel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Got it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prove it. Return our man to us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Precisely, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, if we project our course beyond the rendezvouscoordinates, what lies ahead? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but without his help, I'm not sure we'll be able to poseany intelligent questions, let alone come up with any solutions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now we know what triggered the SOS. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Definitely. Keep me posted? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've reached the designated coordinates,but the M-class planet, it's gone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any way to extrapolate am origin? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've practised in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing. Here's your hundred and twenty more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's late. I am tired. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you became a member of their crew? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How's Lieutenant Suna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Crystalline Entity paid us a visit. We lost two colonists,but we got the rest in here. Captain's log, stardate 45122.3. We have notifiedStarfleet Command of our intention to pursue and investigate theCrystalline Entity. To that end, we have been joined by Doctor KilaMarr, a xenologist who has made studying the Entity her life's work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I might. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you seeing anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, Riker. This is turning outto be a very long tunnel or corridor, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it's artificial, then we're talking about sabotage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Check with the Enterprise, see what's available. Be sure yourconcern are addressed before we install it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it's any comfort, we're all in the same situation, so stayput for now. We'll be back in touch. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're jumpy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's more power than our entire ship can generate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Spooky. Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great story. I'll remember it next time I'm in a knife fight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ferengi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't believe me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They may be here to help you. Don't be a fool! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: P for Picard! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know of the simulation. What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're going to make a break for it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He will have to come with us now, Endar. It is up to Starfleetto decide the consequences. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something jabbed me here in the calf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's right. If we could position the shuttlecraft far enough infront of the Enterprise, it could detect the pockets and allow usenough time to manoeuvre out of the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, tell me about noranium. It vaporises at? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if hecan start dating his sister. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe Doctor Crusher can treat you and bring you back to the wayyou were. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up untilthis moment I had the luxury of time, but now I've got to make achoice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let youstart these experiments again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it iswrong today. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Charming fellow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're entering the Legaran system, sir. Shall I have Mister Worf contact their ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm listening. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut offbefore we could find out what was wrong. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They seem normal enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be. Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chanceor intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out ofnowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very nice. I'd better get back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get away from her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, run comparison of known phenomena. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Vulcans haven't figure out what these fragments are butthey've determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare a scanner probe. Let's see what's in there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or if they need to recharge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the damage to thereactor is greater than the Tagrans led us to believe. The fieldmodulator is installed and operational, but it's not going to beenough. The reactor has already gone into overload. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And there he sits, and he watches us struggle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're running out of options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Those events did happen, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Kelso? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There was an emergency reported in TenForward. Mister Worf's on his way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're ten years older. A man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So who have you got so far? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When we brought the shuttle and the other Picard on board, wecommitted to a sequence of events which may be unalterable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Connecting two points through subspace? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right away, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll go get her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here, Captain. We made itRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have visual contact. I don't recognise it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand this. Everyone is protecting Sarek. His wife,Mendrossen, even you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let go! One of us has to get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course, Ensign. Full impulse. Riker to Transporter roomone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a real maze down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You just can't stay away from the big chair, can you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you take the engines offline? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I should apologise, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We found the reason for the geologicalinstability. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we transport him out of there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence thismorning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusualgoing on in the Devron system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three. please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The storm is going to interfere with communications. Everythingwill need to be coordinated from the surface. Mister Data, you willcoordinate the evacuation of the colonists. Doctor, they have ninepatients in the outpost infirmary. Your first priority will be to getthem to Sickbay. After that you will stay on board the Enterprise, beready to receive casualties. Marquez, you will take some people downand track the storm. All the other teams will need to be kept apprisedof its heading. Commander, you're in charge of deploying thedeflectors. Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I can handle that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you also familiar with the terms I agreed to keep you boyson the Enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Compliments of the Enterprise. It's called an Albenimeditation crystal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I can handle that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well that eliminates the possibility of fate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's the nearest one to our last position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The debate is still going on in some quarters, but I think so,yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. I'll send those vouchers to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said I was terrified. Of what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope you'll be as thoughtful when the time comes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need you to send us your shuttlecraft Curie. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Curious isn't exactly how I'd describe it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. I'm glad you came. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Trent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually, they think highly of us, Tasha. We have a quality ofgrowth which they admire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it makes you feel any better, you're not alone. CaptainJellico has made major changes in every department on the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, has Counsellor Troi beamed up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, starship Enterprise. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any guess how long we'll have? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If this is a knife, what happened to Mavek? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready for duty, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Primary attitude control has failed. Going to secondary systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, but I think that you will. One way or another, it's going tocome down to you and me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. I get the idea. Captain, we are approachingDytallix B. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something straightforward, like disarm yourweapons systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? We're not at all alike. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, Amanda. You are so beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't sound like you care for that option. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible. It's planned month by month, decade by decade? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reprogramming them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not Minuet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare tofire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a good thing one of these pockets didn't pass through aphoton torpedo casing or the matter-antimatter containment pods. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: His saddle? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard evasive manoeuvre. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our apologies, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are we dealing with here? Are thesecreatures feeding on us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. He's a friend of Doctor Crusher's. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Those aren't muskets. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us to fifteen thousand metres, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Prime Directive doesn't apply. They're human. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I speak with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Okona seems to have excellent vision as well as a healthylibido. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm just afraid of the big chair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's delicious. The pipius claw was excellent. I also enjoyedthis Bregit lungs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None. Why would they do that? We're allies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, other than a question about the Ares's First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the file. It'll work now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She seemed very sure that she was making theright choice. I think her only real regret was that she let you down. Here's my report. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: We should also see if there's some way that we can neutralisetheir forcefields. We've got to let them know that we can adapt too,Mister Worf. We're no longer just fighting the Borg, we're fighting thelife experience they've stolen from Captain Picard. Now how the hell dowe defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deck nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you give us an idea of its heading? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if I produced evidence that Captain Picard's log entry wasfalsified to indicate that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got to find a way to track him. What about thehigh-resolution EM scans? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. If you believe those accusations, then you certainly shouldact on them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well there ought to be. Computer, discontinue programme anderase. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wes, come in please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't see Doctor Apgar until the following morning when heasked to see me alone. Commander La Forge returned to the Enterprise. Resume programme. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, there was a restraint. It was flat and metal. It was madeof metal. it came down over my legs. No, no, it was across my chest,right here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did this ever get started? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data! Carmen! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is a knockout like you doing in acomputer generated gin joint like this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting they be transferred tothe Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you askedfor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not directly. Board of inquiry blamed Darson for carelessnessabout Ghorusdan cultural taboos. But if Elbrun was so good, why didn'the warn Darson? What was he doing there if he couldn't sense that muchhostility? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Memory loss? What are you talking about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring us in closer, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't see any material in here that could handle that muchcurrent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We didn't anticipate that somebody would be living there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise aman like Rice would have reported again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Somehow I don't think they'll let us beam over there and askthem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. Quark. I see you remember me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How soon before the deflector's ready? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint the source of the Borgtransmission? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange an away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What makes you say that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Course laid in for Durenia Four, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. How did that feel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak have not attempted to communicate with theFederation for a hundred and eleven years. Why are they doing it now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The positive side of that is the information they have about usis also out of date. Captain, I think it's that lack of informationthat this is all about. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to transporter room three. Prepare to beam Ensign Kellerout of the engine room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was as if he was blaming me for something. This wasn't theonly incident. The last several days, I've felt like everybody'sstaring at me or talking about me. It's as if I was in Frame of Mind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll see about getting main power back online. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? Data, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coordinates set? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, Mister Worf? I have a special mission for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The dead one, I'm afraid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean to tell me all these people belongto the Ansata? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very good. Very good indeed. Now I'll need someone to play with. A trio. Piano, bass and drums, and a 'bone for me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We found this type two phaser in yourshuttlecraft. It was taken from the weapons locker on the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. I was just held up for a while. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Finished, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's going to be a hell of a gymnast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, serpent worms. Would you like some? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'd better take a look. What kind of vessel is she? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when this crew is revived? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then maybe you should consider this. If anything happens tothem, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation, which means morestarships will be coming to Kesprytt and those ships are going to wantanswers which puts your country under a very large and veryuncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when wecontacted just one of your people without authorisation? Well, justthink of what it'll be like. Ten starships asking questions, contactinghundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even startsending down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find mymissing officers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Block their transporter with the shields! Extend to maximumrange! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why don't we get this over with? I'll call your three, and I'llraise you anything you've got left. Well? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are there any others? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A Dyson Sphere? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell is going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything you'd like to talk about, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do we know the source of their transporter beam? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is new to me as well. Please, don't go. We've got to talkabout this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, thank you for coming. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To smash your house of cards? No. It was the visual record of mywife, Minuet. Bad move. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not supposed to happen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if we don't remove them, the Sheliak will. Forcefully. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think anybody ever is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fajo doesn't know that we're onto him, so he probably isn'ttaxing his engines at top speed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Taris, if you've got phaser capability, prepare use them now! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't need your fantasy women. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd be more comfortable if you'd monitor our progress from theBridge, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security teams, stand by. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's got to be a ventilation source somewhere. We need somelight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and just leave it atthat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Marquez has already set up on thesurface. Apparently the storm is still gaining speed. He's estimating <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriateemotion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet. Why, are you interested? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, with that holodeck we just saw. I think I could conjure upan interestingprogramme or two. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry I missed it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, you just asked me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only way to find out is to go back down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you explain why they're pulling us along with them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what is taking so long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have spend about five minutes greeting the Iyaarans maybe anhour making small talk at this reception. I'm the one who has to escortthem around the ship for the next three days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's just a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise'll beback tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's been a cave-in in one of the magma pockets. You'reneeded in transporter room two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It appears we will have some time before reaching Braslota. Iwas wondering if you'd agree to play me in a game of Strategema. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Rightnow, your duty's here on the Bridge. TROI <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. You've been declared dead. You can't give ordersaround here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is CaptainWilliam Riker of the Klingon vessel, Pagh. I order you to lower yourshields and surrender. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, this is what we came here for. Captain, we're entering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you playing or not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: By all means. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'm not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open a channel, Mister Worf, and prepare tofire at target one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who do you need sanctuary from? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's wrong, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring her round to two seven five mark three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So much for the cease fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They are that, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're certain they'll negotiate? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A positronic brain. He promised so much. And then when he failedcompletely, Doctor Soong disappeared. Now we know he went somewhereelse to try a second time. Data, Geordi, we'll get a close look at thislab. You and Lieutenant Worf reconnoitre where these corridors lead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An android. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like they had a battle with time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Hickman? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, shut off the music! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're sounding like a private eye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, any progress identifying the probe? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The first long range reading. Magnificationten to the sixth. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm going to have to leave for a while to see to my duties. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought the Tarellians were all dead What are the poor devilsdoing here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I remember studying his career in school. The treaty of Alpha Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission to theFederation, the Klingon Alliance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nope. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someonetaking a shower in his or her clothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I take it the mind-meld was a success? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you alright? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I gave you a direct order, Mister Data. Yourelease that transporter lockout now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go to impulse. Back us off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right behind that door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't really match the outfit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Doctor showed it to me, too. Rather harmless-looking thing,I thought. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. We killed them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're with me, Lieutenant. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Miridian six? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought thatwas uninhabited. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The image of Rice has been replaced by something which ishovering several metres away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was just one hell of a storm. It moved in on our positionfaster than anything I've ever seen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another ship from Atlec? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Two kilometres north of the away team's beam-down point. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If Worf's right, then our arrival would be an uncomfortablereminder of the facts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive,Sir. I would like to make one suggestion, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, these things happen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any luck contacting Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever's blocking our scanners willprevent the use of the transporters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Am I disturbing you?  WORF <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He has been injured. I am in command now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Under the terms of the Selonis Convention, Captain Picard must <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd be a fool to turn that promotion down, wouldn't I? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Slow down. I lost you back there. Which sensorclusters? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What can I do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could the same treatment work for us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ventilation and life support are failing at random spots allover the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jason's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. It's not true. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did any of them know why they'd the response? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we even knew where to send it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's the kind of a test that you'll have to take again if youwant to be a Bridge Officer. Only next time, the problem won't be soeasy, so I suggest you study up on your emergency procedures. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, stay together! Stay together! This way! This way! This way! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll discuss it later, Mister Data. Doctor, you're coming withus, too. You need to get to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're Betazoid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like hell! You're a damn thief! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And these get put into the large containment unit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At least, sir, all the department heads have reported the damagerepaired. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, deactivate all command functions. Authorisation, RikerOmega Three <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My cards are getting cold. Here you go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought they were supposed to be back online yesterday. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander William Riker of the Enterprise. Identifyyourself. I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot. Identifyyourself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Delicious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess we'll have to take that chance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened back there, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was that called? Mister Worf's a very good teacher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell them we have an emergency situation. We'll begin a searchas soon as we've completed that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Adjust target coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I find them very much as we were a several hundred years ago,but possessing the technology they have now, they're very dangerous . <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An appointment? No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I see. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what is bothering you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did we know? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew evaluation reports? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cancel Red alert. Mister Worf, take the weapons offline. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Wes? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Join me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think itis, it's actually worse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reliable, steady, punctual. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Suna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the crystal thing has begun to move away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're still waiting for us to make up our minds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can arrange for a tour of the ship, if you'd like. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse theimpact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set sub-warp speed for towing, LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What good would that do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs. Uhnari could havebeen responsible for them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds like my superintendent. When I was at the Academy, we hada Vulcan Superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of everysingle cadet. He knew everything about them. It was like having yourparents around all the time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess we're fortunate you had any at all, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Surgery. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ishara? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, who's his mother? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure, sir. Are we alone out here, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rationale? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Code one alpha zero. Ship in distress. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It never occurred to me. This is what I am. Did you ever tell methat you are only a single being? Of course not. That was normal toyou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you give us enough power to get us out of here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Recommendations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deck fifteen, a few decks below the shuttlebay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, he was joking. You know that, right? Data? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Data, get that beam back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was she like? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see it, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The life signs seem to be coming fromthe far side of Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Impeccable timing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The particles are being routed through the transporter systeminto cargo bay five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all right. Take it easy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to theship. I cannot let any Bridge Officer serve who's not qualified. I'msorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why does the scanner read her as a human? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no evidence either way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Return fire, Mister Worf. Full phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, we need a diversion, now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That sounds like the next logical step. Start with the mostcrucial areas. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, you're absolutely sure? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At warp six, we should be there in just over sixteen hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll pass that along to the crew, Captain. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Mister Dokaychin? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what's causing it to move? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have all the time you need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drawing on the log record of the construction of the prototypeandroid Lore, also constructed by Noonien Soong, I request to beallowed to remove the Commander's hand for your inspection. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now you do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who's in charge here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lotmore than she bargained for. Maintain Red Alert. Try to keep thoseshields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually, he and I have been able to patch a few things up. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jazz. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In about a week. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everybody up here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that what you want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did you find? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just had a feeling. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on Data, we'd better get down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where will I find Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had twelve years to think about it, and if I had it to doover again I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at youinstead of them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I agree, Captain. They have not responded. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it.  CRUSHER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't move! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If he's been influenced by an alien, wouldn't that put us all atrisk? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's not much to look at. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There was nothing provocative about what she did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give me that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're out-manned, you're out-gunned, you're out-equipped. Whatelse have you got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any of them inhabited? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cease fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He seems to be handling this quite well, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? That's the last thing I expected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want to take any unnecessary chances. If they get intotrouble, beam them up immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hang on, I'm coming. Enterprise, lock usonto her signal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I might be interested, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And we'd be able to see for ourselves. Let's do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you got a lock on that other ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Historical. That's it. I remember I was reading a history of allthe past starships named Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or that you might think that was a line. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Be ready to increase power in case we needit. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, it's better than music, it's jazz. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever that alien probe did to him,Barclay now seems to know more about the internal workings of theEnterprise than anyone else on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Freeze programme. Then I returned to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker. Our emergency teams are on boardyour ship. Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we have no facts. We have to assume theexplosion was an accident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A phone call? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, lay in a course to the nearest Starbase. Warp six. Captain's log, stardate 46001.3. Everyone whoshould be in the nineteenth century is safely there, and those whoshould be in the twenty fourth are here. Mister Data has been restoredto us, head and all, and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was tohave written after our encounter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what about the computer's recreational data base? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm leading an away team over there to get the Captain back. We'll find a way to bring them out of warp. Ensign Crusher, youcontinue to assist Mister La Forge. Commander Shelby, you'll take theBridge and coordinate with Starfleet. Data, Worf, Doctor, you're withme. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would still feel better if they could rendezvous with youroperatives in a less public place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pursuit? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was being polite. I could've won in twenty moves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, could a human host carry him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you direct any more power to the shields? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't make this too easy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. The briefing mentions something about an uncanny linguisticskill. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever it is you're doing out there,you've got to stop it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're sure? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, beam La Forge backimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If the ship's records have been tampered with, then transporterrecords could have been changed as well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had an appointment. We were going to discuss <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She may not be the only one. The science teams that went down tothe surface fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were morethan curious about what's outside their world. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Begin firing sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is my sister. She's angry. She's got a vicious temper. Iwouldn't cross her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're the closest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In your position, it's important to ask yourself one question. What would Picard do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Including you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The power boost to the structural integrity field protected thenacelles. We used the inertial dampers to simulate complete shieldfailure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You call this healthy? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Absolutely. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Repair teams to Engineering. Seal hull breach. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One propeller, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. Ensign, take us in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Scan the sector. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap medown, inject me with drugs and call it a treatment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. I'll do what I can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all youroptions, you tried every alternative, and then you made the hardchoice. Come on, let's get out of here, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I join you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could some kind of damping field have caused us to losevelocity? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best to make a good impression, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've already assigned them to the away team. And I'll be withyou as well, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, you know if you do that in Parrises Squares you lose therhythm of the game. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can see why your father wants to marry you off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprisematerial. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell are they doing in a Federation sector? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can't pilot a shuttle you're not familiar with. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to befine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, Counsellor Troi has recommended the examinations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A pleasure, Mrs. Manheim. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's completely intact. There's less than point zero zero threepercent signal degradation. How is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Main viewer on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're still looking at a corebreach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could be he's planning to enter shuttlebay two from outside theEnterprise, bypassing the security guards. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Completely irrelevant. These people are professionals. Ifthere's a personality conflict, you're in charge, you settle it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lucky him. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There it is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Almost as much as I had to learn when I came aboard as CaptainPicard's first officer. A fact he reminded me of when I commented onwhat a pain in the neck you are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You seem a little vague on the specifics. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, target two hundred metres belowthe apex of the particle stream. Feed the coordinates to transporterroom two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Point five four parsecs from our original position. Almost aday's travel in just thirty seconds? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's still headed for the Brechtian Cluster. We'vere-established our course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it wasn't made of wood. It was smoother, more metallic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir, it is. But as they say, sir, you're the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is primarily a diplomatic mission. The Jaradan arestrategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts havefailed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in thepronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty year rift. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, you've made your point. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, of course. And these rocks and vegetation have much simplerpatterns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a tribute to your people that you were able to recover sorapidly from the Tarsian War. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take it. You always had the better hand, in everything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bynars seem perfect for this. Eventhough this is the first time I've ever come in contact with them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien, stand by for transport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Analysis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer. Display family record. Riker. William T. Limit tovisual. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're running out of time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll see, Counsellor. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever you do, do it quickly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enjoy your dinner. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I don't get the command computer back online soon, none ofthis, whatever this is, won't matter. We'll all be dead. Captain's log, supplemental. It is no longer aninconvenient, childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victimof the Tsiolkovsky infection, is now in control of my starship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're out. We got through. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your knowledge of Klingon curses is impressive. But as a Romulanmight say, only a veruul would use such language in public. MisterWorf, please see to the security arrangements for our guest's stay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've been intercepted by the Klingon vesselBortas. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, those are two of your friends out there. They have savedyour life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd bewilling to sacrifice them like this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You should be getting somethingRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which one of them is real? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't believe these simulations could be this real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A couple of cracked ribs. She'll be all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's senseless for this stranger to be held captive. All thistalk of the Overseer, it's old superstitions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isolation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll get right on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The engine's been off a little over threehours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course, Captain Kargan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The computer should think all three of us are Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try again! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which suggests that he wasn't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And we were going to meet on Risa, six weeks later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Was that an invitation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You will be careful, sir <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The joke is you. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lower your shield! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First Officer to First Officer, Kazago, if your Captain Bok knewabout this, then why this peaceful meeting to present us with theStargazer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Palmer is missing. A scan of the planet shows Mintakan lifeforms only, no humans. However <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope your profit margin's pretty high forthis little adventure, because you're risking war with the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She knows her stuff. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, neither am I. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No indication of a base at all? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Protocol. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is she, Q? You can forget your game if Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it's a very special day. I thought the father of the bridewould enjoy being relieved early on the wedding day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I should never have made that agreement withyou. I could have saved that child. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me. I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may beable to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate thebrain, speed the healing. In fact, I think you did that for me once,when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear afriendly voice, even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've beenbusy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusualthing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else? Ifinished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check itout when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long. <eos>
