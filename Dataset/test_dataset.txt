<bos> PICARD: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The boy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Theorise. What could have caused such a catastrophicmalfunction? <eos> <bos> PICARD: At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Oh, one thing, Number One. Starfleet will benotifying Carmen Davila's family of her death and returning herpersonal effects. Would you care to enclose a letter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Under whose command in this sector? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Survivors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We were friends, nothing more. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Sutherland. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I should be getting down to the planet. Commander Rikerwill be available here to show you anything that you want to see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An impostor running my ship. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: An entire civilisation that's terminally ill. Is it reversible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they pursuing us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you'd care to explain why we're here, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of cargo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Walker, what is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't get out of character, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought you might find this interesting, Mister Crusher. Fewhumans have ever seen an Antedean in the flesh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are we within sensor range? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He'll never lose that respect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some problem, Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You claim you visited this planet a thousand years ago andnegotiated a contract? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that's it? No other comment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you object to giving them enough for their own immediateneeds? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On many worlds we've been to, they are isolated, treated aspariahs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? How so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll be waiting here to pick you up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A Romulan device. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell is she doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine. Destroy yourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or a lover, perhaps? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I knew. Q first became interested in him at Farpoint. Ihave no idea what it means. Meanwhile, we must proceed with our rescuemission. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there any other ships in the vicinity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. If this works, we may not have much time to preventthe power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely where to be and whatto do the very instant that time begins to move backwards. Captain's log, supplemental. After placing themodified tricorder on the Romulan ship, we have returned to theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the second time that you have shown surprise at myappearance, Kevin. The first time was understandable, but now? Unlessit is because you never expected to see me again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can scarcely believe it myself, but I am so grateful for yourpresence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, the situation is under control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're injured. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I think she has a right to know that before she makes achoice about her future. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Bringloidi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's why they're asking for you. Not for your militaryproficiency, but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They won't protect you any longer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Then we can continue our mission without significantinterruption. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Notify all sections we'll be leaving this area in one hour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about thoseroots. How did you know their medicinal values? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately the results would not be available for severaldays, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed he has. Would you look into it, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard theEnterprise again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, stow that with the medical supplies. Keep youreye on it. All right, we're going to explore the cave. Mister Crusher,look for any signs of water, no matter how faint. Captain Dirgo, willyou lead the way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I didn't give you enough credit. Continue thesimulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The priority is to find out who or what is doing this. NumberOne, the Bridge, such as it is, is yours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you honestly believe youhave sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amanda, what Q is asking is have you ever deliberately usedyour abilities? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. This is Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise,representing the United Federation of Planets. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope that's true, Mister Data. Nevertheless, thisinvestigation began with your death. I am simply trying to see that itdoesn't end that way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of co-ordinatesnear Romulus and to bring us back, and that is all I am prepared todiscuss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. The three of you will remain as needed to assistDoctor Crusher. RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about that comm. panel? You said you damaged it when youwere cutting it out of the shuttle. Did you? You see, I find it hard tobelieve that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that couldget you out of here after seven years. And what was this really for? Tokeep me immobilised? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And may this union be a productive one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief O'Brien, has served with Benjamin Maxwell. Ithought that he might be able to provide some insights. Mister O'Brien, I understand that Captain Maxwell lost his familyduring a raid on an outpost. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't trust you, Q. Why should I expect Amanda to? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a difficult choice. You must do what you think best, Data. But whatever decision you make, we will support it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you've been planning this so long, youmust have a way of getting off the Enterprise and leaving this system. I think you have a ship coming for you. I plan to be on it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This will be the test. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister Data, we're reading <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this a personal matter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we still beam the affected sections out into space? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant, myself most of all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, come on. This is a routine procedure. Quite commonplace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whether we approve of the Zalkonians' intentions is not theissue. But for what it's worth, I believe John is correct that hisexistence has broader ramifications than that of a simple criminal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's a lady, all right, and her name is Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Structural status, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My ship is in danger. It is imperative that I regainnavigational control. I want you to persuade Professor Moriarty toreturn the voice command to me, or I will not modify the transporter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not him I'm inclined to judge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Specify, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, Doctor Crusher's become concerned that yourparacortical readings have become erratic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't thinkyou'll find one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not going to get away with it this time. Picard toEngineering. Transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulseengines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I felt guilty before he died> Having feelings like thatfor my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, Ipromised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It wouldbe like betraying my friend <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure she is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It has been accomplished before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Denied. When we get another window in the storms. The crashsite? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Therefore you see this armed raid as the only option. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you aseismologist? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceedin our own way. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, let me see the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then our business with you is concluded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should have notified the Federation authorities. To concealhim was a clear violation of our agreement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good luck, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that intended as a threat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But without me you are not complete. I know you so well. Youlive for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter,pursuing me, forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What went wrong, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that is so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Inform Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Yes, you do, somewhat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did she not even pick up one piece of trash? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate warp shell! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect meto forget a lifetime spent there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds like animals. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The weapons conversion, Lieutenant Burke? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, why not go out and take a closer look. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For now, Hayne's Coalition is our only safe access to thecolony. We'll keep the door open, see where it leads us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There, that's much better. Now, do you want to try it again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, could I speak with you in my Ready room? You havethe Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This has been a strain on our friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So the only way out is by the transporter. Or the dimensionaljump. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our next assignment is on this heading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You could say that. I've been invited to the annual StarfleetAdmiral's banquet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you willservice us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing so grandiose. Just this. Cooperation. There was anintent here. Whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than eitherof us. Let's collaborate. Let's share whatever we learn about what hashappened here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My dear Doctor, in our current position, when that starexplodes, you'll get to watch your experiment from the inside out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What configuration? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I want you to put a stitch in time and, er, save muchmore than nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it so important that you to win one last argument? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The play? A Midsummer Night's Dream. We have performed inLondon, Paris, Milan. Milan. To sold out houses. I assure you, you willhave the rent, in full, with a bonus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Phaser. A sphere. Bok used it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way to Engineering. Join me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate sensor sweeps. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're saying I should just sit down, shut up and wait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You copy, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are the only living thing that really exists on Rana. Andthough you look human, you're not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your security status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll agree that this is a fairly routine mapping mission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, would you enlighten us? What is required forsentience? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, I am never critical of any member ofmy staff being curious, but it's just that the timing is so <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I'd be delighted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is the Ambassador? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, we have no reason to rule out anything. We are notordered to investigate the origins of our guest, nor tell anyone whatthey should believe. We are simply to transport Kahless to the HomeWorld. And while he's here with us, he will be treated as an honouredguest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have returned in order to give me this message? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I'll lead it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course he's innocent. But as a Starfleet Captain, I can'tallow myself the luxury of yielding to my personal feelings. Theevidence warrants a trial. I'll have to allow extradition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I shall busy making arrangements for the conference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't see anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Override. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, this is unusual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have they estimated time for repairs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold present course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll try and keep them occupied until you arrive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I knew that I could count on you. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: In revenge, there never is. Let the dead rest. And the pastremain the past. Enterprise, lock on. Beam me home, Riker. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Who was the traitor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Orton. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, Doctor, I have been more than fair. I have doneeverything I can to substantiateyour, your perceptions of a <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's alright, Mister Worf. I think, for now, circumstanceswarrant caution, nothing more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of theplanet's surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. So how we respond to a game tells you more about us thanour real life, this tale told by an idiot? Interesting, Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You really believe I would leave you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bitvague from the moment just before you abandoned ship. Is there anythingthat you can add to the official account? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. So let's continue on course. Somewhere out theresomething will happen. A decision will be made during the course ofwhich, I will be separated from the Enterprise. At the time, thedecision will seem to be correct, but it won't be. We have toanticipate and not make, not make the same mistake once. Something iswaiting for us out there. Let's try and determine what it is, asquickly as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So that you can wake with the dawn and begin the hunt again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your next priority will be to retrieve any information you canabout this ship's mission. Contact the OperationsOfficer to assist you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment, Captain. Captain Endar, last night Jono attacked mewith a dagger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are moving to intercept. Maintain your course and power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You echo another noteworthy commander in a similarcircumstances, Number One. A countryman of yours, George ArmstrongCuster when his Seventh Cavalry arrived at the Little Big Horn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is this possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The final game against Minsk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll inform Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very shortly, anywhere will be preferable to this room. MisterWorf, I am depending on you. You must get Data back to the Enterprise. He may be their only hope. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That may not be entirely true, Professor. This which we callthe holodeck uses a principle similar to another device called atransporter. In the year in which we live, humans have discovered thatenergy and matter are interchangeable. In the holodeck, energy isconverted to matter. Thus you have substance. But only here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it's your decision, Chancellor. But I must say, I regretthat I won't have the opportunity of knowing your people better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Weapons report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd rather just observe, if you don't mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, am I interrupting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: About time. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The fact is, I wasn't expecting this setting. I had assumedthat my senior Bridge officers would be attending. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, will you send another probe to the T-taurisystem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy at the moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If this is going to work, these people will need your strength,your guidance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Which creates a very difficult problem for theEnterprise. Our treaty requires us to protect Haven, and Federationpolicy requires that we assist life forms in need, which must includethe Tarellians. I'll want you to help me find some answers. Thank you. However, there will be ample time for your second assignment, voluntaryof course. The pre-joining announcement of Counsellor Deanna Troi <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guilty of what? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must say, I was little surprised when Commander Riker told methat you were aboard the Jenolen. Our records didn't show you listed asa member of the crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It could be worse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North AmericanIndians settled? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must be very bored, Q. Your imagination is running awaywith you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, there is a Klingon vessel in the area. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is everyone all right? RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was fear. Fear of seeing you, losing my resolve. Fear ofstaying, losing myself. Fear that neither of these choices was right,and that, and that either would have <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've no intention of performing for your amusement. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they'reno longer at war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could he be some kind of android? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Suffice it to say, he's an expert. Commander, isyour contention that Lieutenant Commander Data is not asentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reservedfor all life forms within this Federation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there had to be some reason. In some way, you weredifferent from the other colonists. Yourgeographical location, your philosophical beliefs, the colour of youreyes. In some way you were set apart from them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see us one day becoming that, Q. Is it that what concernsyou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lower shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Donald, what's a nice Starfleet Captain like you doing in aplace like this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You do not leave this ship withoutauthorisation. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She didn't. The files were deleted, by your mother, almostthirty years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Data. Report to Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, our options in a quarantine situation are extremelylimited. We are going to consider the possibilities. I suggest you dothe same. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Instruct Engineering to proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey. Hot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, your Captain, Endar, has he ever hurt you? Inflictedpain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! Thank you. Captain's log, Stardate 43610.4. After completing adelivery of dicosilium to the Tanuga Four research station, our awayteam has received an update from Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts tocreate Krieger Waves, a potentially valuable new power source. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I can arrange that. Data, find the Pasteur. I havesome pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite possibly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but whatever my personal feelings, I haveno jurisdiction here. I simply cannot interfere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think that we attacked your outposts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. His name is Flaherty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough then Iwould begin to see some kind of pattern. So far, nothing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then explain the fractured ribs, concussion, the broken arm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know what business they might have together? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was not amused. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, beam the away team directly to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Moving trilithium resin requires veryspecific equipment. You can't simply improvise something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Timicin. Time for you to leave us,then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back. Counsellor. Geordi, Data, reconfigure thecomputer and the records. Number One, I want you to oversee the rest ofthe ship. And this time, let's get it right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive. See if youcan find some way to access it. And in the meantime, I'll see what Ican learn from these people inside Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, why wasn't the holodeck programmeterminated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, very convenient. We beam you back aboard your old shipand we have to take a risk that you won't change your mind and betrayus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Request approved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happened to your mind, Doctor? The search for knowledgeis always our primary mission. I'm sorry, I really am too busy for thiskind of nonsense. Do I have to call Security to force you to report tothe Sickbay? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is some greeting, old friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm greatly impressed with everythingI've seen so far, Prime Minister. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Collect your samples, Mister La Forge. We'll proceedwith caution. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, take us within transporter range. We're going to beamthem aboard directly onto the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. Request emergency power toinitiate lab quarantine seal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lunar Five, an orbiting gulag. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoidlifeforms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to keep it up long enough for Commander Riker to get tous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono! Jono, why do you make that noise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was in the neighbourhood. When I asked the Professor why hewent all the way to Kurl, he said, I was in the neighbourhood. Doingwhat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is Picard. This is the Captain. Can anyone hearme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And something else? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seems you're right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not here to command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tetryons? Like the emissions in the cargo bay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to warp engines, factor one. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I did not. Perhaps we have a poltergeist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Shelby, what is the status of out defencepreparations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise that. But it's safer for all concerned to leave onebehind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Arboretum. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Korris, this is Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hiccup? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey. Good man. First Officer's log, stardate 44307.6. Radiationlevels on the Enterprise continue to rise. The ventilation system hasstarted pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract theeffects. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not if you were to help me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is enough, damn it! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is simplistic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly whatfollowed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt. It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seal off the compartment. Prepare to vent the air from <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, and that's why you weren't affected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not satisfied. I want an explanation of this by thetime we reach Parliament. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So far our survey team has found no deaths or injuries amongthe crew. Shuttlecraft are all operational, as are the transporters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have one? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You would see them die rather than share the medicine? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has brought a knife with him, a knife is was supposed to bestained with the blood of Kahless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless he were forced to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As simple as that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You did what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dream not of today. The night blessing of the Yash-El. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. Inour arrogance we feel we are so advanced, and yet we cannot unravel asimple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone,without a computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's his job. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitiancivilisation are said to be magnificent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mister Data, scan. Myapologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've located the survivors from the Denver. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Here. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that is one possible definition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are they? Identify them! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And just what location are they accepted from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're talking about slavery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have no choice but to try. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You or I could learn to live with that disability, but not Worf. His life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it, we don't have to understand it, but we do have to respect his beliefs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation ofour treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll discuss it. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard. To whom am I speaking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eight? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was, I was thinking I, I might be imposing. I could veryeasily stay in the village. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not even troubling to cloak themselves. RIKER <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Hugh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, we're outside the door. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is he afraid of? Damn you. Help me! Why did you leave theship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean? Do they intend to destroy it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, that's true. Well, I can't waive them again. Onlycommissioned officers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Mister McDowell. I'll be at the service inTen Forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mrs. Carmichael. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Contact the Crazy Horse and the Agamemnon. Have them standingby in case we need them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship in the bottle. Model air ships. I used to build themwhen I was a child. My God, I bet I had a Promellian battle cruisertoo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amused? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should have listened to me at the beginning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have committed acts of aggression against the UnitedFederation of Planets. If you do not withdraw immediately <eos> <bos> PICARD: You insisted I look into her situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vigo, is that you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But don't touch anything! Try it out. Thepanel on your right is for log entries, library computer access andretrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have <eos> <bos> PICARD: Harm has already come to them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Come down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why did you come to Tagus Three? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do have some questions for you though. RIKER <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship, but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason forhis actions. You do, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your field generator on the planet surface has been sending outharmless energy charges, which this facsimile has been converting intoKrieger waves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's hear it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I have to study upon Regalian law. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, you know better than anyone there's noguarantee this will work. If it fails <eos> <bos> PICARD: In God's name, where did you learn to fight like this, man? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But futilely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet the Federation and the Cardassians have struggled toohard for peace to abandon it so easily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't help them. But it's my guess they're in no danger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shaka indeed. What now, Captain? Will you attack me in mysleep? If I don't freeze to death first. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he is right. We are in their solar system. Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have forty eight hours, because at forty eight plus six wehave an appointment at Pelleus Five we must keep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah! You called me Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. Robin Hood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck seventeen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And because the subspace wave would appear simply as backgroundradiation, no one would realise what was happening until it was toolate. Now, for the past few weeks, theta-band subspace emissions havebeen detected coming from Celtris Three. Those emissions may indicatethat a metagenic delivery system in operation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you may wait outside. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My friendship with Marta is not something I regret. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should be seeing stars by now. Data, howfar have we come? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The answer to all of this is feeding intoyour medical banks right now. Including a cure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians aredeveloping a new delivery system, one that would protect them fromaccidental exposure to the toxin. They believe that the Cardassians aretesting a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspacecarrier wave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter, prepare to beam Commander Riker aboard the Pagh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what do you read? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, have you launched the probe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's always risk, Doctor. Proceed with the examination, butI shall require positive proof that these children are harmless beforeI place any of my crew in jeopardy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare to transport Ambassador T'Pel to the Romulan ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not anything now, Number One. I'm just a man who's lookingfor answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Wesley? If we go down, I'd like you to join the awayteam to evaluate this world as a place for young people to relax. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Robert, why didn't you inform us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Paul Menegay, a seven year old. He did a most interesting claysculpture of my head. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what are these beings trying to tell us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish to be candid with you, Ensign. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can I do for you, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to warp four, Mister Bennett. Set a course for Starbasetwelve. Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A second artefact? Oh, by the way, that first artefacts is notRomulan. It's Vulcan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's a symptom of fatigue. We've all been inflicted onetime or another with that melody that won't go away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But this could be done through diplomatic channels, Admiral. What do you really want of us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not interested. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Q, you did not. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, chart a course for it immediately. Warp seven. And there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of thisdiversion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The antimatter flow regulator is locked open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time to impact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My orders are to maintain radio silenceuntil we've completed the mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm merely saying that I'm following up on evidence that myofficers discovered on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please sit down, Mister Tarses. For the record, will you tellus your name and position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Legends like that are the spice of the universe, Mister Data,because they have a way of sometimes coming true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you believe he might have gone there to see Pardek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse course, Ensign, three hundred kph. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker! <eos> <bos> PICARD: My Aunt Adele cured a lot of sleeplessnights with this steamed milk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, you didn't, Data. You got it. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusualorders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there'll be no atmospheric condensers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Speed, warp five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which would infect the entire Collective. We could disabletheir neural network at a stroke. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, you speak as if we are enemies, not allies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not unlike much the history of my own planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will reconvene on the Enterprise, wherein <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever the problem, we'll handle it up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel red alert. Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have beencontinuing our research, while the Federation Council studies ourpreliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain thatwhat we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, acknowledge! Fire torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're okay too. But <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's all right, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what is the purpose of your journey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring us out of warp, Ensign. All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did they leave? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of activity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You want me to give you transportation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll contact you as soon as the sensors are back online. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Please, Mister Worf. Come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because her people had contact with theBorg, I have requested Guinan to participate in this conference. Youare aware of what occurred just now in main Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, Wesley's alive and he's well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want to use you as other men do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could there be some sort of cloning involved here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you please note in the ship's log that thisaction is being taken over my explicit objections. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will captain the Hathaway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The code, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've read about them for years, but they were so delicate noone expected to find any preserved. How do you know about them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The planets that these fragments are from are scattered acrossthe quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor so long to collect them. But why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk yourlife to lead it personally? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you'resupposed to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of our starships under your control? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Certainty? Or speculation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the hold up, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's investigate both possibilities. Captain's log, stardate 44356.9. Sensor diagnosticshave been completed and indicate that all systems are normal. Thereremains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there are no more questions, you're all dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'llfind you other choices. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, request granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign, I didn'tmean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damnedcardiac replacement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, she survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going tofind her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who was the last person to speak with her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your son? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But nowthat he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with theaway team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Ensign Gates, set course for Starbase twonineteen, warp six. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, it took five men to restrain him and he took aparthalf of the Transporter Room in the process. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the boy in any danger? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Injury report, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How does this resignation threaten the ship and its crew in anyway? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I plan on leaving the same way you do. On your ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It has something to do with Counsellor Troi. Somehow when it'sdealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her. I'm going to beam down. Lieutenant Worf, you have the conn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother forthe fine Counsellor she <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if we could reverse that process? Cause time movebackwards and then forwards. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, will you come with me? I'd like our Doctor toexamine you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make itso. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you for your generous offer. I will take it underadvisement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seemthat we have at least one thing in common. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I 'was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Clusterfor myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes I have, Number One. Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not taking you anywhere. Captain's log, stardate 41602.1. The shuttlecrafthas been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving theplanet. Vagra Two will be declared off limits. But the damage has beendone. One of the saddest duties I've ever had to perform is now aheadof me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should know that is impossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I believe he does, Data. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rationalthese people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in thesupernatural. Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, tosend them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance andfear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused. NumberOne, tell me about this group's leader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was here in this room. I could have rid the Federation of amortal threat, and I let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That doesn't sound like the man who came to me a year agofiercely determined to return home and to clear his father's name ordie trying. Isn't it time to confront the Council? To regain yourfamily name? Let the truth be known? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Donald, we'll get our teams to work on it immediately. I'm sureneither of us feels too comfortable sitting around in the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For the first time since I've known you, I don't believe you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because you'd already been there once before, probably themoment you arrived on the planet. That's when you found it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He apparently has the power to heal injuries with a simpletouch. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I haven't talked to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were trying to determine our intent. Theywanted to see if we would fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they attacking anything other than nitrium alloy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I trust you will be comfortable here. If you will excuseme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. How do you make small talk with someone who shaped theFederation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I want you back aboard this ship. We'll beam you up insuspended animation like the boy. That will give us more time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were the first. The next day Commander Riker fell into asimilar coma. Last night, Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Notify Starfleet we are en route to the Xanthras system for ourrendezvous with the Zapata. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you are who you say you are, there's no need for any ofthis. We'll gladly take you home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan, that was twenty three years ago. Tasha Yar was only achild. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy. Someone with a reason for confining us here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you project a course from it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some ofus, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be inorder, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Perhaps you would agree to a more productiverelationship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank youfor your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are the modifications to the torpedoescomplete? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're circling the room like a buzzard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Data, will you leave your hesitation and self-doubt here inyour quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have been at peace for many years. Let us not rush headlonginto war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And a ship's cloaking field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. Mister Worf, keep a close eye on Q's friends outthere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange? In what way? Non-human? Artificial? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've discussed that. We are studying means of bringing hersafely off the holodeck. But five hours is not enough time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, have you been ableto lock on to the away team? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For ambitious Starfleet officers, there are certain costsinvolved. One must be cautious of long-term commitments, Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Temba is a person? His arms wide. Because he's holding themapart in, in generosity. In giving. In taking. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they'restill together, how far could they have travelled in three hours? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Prepare a tractor beam. Mister La Forge, I'm goingto assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, we understand that DaiMon Solok runs cargo there from timeto time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How close to the Cardassian border are we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I detonate it. But how? How do I do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As ready as I'll ever be, Number One. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it's not that. Or is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because youthink it is connected to some higher purpose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of the Federation's timetable, Number One. ProfessorGalen visited here a few days ago. And he was on his way to Indri Eightwhen he was killed. There's some connection between these two planets. I'm going to find it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, over here! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something funny? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's an excellent one if you'll just hurry up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: According to Starfleet regulations, that would be my onlycourse of action. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm not doingyou a favour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you break a few rules? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I put it to you all. I think we shall end up with a fine crew,if we avoid temptation. So, Number One, let's go to our next job. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Easily? Oh no, not easily. We handle it because we're trainedto, as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But if the time ever comeswhen the death of a single individual fails to move us <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can you determine, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leave it to Robert to find the best cook in France, then marryher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's all? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One thousand and fourteen, including your guest, Doctor Quaice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She has a Romulan cloaking device? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You did not think so when it worked in your favour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All I'm saying is that you removed something which clearly didnot belong to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: While on board, you are welcome to supervise the return of yourcrew, but I cannot allow Jeremiah Rossa to be returned to your custody. His true family are waiting for him on Earth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Her belly may be full, but her spirit will be empty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did everyone know about this except me? I'll be all rightsitting here. You go off with the others. Hold onto my grandson, andwatch the damned thing go up for all the good it'll do. What is itthey're launching? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the line of duty. She was thefinest example of a Starfleet <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, the Kurlan civilisation believed that an individual was acommunity of individuals. Inside us are many voices, each with its owndesires, its own style, its own view of the world. The Kurlancivilisation died out thousands of years ago. It is extraordinarilyrare to find a figurine intact. Professor, this is an incredible find. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. Nelson toured the Victory beforeTrafalgar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Credit where credit is due, madam. I can see you are a womannot only of breeding, but of wit and sagacity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything would help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, you do. You're a culture of one, which is no less validthan a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding yourexperience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When welook at Michaelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb and we don't ask whatdoes this mean to other people. The real question is, what does it meanto us? Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focuson it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Children are not allowed on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm truly sorry, Liator, but I must have justice for my peopletoo. Transporter room, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the plasma exploded that would explain a few things. Let meknow when the analysis is complete. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Lutan, what do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that never gets easier. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you who attacked the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you would do me the pleasure of getting this shipunderway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. Good work, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems he built that bridge. I may be forced to tear it down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have my word as a Starfleet officer that I will not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Plot a course. Maximum warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's concentrate on how this anomaly wasinitially formed. Speculation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, anything would be helpful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole, but ifit should explode near the shuttlecraft they will be destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course for Seronia. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fascinating. So many questions. How can a two-dimensionalentity have access to a three-dimensional universe? And are they awareof us? Number One, if we can put off the T'lli Betans, I would like toinvestigate this further as soon as we're free of the graviton field. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Answer for them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf has served under my command with distinction. He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish thatthis Council, in its wisdom, will clear his family name and return himto duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Donald, that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeologicalcuriosity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deaf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what it says on my door. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do they represent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure of your point. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! <eos> <bos> PICARD: You do this of your own accord? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must consider all options, Doctor, and not let our personalfeelings impede our judgment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I haveresponsibilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns. Games and toys and clothes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but <eos> <bos> PICARD: They return home, leaving theassistant manager in charge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You might have taken the simple precaution of locking the door. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the question remains, why? What is its purpose? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, Commander, make it so. Meanwhile, we will maintain ourpresent course. If there is something wrong with Data, wedon't want him to be aware of our suspicions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, I'm not going to play along with this. If you want tocontinue this charade, you can do it alone. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any indication of the source? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Now please follow Commander Riker's instructions so ourship can get back to its normal routine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, all too often. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, run Manua programme one, time code, fourteen threeeight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How so, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, for what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, where is Lieutenant Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, centuries ago these North American Indians wereforcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers on DorvanFive originally left Earth more than two hundred years ago in order topreserve their cultural identities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's defended by Starfleet. You don't think they're just goingto stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much Iadmire his son. Hello, Alexandra. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, it seems clear that your husband was motivated toearn the kind of rewards that pleased you, Mrs. Apgar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Officer, and a young woman ofremarkable courage <eos> <bos> PICARD: They managed to get their shields back up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's go see if we can find them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you understand our need to verify your claim. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, there is no question that the Romulan officer is morevaluable to us alive than dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sensor difficulties have been reported by ships travellingthrough black clusters, but never this extreme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you did steal it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare your team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Which iswhy Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically indiscipline <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've locked it off. We must find another way to get in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you propose? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said it was important that I see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room. Computer, delay time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No further questions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The uniqueness of this presentation provoked this inadvertentbreach in protocol. No insult was intended. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I speak now as the Captain of the Enterprise and LieutenantWorf's commanding officer. You will not executea member of my crew, nor will I turn his brother over to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But according to the legend, the Stone was destroyed by thegods when the Vulcan people found the way to peace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The external power is cut off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was almost hoping that you'd find a problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our medical officer discovered evidence of injuries so severe,they might be considered torture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, how can I talk to her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let's find out. Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I could use your help with the infuser array. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My God. Phillipa Louvois. And back inuniform. It's been ten years, but seeing you again like this makes itseem like fifty. If we weren't around all these people, do you knowwhat I would like to do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does that mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're almost identical. How do you explain that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The performance of my crew is none of the Ambassador'sbusiness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our options? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kallisko, change course. Take evasive action. Do whatever youcan to outrun it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Mister La Forge, begin work on that homing device. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You remember Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is the way in which we propagate our species. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to the Bridge <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare to transport us to the same location Ensign Ro beamedto. Mister Worf, phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Release the exterior hull plate. We mayhave to jettison the core. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called theStargazer. It was an overworked, underpowered vessel, always on theverge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable sense, myEnterprise is far superior. But there are times when I would givealmost anything to command the Stargazer again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. You can. But only I can command them. They follow myorders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, we've lost transmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything we can do to stop it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said you had the realisation of impossible dreams to offerus. When this rescue is completed, I am prepared to listen carefully towhatever proposal you wish to make and subject to it being acceptable Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what would that be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've invited Anya to take a tour of the ship. Maybe you would like to join her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any transmissions are simply scattered and refracted at random. No wonder you can't get through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it has. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must calm your people. There is no reason for panic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we're overdue for our computer refit. Number One, have youever considered whether Data is more human, or less human than we want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently so, Number One. Starfleet believes that theirpresence is an attempt at communication. Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And from that point we have been existing in a holodecksimulation created by Professor Moriarty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You read all this, telepathically? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We did not attack you. We gave chase in order to recover aFederation-owned energy device which <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, something has obviously gone wrong with your circuitry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may be very much closer indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You made it, Number One. Smooth ride? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're your brothers, your sons, and you turned your backs onthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw TashaYar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach awounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as hadmine. When it was all over, I requested that she be assigned to theEnterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour. In the months thatfollowed, she never once failed to put the safety of the crew beforeher own, and she died doing the same. I'm sorry you never knew thewoman Tasha became. I think you would have been proud of her. And sheof you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of problem, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many on board? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We shouldstay on this course until we have reason to change it. But in themeantime, I think we should do what we can to avoid a collision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Things are only impossible until they're not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, Number One. Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dream not of today. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a human that has the answers to a lot of questions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a price. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I activate the viewer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What will you do now ? 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: After that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have an away team on the planet. We are waiting for a windowin the storm to beam them up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course, Number One. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Horse. Earth horse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, now you do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are entitled to consultation under paragraph six hundred andfifty three subparagraph nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Timothy, can you tell us what happened toyour ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, please accompany him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground, struckdown by the gods. And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying, 'he who wasmy companion through adventure and hardship, is gone forever. First Officer's log, supplemental. Despite the riskof war, I have no choice but to break the stalemate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened to the shuttlecraft, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my deathsentence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member ofyour away team. I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please may I have your attention. Please may I have yourattention! Stop that immediately! Well, that's better. Now,what's your name, young man? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even my sensory perception picked that up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievementfor his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans areincalculable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you wish. A short goodbye. Computer, save the programme ofthe character Moriarty, and then discontinue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A life form. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the point of creating this fantasy? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: None at all, Mister Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I'veprovided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Perhaps you'd liketo make use of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? At our first meeting you seized my vessel. You condemnedall humans as savages, and on that charge you tried us in a post-atomictwenty first century court of horrors, where you attacked my people. You again seized my vessel. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us to warp seven point two one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us onthis heading. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's has been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence onRisa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to find out how widespread thiseffect is. Contact Starbase Twenty three, that's the nearest outpost. Have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs oftemporal reversion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you were ordered to rendezvous with the fleetat Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship's computers sense a localised increase <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Miss Rogers. I'm delighted to have you aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're bringing you in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I suggest a secured channel, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could take you with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time to asteroid field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Main Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grand. Mister Data, when we have a complete list of all thespecimens we will be carrying, I want you and Doctor er, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume course, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. I suggest a steady pace, not a brisk one. We need toration our energy. Try breathing through your nose. That way it willhelp to prevent dehydration. I'll lead. Captain Dirgo, will you bringup the rear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have a real look. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At last. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Doctor, the station must be evacuated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I know what your word means. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So that takes care of the why. Now, what can you do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope that's not a stutter. I don't know how long a delaythere will be between the launch and the detonation. I'll hold keyingthe launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until theEnterprise reappears? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, and you are not programmed to murder cowards. So if theywill not fight back, what will you do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identify them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what are your thoughts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened back there, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any luck? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, the system is clear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently so. How long were we unconscious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No other logical solutions? But Ambassador, there are alwaysother solutions. You have said so yourself many times. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They reverted to a simpler existence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We seem to be in some kind of undergroundstructure, but I don't see any. Hey, no, you don't. No time to sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he going to be all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There. Right, then let's get to work. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want a Security team stationed outside Sickbay, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Position, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That'll have to wait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. I am Jean Luc <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come onboard. Would you care to meet us in the Observation Lounge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm reallyanxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,but two of the Howard women. <eos> <bos> PICARD: See if you can contact the colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room four, prepare to beam aboard from inside thatshuttle anything large enough to be a humanoid adult. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe that Chapter Four, Article Twelve of the Uniform Codeof Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioningbegins. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Either leave my Bridge or I will remove you by force. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. Run Riker programme two, time code, sixteenone zero. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's an old human expression. Mister LaForge hopes that we'vegot close to achieving what you wanted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've foundout that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it'sonly petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I hadbeen part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about my crew? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate the transformation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, will you bring Timothy to my Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Readyphasers, load torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly when will they reach Haven? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of any kind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am. The last time I had to train like this was for theAcademy marathon, but I'm managing. What can I do for you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Asylum? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No, let's help all of us. Generalquarters. Red Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Many. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuses, Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want all departments prepared for a warpsix trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team completes itsmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as ittravels backwards in time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer onlyspecific charges. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that's not the truth? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on theBridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, you can tell Commander Data he has my permission tocontact his friend and conduct her to a safer location. Number One, youknow where we are now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my mark, fourminutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prove to the court that I am sentient. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the possibility exists, no matter how slight, that theseexocomps are lifeforms, then we must examine that possibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we hadon our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck nine. Officers' quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for humanlife signs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe this is some form of information exchange withwhatever is over there. At least, I hope it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage tractor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You knowthe effects of your poison. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Food and water? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up somestartling results. Will you join us, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I', doing my best, although I'm finding some of the ritualsquite demanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good idea. I hope you learned that running away solves nothing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you launch another probe. This time a ClassOne with full sensor array. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in alllanguages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are notasking for any terms or conditions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, and now we must leave you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base ofoperations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, make sure that booby trap doesn't bother anyoneagain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why are you doing this, Kamala? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I really haven't thought that far ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Batai? JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Phillipa. Dinner? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't misunderstand me, Counsellor. Your mother is a beautifulperson, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha, set coordinates to beam it back where it came from. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please respond, Ten Forward. Are there any members of mycrew who require medical assistance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a bad idea whose time is long past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I knew of him. He was teaching at the University when I was inParis, but I didn't have the pleasure. I must change. Number One,inform me half an hour before we reach those co-ordinates. Keep tryingto determine if the time distortion was specifically located on theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pipe it through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of problems? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As of now, we don't have sufficient evidence one way or theother. I want you to examine her shuttle. You might find somethingthere which will shed some light on her story. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The transporter need not pattern your Captain into matter. We'll beam energy only, and we will become a combined energy pattern ofour life forms. A resignation from this command and from Starfleet hasbeen appropriately recorded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll attend to my duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, they used that expertise and turned to cloning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in ajoint exploration of the planet surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring him in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is the fourth intersect in Jefferies tube twentyfive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, it would that we have found thequantum signature you are looking for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How unlikely? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, thank you. Everything is under control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Ambassador T'Pel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And his father? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nella. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And mine, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Corey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. Wesley, that's not true. You're a fine young man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is he now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell has just sent more than six hundred of them totheir deaths. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Rabal? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, I need to see you on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your mentors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, this is very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll betaking on new personnel at Starbase one eighteen in a few weeks. Surelythe drills can wait until then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know Mister Mendoza, the Federation negotiator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, Counsellor <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not require one, Tomalak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I would recommend that we ask both sides if they wouldagree to meet in the city of Darthen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Penetrable? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a perfectly good shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't our sensors alert us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Easy, Number One. Let's find out what it iswe're dealing with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sense anything, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, sir. My first officer will be joining us shortly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may have to, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I don't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It wouldn't be possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes outevery year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailingfrequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where did it originate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Prepare for evasive action at the first change inthe Romulan's course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousandyears ago. Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his societyat hand and he conceived this Contract of Ardra to motivate change. Ormaybe there was an Ardra of some sort who is the basis of thismythology. Who knows? The point is that somehow a fundamental theologywas created which transformed this society, but in the process ofchange, created this latent fear which has been passed down throughgenerations. Data, from your own experience of performing EbenezerScrooge, you're aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any problems reported in that area? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know what it is. Don't sedate him. Let him be. Please. Lethim to remain conscious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When Pierre de Fermat died they found this equation scrawled inthe margin of his notes. X to the nth plus Y to the nth equals Z to thenth, where n is greater than 2, which he said had no solution in wholenumbers. But he also added this phrase. Remarkable proof. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand this is difficult. All I can do is ask you totrust me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How's life on DS Three? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean a Tyken's rift. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The admiral displayed a remarkableimprovement out there, wouldn't you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling, Wesley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You requested this posting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, Doctor. Have you been briefed on what's happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Mister Data. Now we know where he's headed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran that I'm working as fast as I can. What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. Initiate long range scans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to look through the personnel files ofUtopia Planitia. See if you can recognise any of those faces. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain our present course and speed for now. I'm going tofind out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support thishypothesis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agreewith you. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stop firing! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But Data, they were already dead. I mean, what more could havehappened to them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Always. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've piqued my interest, Number One. Please continue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meribor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if the doors are closed, then the backwash from the rocketswill spill into the power grids and there'll be an overload. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a case of simple mediation. You are asking me tochoose the next leader of the Klingon Empire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously it works very rapidly, but how does it work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, scan for a class-M environment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did endwith the United States taking its place as a dominant world power andcultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century. Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement. Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourthcentury. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Violate the Prime Directive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a StarfleetCaptain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't ita little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain'sjudgment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume you have control of the computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I'm not mistaken, she just did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodness had nothing to do with it. Three to beam up. MisterData will remain on the surface. Data, I want a complete report on thecontents of these documents. I refuse to abandon this planet to thatwoman. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I selfaware? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will wait for me in the corridor. Hisinsubordination is growing by leaps and bounds. I could use discipline,but I'd rather try and help him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Release him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In for a penny, in for a pound, is that what you're saying,Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened after the welcoming ceremony? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume previous course, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reunification? After so many centuries? After so manyfundamental differences have evolved between your peoples? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to station yourself outside herquarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps you would clarify it for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, take us in as close as possible to the freighter's orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Miss Odell, I <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, you need help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any chance of your freeingPalmer and transporting up unseen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard. Welcome aboard. We hope your journey willbe pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my First Officer,Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: You seem I've always believed that becoming involved withsomeone under my command would compromise my objectivity. And yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Will you advise Commander Riker Iwill meet with him in one hour. Picard out. The Admiral is taking theposition that Lal's development should be overseen by the mostexperienced personnel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage impulse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're fine. Everything is in order. But now, I want a completecheck, all systems, all divisions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? Status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if they're moving among humans, they must have taken onhuman form. But the question is, how do we know who we're looking for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do we bypass the security system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did you find it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quomodo tua Latinitas est? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some other time, Q. Right now I have other matters to attendto. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter when they werebeamed aboard? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The moment those Vulcan ships appear in the Neutral Zone, theEnterprise will move to intercept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the nearest starbase. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you must mean it's empty of matter. There's alwayssome energy form at work. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Considerably. It appears the Ferengi have us right where theywant us. In their sights. Are you searching all frequencies? Any signof any kind of messages? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it isn't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truthabout what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your daughter is lovely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long to rendezvous, Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me see. This way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report back to the ship when you're ready, Commander. Doctor,we'll stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances,but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean Luc Picard of the Enterprise. For whatreason have you locked your weapons on us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there anything we can do to help? You and your staff arewelcome aboard for a change of scene, rest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are our rather quarrelsome guests? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you are going to refuse his offer, you must not allowyourself to use this power again. It's too great a temptation for us atour present stage of development. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could your friend have returned to the starbase without tellingyou? An emergency of some sort? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm just thinking that I'm saying goodbye to you as you aretoday. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I'll be in my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you see the Counsellor to her quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If an automated message system is still functioning, therecould be other systems on that planet that are still operational. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about my quarters? More intimate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. You'll make a fine judge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. Butalthough I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do nothing that he asks. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is your quarantine intact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Without an antigrav harness? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna. wait a minute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I get the feeling from your mother that you have something totell me. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then should we try to keep her asleep? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of,even if they don't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Launch probe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before impact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. Governor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course for a return to Starbase one three threeimmediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data is a Starfleet officer. He still has certain rights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just the computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how can he turn his back on them so easily? How can heendorse reunification when it's considered subversive? 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Contact Gowron's ship. Tell him to meet us aboard K'mpec'svessel. Ambassador, meet me in Transporter room six in an hour. We willbegin the ceremony a little late. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This child is supposed to bring them together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. You've beenhere before. You negotiated a release of the hostages with Karnasbefore. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid? It's my away teamyou're sending in there. I think there's something you're not tellingme, and I have a right to know what it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must miss him very much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I growup again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybefifteen years. The question is what to do until then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't recall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you know I like to keep youwell informed as to the nature of our missions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm so sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a provision in the Federation Constitution thatprotects an individual's fundamental rights. Now once you were broughtaboard this ship <eos> <bos> PICARD: As am I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a way, I wish he'd never come on board the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are you certain that this is the right decision? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Disconnect the power-transfer beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riva, if you are ready, the situation at Solais Five is verycritical. We should not delay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The good doctor was kind enough to provide me with a recordingof your concert. Your performance shows feeling. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All that remains is the possibility of communication. Theremight be some way that we can warn them of their impending destruction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I apologise for the delay in our arrival,Ambassador Briam. We had to stop at Harod Four to pick up a group ofstranded miners. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's going to take some getting used to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You could tell them that in order to get past the check points,they're shipping the components for these weapons through thirdparties, and then we could put together a convoy and send it toward theDemilitarised Zone. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's alcohol. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And issue a general distress call. Yes, Mister Data, I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This equipment will have to be confiscated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Expanding? I thought that time was suspended on this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None of the scans show any anomalies. No signs of an intruder. Wesley's experiment clearly did not have the scope to affect an entirestarship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to initiate warp drive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Itself, then. Itself or it's own power source. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, when you scanned the temporal aperture with yourtricorder, it caused time to move forwards and then back again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is correct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Alexander, would you mind if I borrowed your toy for alittle while? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That happens to be why I came to Risa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I mean, why you are here on this ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're just keep getting deeper and deeper in, aren't we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're discussing the Ferengi. I wish I had some clue as to whatthey will do next. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean Luc Picard, commander of the Federationstarship Enterprise. If you continue to violate the cease fire, Iwill abort this mission. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can you implement your tachyon detection gridwith twenty ships? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Picard to Ensign Ro. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yvette Gessard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was just thinking that as distracting as it was, I wasbeginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and I find that I missit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers knoweach other's abilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. Butwhat you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said thatall of humanity will be destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that wehave another option. Very well, let's give it a try. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we must hurry or we'll missCommander Riker's party. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Also becomes a reality. We must,therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication what caused this hallucination? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our sensor array is useless. We must find some other way oflocating him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's true, Number One. But if the transmitters and thesensors were removed and life-support installed, there would be justenough room for one person. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're prepared to transfer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us thatwe have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alienworlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I havedisregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thoughtit was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to sometemporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't itpossible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to helpme to choose, because it's the right thing to do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand your desperation. The shock of learning you weredying. But you had no right to do what you have done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's the assumption. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan is not the issue here. You are. We had an agreement thatyou would stop meddling with us. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, if it is me you're investigating,ask me directly what it is you want to know. And please tell me exactlywhat is going on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise. Enterprise, do you read me? Enterprise, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. If I could just get access to the Enterprisecomputer just for a few moments. So, what will Baran do once he'sobtained the second artefact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happening? Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Commander Riker's meeting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan? Yes everything's fine. Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it's unusual to fly on sensors alone in this type ofmanoeuvre. The pilot relies on visual clues from the other ships tomaintain formation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not to me! Notify Starfleet. Priority. Hail the Ferengi on mycommand. Formulate alternatives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am sorry to report your comrade's injuries are beyondour medical abilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, how will you end the experiment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's time for you return to the ship, Mister La Forge. MisterO'Brien, stand by to transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killedhim for doing it. I think we have to risk it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, how long have you held your appointment onboard thisvessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm afraid not. But we will be visiting the hydroponics andastrophysics laboratories. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of hercompletely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,if you wouldn't mind telling me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it toshape itself into whatever form you needed! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Setting, San Francisco California, UnitedStates Of America. The year, 1945 A. D. The office of Dixon Hill,Private Investigator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what was the foremost archaeologist in the Federationdoing here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep SpaceFour, and then an Al-Leyan transport to Caere, and then the shuttle toIndri Eight. Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Briam has supervised a reproduction of the ancient Temple ofAkadar on our holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Brull, she's here, isn't she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, something's happened to me. I'mnot sure Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain RikerPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister LaForge, give him a hand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This ship has encountered several incidents which might suggesta potential alliance between those two powers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean by that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my experiences, mymental capacities are all intact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No wonder it attacked us. It was about to give birth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On what basis, Admiral, am I to decide? Your good word? Are youwilling to help us overpower the Romulan B-type warbirds we mayencounter? Are you prepared to help us detect them through theircloaking shields? You see my problem, Admiral. You ask us for faith incircumstances which are hardly possible to believe, compounded by liesand your refusal to tell us all you know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever your motives, you've already done enough to damagethese negotiations. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you tried synaptic induction? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your service aboard theEnterprise has been exemplary. Until now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How could you? How could any of us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn'tsomething that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go forgood. It's not something I'm not prepared to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, layin a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate astatic warp shell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just explain what brought us here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you to maintain this course for another hourPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you believe the Mintakans arecapable of harming Counsellor Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And your search led you to me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Allow us safe passage and I will protect your right to privacyto the best of my ability. We will never tell anyone of your existence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating throughlanguage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Replicators and stabilisers. Two totally unrelated systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of passenger? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, so we are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, there you are. We start rehearsals tomorrow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have no right to put us through this just to satisfy yourcuriosity. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Space-time to normal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We were traveling at warp two through the Maxia Zeta starsystem when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired onus, point-blank range. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to pilot the shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You had no reason to leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Like a decompression tank? Let's try it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Five, four <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've read your reports. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, that was a remarkable performance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Present condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seventy five years is a long time. If you would care to studysome technical schematics or <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Constitution classEnterprise, Captain James T. Kirkcommanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Audio on. You have a burn-out in your guidance system, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done. Warp engines ready on previousheading. Warp factor six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He knows I'm here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room, when your duties permit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our memorial service may have been premature. What anachievement. 'So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long livesthis, and this gives life to thee.' <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it's worse than that. My guess is this refining processof which you are so proud <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will? That's true. I started off calling you Beverly, and ofcourse, naturally, you. I'm still not thinking straight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss itin the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a pity you didn't try using the holodeck instead ofsetting fire to your quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The geetas? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know whatyou've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. Youmade it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your techniquewas flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctorinvestigated it, she discovered what you had done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you find, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's in a state of total anarchy. When the Prime Minister wasassassinated, a Federation research team was on the planet. It'sbelieved that they were forced into hiding. Your mission will be tolocate and to evacuate them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which control keys? Damn. Of course, you can't see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp nine. Course, one five one mark three three zero. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which is not surprising, considering how closely theirevolution parallels Vulcan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inertial dampeners are offline. Life support is failing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Excuse me, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you climb up? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Stop this foolishness, Q. Return meto the Enterprise. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't accept that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Investigator, in our system of jurisprudence, a man is innocentuntil proved guilty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why angry? Why were you angry at me, Wesley? Were you angry atme because I was the one who told you your father was dead? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, lay in a course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Mrs. Carmichael Right there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter intoany <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting he was conscious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A straw? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this how the Iconians travelled? Crossing light years aseasily as we would cross a room? Those places could be on worlds indistant sectors of the galaxy. I think the Iconians might haveout-foxed their enemies. Maybe they didn't all die in the bombardment. Some of them could have passed through this. This is what Varleyfeared. This is what he died for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

But then, I never could spell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to biolab four. Alexander, can you hear us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Father and son. Both proud, both stubborn, more alike thaneither of them were prepared to admit. A lifetime spent buildingemotional barriers. They're very difficult to break down. And now thetime has come, it's too late. It's a difficult moment. It's a lonelyone. It's a moment Spock is about to face. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Home? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarianship so far off course? What was its point of departure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's your analysis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You want Federation involvement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You understand I will not cooperate with you in any way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of what nature? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about Geordi and Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, actually, I wasn't <eos> <bos> PICARD: Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximumacceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, meansthat we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hopeis to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our onlyother option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth asthey demand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From South America. This is Madeline, my secretary, and I wantyou to meet Rex. You know, I don't think I ever heard your last name? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am pursuing it with due vigilance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's our heading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: At least you kept your wits about you out there. Don't forgetthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. What were the analytical team's findings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is not for sale. Commander Data is, um, is, um <eos> <bos> PICARD: Walker! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And all your senses tell you that this woman here is the mostpowerful force on this planet, don't they? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Mister Worf, the Bridge wouldn't be the same without you. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Today you were dropping your foil. You kept letting me inside. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The incident that you wereinvolved in at the Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our Data has said the same thing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, we appear to be facing <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't we, Admiral? In all these discussions, no one hasever mentioned her wishes. She's a free, sentient being. What are yourwishes, Lal? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Professor Moriarty has agreed not to interfere withroutine ship operations so long as he believes we're acting in goodfaith, then I don't think we're in immediate danger. Any progress? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet. Inform him of our projected time of arrival. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. What would you say if I told you that I believed that Iwas capable of being very much more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, continue emitting the signals. Mister Worf, on screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I mustrespectfully decline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, you are not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then let's get to it. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, it came in handy. I only wish I'd had the opportunityto use it on a horse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, his name is Jeremiah, Jeremiah Rossa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the twoof you will find some way to deal with the situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, why didn't you contact Starfleet? Let them knowwhat happened on board the station? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless it's followed by three wavy lines, in which case the Zbecomes a B. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I never realised that you were interestedin trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carriedmore than ten thousandpeople a year? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay between the Ferengi and the Hathaway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral. I have to tell you, you must notexpect me to permit any action against Mister Tarses solely on thebasis of Betazoid intuition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full stop. What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry, Number One. I didn't mean to interrupt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. I visited there twelve years ago, while commanding theStargazer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can give you all safe passage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ro Laren? From the Wellington? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How would they react? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, what you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral. I'll fight it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, so far we have an isolated incident. If I can reachhim first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail. But if one of your ships decides to retaliate, there is a danger wecould lose control of the situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amanda's question deserves an answer, Q. You've made yourselfjudge, jury, and if necessary executioner. By what right have youappointed yourself to this position? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you pack them? What logical purpose do they serve? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, unlike King Henry, it is not easy for me to disguisemyself and walk among my troops. That'll be all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any evidence of that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that Lieutenant Riker will be happy to help you withthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't rendezvous with the Havana for another two days. That'll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, escort her to quarters. There's no need foryou to travel in the cargo bay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then the Uthat actually exists? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hard about, full impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is going on here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is being treated for severe injuries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering, can we transfer auxiliary power to thewarp nacelles? Try to break us out by using the <eos> <bos> PICARD: Everything. Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy froma former first officer of mine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Daedalus class. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasmafield, highly disruptive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Prieto, is Counsellor Troi all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A narrow vision. You will become one with the Borg. You willall become one with the Borg. The android, Data. Primitive artificialorganism. You will be obsolete in the new order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride inyou. His love. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand your sacrifice, Captain. Unfortunately, if ourfriend out there has its way, no one will ever know what you tried todo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. At your convenience. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Thank you very much. <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can believe it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some other time perhaps. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take it back, Number One, and this timenothing is going to lure us away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing, it will be adiscovery of extraordinary value. But it is a big if. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to this location. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. Hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider andapprove you a transfer for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Stone of Gol! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Director Mandl, I put it to you again. Whatdo you know about these life forms? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, after we've passed through thewave, I want you to take us at a relative position twenty threekilometres in front of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will be in orbit around Peliar Zel within six hours. If youcould arrange for the representatives of Alpha and Beta to be there,then Ambassador Odan could beam directly down to the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Distress signal? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q. It's about time you showed up. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time to come home now, Number One. Transporter room, we have afix on the away team. Beam them up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I just wanted to see if you were still listening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No one has been hurt. You have achieved your objective. Youhave your planet back in order. We have our ship. Well, it's been sometime since I had the conn. But not to worry, Number One, you're in goodhands. Starbase 74, warp two. Engage. Everything's under control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which under most circumstances would be unconscionable. But asI see it, the Borg leave us with little choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll serve you better here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Ensign. Mister Worf, launch the probe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How interesting. And you  PICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: I pledge we will do everything possible to assist yourcontinued survival. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One further thing. A special favour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously you feel it's something we should look at morecarefully. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, we can stall the representatives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. I want him kept under constant surveillance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look Corey, we're not cadets anymore. We're officers. We shouldstart to set a higher standard for ourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I can explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander La Forge. What's our status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you have, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought you might enjoy the Bridge, Miss Brianon. I'm awareof your interest in science. Perhaps you'd like to see the computerterminal <eos> <bos> PICARD: Disengage the tachyon pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire in sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Again, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very strange, Number One. Like going back to the house you grewup in, but no one's home, except the phantoms of the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now. Reconsider your decision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no FarpointStation, if I'm right about this. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution. Memory invasion is simply not a crime we've ever had to contend with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vorin, listen to me. We can visit many other worlds. We cantake you to one where you can build a new life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but ina situation like this, we have to be cautious. What we do today mayprofoundly affect upon the future. If we could see every possibleoutcome <eos> <bos> PICARD: At last. Did you read that book I gave you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan, they will die moments after they return. How can I askthem to sacrifice themselves based solely on your intuition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to impulse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did they show any interest in assimilating you or yourtechnology? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must understand, Number One <eos> <bos> PICARD: If her discomfort is going to affect her judgement or herobjectivity, I need to know now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This may not be good medicine, but for Worf, it may be his only choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into whatappears to be one of the earlier hominids. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routinesafety precaution. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'll go down there myself. Keep me apprised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems that Mrs Troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill fortoday. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You hoped this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was adangerous creature on this planet and you knew from the tale of Darmokthat a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmokand Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here, at El-Adrel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You admit the truth and yet expect him to accept punishment? What does this say of an Empire who holds honour so dear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Call me Dix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can there be an intelligence at work here? Counsellor, do yousense a lifeform out there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Locarno has been expelled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gotcha! Now I gotcha. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is our mission to seek out life in all forms. We areprivileged to have been present at the emergence of a new species. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just not one who stands out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energy? Is that why you're draining our shields? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I honestly don't know. Good-bye my friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would explain why they're so far awayfrom Romulan space. To avoid being picked up on Federation long rangescans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am interrogative, yes, and I would appreciate an explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek! I've come a long way to see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counsellor, do youbelieve a ship Captain should explain every order? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No signs of phaser burns on the hull. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can a geometric form disable a computer system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am here at my own request. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. Of course, that duty will fall to Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if you succeed, can you use that information to help yourmother? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, estimate the time from this location to Starbase fourone six at warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may proceedPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, at the risk of being rude. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: At ease. It's Captain, actually. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seen from far, far above. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or there is another possibility, Counsellor. This could benothing more than simple <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prognosis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you were, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase to warp nine. How long, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire when ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened on Rana Four? The truth this time. All of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can we beam up the injured? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions,Professor, and now, I have twenty million reasons to do so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you reallydo have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust andloyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying she's been bitten? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are capable of matter-energy transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in wasvengeance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's correct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has brought a child onto my ship and on my Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by takingover our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finishus. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now,according to our customs, is called an act of war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has arrived with Governor Torak. Pleasereport to the Observation lounge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is something the matter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you treat him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineerreport to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Hoy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineeringimmediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: About what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You call this getting along? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Another white dwarf star. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Ardra, will you would do the honours and stop thetremors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? I always rather had to work at that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Steady. Now, reverse and stop! Phasers fire, torpedoes away! Fire. Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you tell me what manoeuvre this is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There must be one of any number of people could coordinatetheir deployment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get out of my chair. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's reassemble in six hours. Stay sharp. No surprises. Iwould rather outthink them than outfight them. Questions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have unfinished business there. I need to have a talk withthose two people. You have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return me to my ship! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can no longer consider the DarwinStation crisis our most immediate concern, although Doctor Pulaski'scondition is inseparably linked with that emergency. Her safe returnand that of Commander Data must take priority, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a Vulcanpeace initiative? I have some difficulty in accepting that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Predict current vector of Borg ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: The important things never will be. Anyone can be trained inthe mechanics of piloting a starship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it's true, I have done my homework I have examined thefindings of every archaeological expedition conducted on the planetsurface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Probably getting into more trouble than Wesley, I can assureyou. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a loneliness inherent in that whisper from thedarkness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understand, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bok! Where is Bok? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have your orders, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should take a look at it, Number One. Stand by with an awayteam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it? How so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf is not gone. The family you served needs you again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course for the Brechtian Cluster. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not at all. Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, andthey fell in love. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is theonly one who can do that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's beautiful. A wonderful testimony to simpler times. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. We are operating at ninety six percentengine efficiency. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Number One. Now, Lieutenant, conduct theCommander to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage deflector shield, now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold on, Jake. It's going to be a little bumpy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think, Number One, we cannot assume anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what better place to find oneself than on the streets ofone's home village. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Name. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Everyone stand back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then T'Jon, and Romas, indeed everyone on their world? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am not Dixon Hill. I just look like Dixon Hill. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, we will all be serving together. Commander Rikerand I have expectations of you. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: How will you gain access? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I require an explanation, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a terrifying prospect to lose control of one's mind. WhenI was young, I remember watching my grandfather deteriorate from apowerful, intelligent figure to a frail wisp of a man, who could barelymake his own way home. Mister Data, it is my responsibility somehow tosee that this ship is guided to safety. I will need to rely on you fromnow on. We may need to count on you for our very survival. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley. WESLEY <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any commissioned rank? Even ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If it were possible, what would you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. Mask out the photosphere. Magnify. Quadrant oneseven, magnification factor twelve. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Contact Commander Riker on Betazed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I noticed that Lieutenant Worf put Ensign D'Amato on report forinsubordination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you know his whereabouts now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, get up. Get up. You must not kneel to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope not. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until we return, then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this isFederation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these peopleare under my jurisdiction and I will protect them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in an intercept course for the Romulanship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelledthere. No, the Iconians were certainly real. Sit down. We know thatthree systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities. Similarities which could only be explained by there being a singleunifying influence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how much time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And assemble the bridge staff for a mission briefing in fifteenminutes. Picard out. Mister Elbrun. Would you <eos> <bos> PICARD: Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course zero three seven mark zero zero five, warp four. Take us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mute main viewer. Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we could still see each other. People do. We could arrangeshore leave together. And, for the future, who knows? <eos> <bos> PICARD: From where? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Comments. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick itup. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention Ferengistarship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. In thename of the United Federation of Planets, I demand you return the T9energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri Four. Send that in alllanguage forms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had this feeling I had physically leftthe Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewherein the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am aware of Federation regulations, sir, and if youinvestigate them further, you will find the captain decides ifextradition is warranted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It wouldn't do any harm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise. Code fourteen. Lock on present coordinates. Twosecond delay. Mark! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried tokill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good histhreat against the boy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you located the science team, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Ferengi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. But I would prefer more recent intelligence on theexact layout of the installation. The most current information we haveis two years old. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're destroying yourself and anyone who is foolish enoughto listen to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I can muddle my way through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you changed the colour of your eyes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I met him once, many years ago, very briefly at his son'swedding. I can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant,standing in the presence of such history. I remember he spoke to me andI just stood there grinning like an idiot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister Worf. I want you to time the Doctor and methrough that first tunnel. And this time we're going to pick up thosefive seconds. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As beforePICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, he admits his mistake in falsifying his application. Thatdoes not make him a traitor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Enough. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all. That's the last thing I would do. You, bydefinition, are part of our charter. Our mission is to go forth to seekout new and different life forms, and you certainly qualify as one ofthe most unique I've ever encountered. To learn about you is, frankly,provocative. But you're next of kin to chaos. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any hallucinations, nightmares? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, escort Commander Riker from the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's continue this discussion in private. Number One, you havethe Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try hailing it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, our task is to eliminate from the ship's records anyinformation that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get towork. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As have yours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Debin, hold this position. Viewer off. Data, identify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I met him once. What I know of him comes from history books,and of course my mind meld with his father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought of asking for a volunteer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's alone. For the first time he's being forced to cope withhis environment without the resources of the Collective. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The odds are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By my programme as well, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. There's just one last thing you can do for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If your intent is to intimidate, you are not succeeding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Ready phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the bad news? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. And Mister Data, thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have been looking over the glyphs and pictograms from theCalder Two artefact. And although I don't have enough data to translateall the inscriptions, the alphabet and symbology is much moreconsistent with early Vulcan than Romulan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We have toproceed very carefully. So the first task is to test Mister Data'shypothesis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment, Mister Data. Admiral, this is Picard. May I knowthe reason for this communication? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know what the devil you're talking about. But whateverit is, I assure you it's no concern of mine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That may not be possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to. Wesley. Wesley Crusher, come in! <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're looking for DaiMon Solok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er,um, married? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hopefully he'll tell us, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A product for which you have no use, but which the Ornaranscan't live without. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, sir, I'm not prepared to leave until your affairsare completed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they receiving us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On your feet, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor, Mister La Forge.  PICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel message. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker conducts masterclasses in poker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Always, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Given the importance of the data, I think that it's worth therisk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, how long will it take us to search this system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin emergency evacuation. Stand by for saucer separation,Mister La Forge, can you remove the charge from the engine core? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, I came to alert you that theRekags and the Seronians are in disagreement about the seatingarrangements at the conference table. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The breach never happens. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers fromBynaus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid, Data. Splendid. You're getting better and better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There must be a lava flow or a underground hot spring somewherenear here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp three, evasive. Stand by. Disengage weapons and shields. Re-engage modified beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We haveto get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to crossthe border? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that would be more in character, wouldn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, hurry! <eos> <bos> PICARD: She has your full confidence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, these are questions that mankind has been struggling withthroughout history. Your confusion is only human. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riva, Commander Data has learned your sign language. Talk tous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problemto worry about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she still in one piece? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll be taken to the nearest starbase and held responsiblefor the attack on the Enterprise, and possibly the deaths of eleventhousand people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister La Forge. You proceed with yourinvestigation, but I want you to report to Doctor Crusher for a bioscanat the start of day watch. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You still haven't answered my question, Sarek. Is it logicalfor a Vulcan to cry? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it seems you have more knowledge of the situation than I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How different? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may findthe solution within its pages. Ah. 'It was a dark andstormy night'. It's not a promising beginning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get to it, Tomalak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos> <bos> PICARD: As are we. For what it's worth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you should join me in my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Terms accepted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have underFarpoint, Groppler. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. But let us put this to rest as quickly as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring us about, Ensign. Maximum shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Although an object appears solid on the holodeck, in the realworld they have no substance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An unfortunate reality. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One day. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

And be careful, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That there is room for discussion, Radue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's alive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. It's a classified matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something more, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the tremors have frightened people, leading to this hysteriaover Ardra, let us reassure them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On this latest incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you and Commander Data made any progress in finding ameans of communication? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's typical of theta-band emissions. You have to compressthe detection band width in order to determine the fix. The sourceemission is five hundred metres east of here. And seven hundred metresbelow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, advise Doctor Clark that the hostages are beingreleased. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I intruding? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's go see your patient, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for Gagarin Four, warp seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell him I'm looking forward to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're living, sentient beings. Their rights and privileges inour society have been defined. I helped define them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were found in crates marked Medical Supplies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it be Lore? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's perfectly understandable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the sperm whale on Earth devours millions of cuttlefishas it roams the oceans. It is not evil. It is feeding. The same may betrue of the Crystalline Entity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Every ship that enters theDemilitarised Zone is being searched. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Doctor, how do we kill them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were alltogether on the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transfer helm to Engineering, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. I accept. Captain's log, supplemental. K'mpec, who ruled theKlingon Empire longer than anyone in history, is dead. We await thearrival of Duras and Gowron, rivals for the leadership of the HighCouncil. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are you feeling all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let her go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Depends. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When you're ready, coordinate with Mister Data. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what I told him. But we have to be careful. Obviouslyit's easy for people to misunderstand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sophistry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We both know that's not true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to hiscaptivity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Download the files to my Ready room. I'll study them there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a lock on her signal once she's aboard. At the first sign of trouble I want to be able to bring her back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Now perhaps you can tell me what was so importantthat it required depriving the Captain of his cup of Earl Grey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assure him that we are doing everything possible. And, advisehim that if necessary I will defend my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, gentlemen. Forgive this intrusion. I was justpassing by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. You know, Geordi, I spent the better part of my lifeexploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of newspecies. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves. Now it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thingthat I hold most dear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodbye, Jono. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a fuel containment leak? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, how would she react to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open. What crimes are you referring to? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you will come with me right now. Do you understandme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching theValo system on the outskirts of Cardassian territory, where manyBajorans have resettled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand one of these devices successfully repaired afaulty power grid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a futile effort. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nonsense. It is only <eos> <bos> PICARD: Comfortable? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's see if anyone's out there. Mister Worf, attempt a widerange sensor sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now would be a good time, Mister O'Brien. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you clean that up, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, who is real here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have a few hours. I told you, this cell is alreadybeginning to degenerate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. Captain's log, supplemental. We're en route to theFederation Research station on Gagarin Four. The mere thought of apossible connection between the Lantree tragedy and a genetic researchfacility fills me with profound apprehension. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He also believes that you're a less than perfect Starfleetofficer. Will, I want you to play into that role. Baran and I, well, hedoesn't care very much for me, but he has to tolerate me because heneeds my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies,then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well played, Counsellor. May I have a word with you for justa moment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I recognise that you're trying to satisfy my conditions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I amthe Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: His visit is not just an inspection of Lal's progress. He hasexpressed a concern for her environment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will continue with Riker as Captain. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fascinating, Data, absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs. Troiwould love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition ofbrown dwarf stars. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is a self-induced catatonic state. Their way of dealing withthe trauma of spaceflight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you're here to learn about the human condition and thereis no better way of doing that than by embracing Shakespeare. But youmust discover it through your own performance, not by imitating others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our only influence, Minister, is by example. Timicin's decisionis his own free will, I assure you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Since the military took over hundreds of thousands more havedied. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you know all this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Doctor. Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe if we put some distance between us, that might weaken it. Not that I'm growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform DoctorCrusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You heard me, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you find anything that might suggest why you're apparentlythe only one among us unaffected by this, this phenomenon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: To each his own, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Surprised? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, check hull and shield integrity for any sign ofintruders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you build one? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the others? Including the victim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, one to beam up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All the life. Perhaps the Professor's number blocks hadsomething to do with organic matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand back, Haro. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life form? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, what is going on? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners arefaulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. All right, let's proceed on the premise that what we havejust seen happened, and that in less than four hours from now, theEnterprise will be destroyed, and somehow, although this isunfathomable, I and I alone escape. Discussion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any change in the anomaly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher has requested to remain on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I, er, I hope we can be friends? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need more speed than that, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Conor, I believe that you and I should talk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Proconsul says that he is prepared toendorse peace talks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you have the helm. I'll be inEngineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what's the date? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's only four. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is responsible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, you will lead the away team over to the scout. Commander, you and Counsellor Troi will conduct Setal's interrogation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, a great deal actually. My father was a strong believer inpassing on the traditions and history of the family. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel is approaching. It will be herewithin three hours. We can return you to the crash site, where theywill find you and take then you home. Or, if you wish, you can stayhere with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's launch a probe into it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers Ihave no idea what's underneath. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In fact, the programme is continuing even now inside that cube. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's their way, Lieutenant. Do they have our coordinates? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to see him right now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my years as a Starship Captain, I've had to notify manyparents of the loss of loved ones, but never before a suicide. I wouldlike to be able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's parents some explanation ofwhat happened, to try to help them make sense of this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attention all hands. As you know, we could outrun the Klingonvessels, but we must protect the Enterprise-C until she enters thetemporal rift. And we must succeed. Let's make sure history neverforgets the name Enterprise. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, I don't wish to appear rude, but I am not seekingjamaharon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand that. But Ineed to know more. You must tell me more about Darmok and Jalad. Tellme. You used the words, 'Temba, his arms wide' when you gave me theknife and the fire. Could that mean give? Temba, his arms wide. Darmok. Give me more about Darmok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps this Morag was the one who was interested in obtainingthe encrypted messages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're nearly there. Can you continue? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is an emergency. We need warp drive. How long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: To lose sixteen years. It's almost beyondbelief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which Commander Data is following. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was murdered. Poisoned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does it work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would be inappropriate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: First impressions? He's a thoughtful man. Informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, how? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that once you were a peaceful people with a richspiritual life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, do you remember what happened? You were abductedduring the mission to Tilonus Four. You were put into a psychiatrichospital. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have afew years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do notwant to be patronised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying there was some conscious mind at work here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My appreciation, madam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think you are affected, sir, far more than you realise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you for a delicious meal. We must do this againsometime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security alert, condition three. Computer, shut down alltransporter systems and shuttlebays. Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Doctor? Good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Uh huh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me the sign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to returnwith us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinityof Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the defence system Mrs. Manheim spoke of? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are our orders? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Estimated distance to the nebula'sperimeter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some kind of coercive device? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's your assessment of our potential effectiveness? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now please, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not very hungry. I really came for the view. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask the Admiral some questions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't have to. They already knew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, your former Commander, a Federation Captain, isabout to place me in the position of firing on his ship. I need yourknowledge of the man. How he thinks, what he's capable of doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have much time. It's good to seeyou, Will. I didn't expect to meet you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might haveshared our kind of values. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've told you everything I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you haven't told us the whole story. How it ended. The partabout Rishon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Run a comparison using basic simple words from Dinasian, Dewanand Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've been monitoring your progress toward warp-drivecapability. When a society reaches your level of technology and isclearly about to initiate warp travel, we feel the time is right forfirst contact. We prefer meeting like this, rather than a randomconfrontation in deep space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Acceptable risks, justified risks, but I can't acceptthis. It's unjustified. It's unfair. He has rights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not you too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long do you need? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I'll go update my itinerary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unbelievable! You are out of your mind! The Sarthongians aremerciless to trespassers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator hasbeen able to achieve. To make another functioning, sentient, android. To make another Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have been trying to make sense of this gobbledygook, but it'sbeyond me. The fact is, my android officer, Data, is being transferredcompulsorily to be made part of a highly dangerous, ill-conceivedexperiment, and I want it stopped. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many outposts are there in this sector? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are these beingsPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify them? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I lied. Look, the Enterprise is scheduled to spend a weekundergoing maintenance overhaul at Starbase twelve. While there, Ipromise that I will make full use of available recreation activity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put out a repeating message on all subspace channels, priorityone communiqué. Break off your pursuit immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse power, full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate a metallurgical analysis of the ship's hull. Subspacefield incursions may have left a trace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two days? But that's not enough time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meeting adjourned, then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit othersystems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do yousend messages to other communities, to other places? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We could grant you asylum, Hugh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

We were just going to ask you the same thing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Horses? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no you're not. It's just that Commander Riker came totalk to me this afternoon. About you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But how is that possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam two from theJenolen as soon as we're within range. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Those are some fairly aggressive computations, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're not involved in this decision, boy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue a full sensor sweep. I want all the information we cangather. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish you well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it you want? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we were not unconscious for a full day. Everything onboard indicates that we were out for thirty seconds. The ship'schronometer, the computer, everything, Doctor, including CommanderData. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, you never may become fully human, but you've had anexperience that transcends the human condition. You have been an entirecivilisation. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

No, of course you're right. We must not get involved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is Miss Brianon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The shoot-out between the bellboy and Mickey D. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you wouldbe demanding equal levels of representation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't befair to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormholedidn't permanently damage the sensors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then do so, and let the Bridge know that all is well down here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it afew hours ago. All the crew members were dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Options? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll have an answer shortly. Lock on tractor beam, Mister LaForge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This has nothing to do with ship's business, Number One. Suffice it to say, it is strictly a matter of image. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you think it would be unwise to letEndar see Jono? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your mother? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, programme the computer to analyse the distribution ofthe pieces that we have, correcting for changes in star configurationsover four billion years, then extrapolate for the missing piece. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will take this to Starfleet myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I do appreciate your caution. I share it. Bringhis vessel into the shuttlebay. Place it under guard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. If it's energy that you want, we have other waysof providing it. You needn't destroy us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The women. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. The meeting is adjourned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'll operate the transporter controls myself. If she'sgoing to be consigned to oblivion, then <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's be very observant. Even the mostinsignificant image could be a very important symbol. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll tell you why not. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ro is on that ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay with Q. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll accept the judgement of history. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf is my Chief of Security and my tacticalofficer. This matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A penalty box? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I haven't as yet, Number One. I didn't think it was myresponsibility alone. His remaining will create difficulties for usall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why must Sakkath help to contain your emotions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to know the root of your prejudice for my First Officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are the engines operating normally? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Thank you. Picard out. Our comm. badges must be locked intothe simulation. If that had been the real Commander Riker, he wouldhave given my location as holodeck three. Mister La Forge, will youexcuse us, please? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, Data. At least you're functioning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done. Mister Worf, coordinate your teams with DoctorCrusher and Commander La Forge. Assess damage and injury. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. So she advised this council? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. TheEnterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go,they won't attack you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the same Bridge. Nothing has changed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. What about a shuttle? We could send it down through oneof these fissures. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the rest of us may lose consciousness. If we do,it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! Where is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I already have a hell of a first officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're to be presented with evidence today. We'll need your helpin analysing it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, begin a level one diagnostic. All transportersystems offline until further notice. Could they have materialisedsomewhere else? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in thestructural alloys which allows us to trace our material. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sometimes, Number One, you just have to bow to the absurd. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe we've met. The Altairian conference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have they been delayed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or trusted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you read me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll relieve you at zero three zero zero. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The other reason being? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't do that. If we send that ship back with new technologywe will be altering the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No one is could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I neverthought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth Dynasty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You saw what that thing was about to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We thought you were at risk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you can explain why his craft is threatening toattack us unless I give him custody of you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, at your convenience, I would like to talk toyou in my Ready room. Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, I imagine a very similar discussion taking place onour neighbour ship over a thousand years ago. Let's hope our decisionsare more successful than theirs were. Mister La Forge, I want you toreturn to Engineering and continue with your efforts without delay. Mister Worf, prepare the phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, he's in our highest security detention area. Thereshouldn't be any more problems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Human? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I shouldn't be taking this trip at all. I should be back onboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, why did you do it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I'll take this opportunity to remove my ears. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you must realise that something hashappened to you. The Data I know would never have agreed to be awilling party to Lore's plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was an errand of mercy. He was injured, Doctor Crusherdecided for humanitarian reasons to care for him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Jarok has provided me with thelocations, strengths and tactical plans of the Romulan fleet. Mister La Forge, he is prepared to give you data regarding engines,weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird classstarship. But I believe his experience as a field commander will bemore valuable for its strategic sense than in the technical areas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain this course, Ensign. Three quarters impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, there'll be a memorial service at twenty threehundred hours this evening. Mister Data is making arrangements. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What wereyou saying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you remember that folk melody I playedfor you this morning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would log that agreement as promising, at least. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reduce to impulse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that, Data. Look, I realise you've been studying thehuman equation with great alacrity, but perhaps you've been working atit too much. Don't try so hard to be human. Just be yourself. Allright? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll take care. Find out what you can, then join me, in forceif necessary. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll just have to trust me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is La Forge still down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, that's takes care of this ward. Time to be moving on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, it does. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would be like striking a spark in a gas-filled room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: These are specialists, highly trained observation teams,superficially identical to yourselves and therefore able to blendnaturally into your society. You see, we have discovered that the mosthazardous aspect of these missions is a lack of sufficient information <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and thensuddenly to be here, right in front of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions. We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And one more full day for their answer to return. I'd like thetruth on this by then. I'd hate to have to prepare a formal defence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I suppose a few moments longer. I'm afraid I can't helpyou, Mister Leech. The game is over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. I'm afraid there will be no autopsy. The family hasalready been contacted. They insist that the body must not be toucheduntil they perform the Ferengi death ritual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: at warp factor eight? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vash. How did you get in here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In plain English, you're saying the dilithium is causing thegeological catastrophe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your candour, but despite your condition there isno one better equipped to deal with these Romulans than you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! That was very foolish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: God? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, I want you to command the Excalibur. Her crew wasreassigned when she put in for repairs. Geordi, you will be his FirstOfficer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know what could? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it wasn't a dream. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you believe he's using the same tactic now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed when ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the Enterprise has been delayed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it be telepathic? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I understand from Mister La Forge there's a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will comply when I have determined the cause of thedestruction of the Yamato, and when I am fully satisfied that you werenot responsible. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are excused, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, they're already underway. I have an announcement for theentire Bridge. As many of you suspected, when our ship passed throughthe edge of this, it accidentally carried away a sentient being. Muchlike these energy patterns we're seeing here. A terrifying experiencefor anyintelligent being. As if a great claw had reached down and scooped oneof you from your home world. Drawn into the energy circuits of thisvessel, it found its way to you, Worf. Frantic at being carried fromits home world, and recognising you as sentient beings, it pleaded forhelp, but in ways youcouldn't understand. Desperately going from person to person, and thendiscovering the computer intelligence in this ship's memory circuits. Oh, simplistic intelligence, but it furnished it enough to slow thisEnterprise thing that had captured it. And it very much regrets theaccidental death of Engineer Singh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any suggestions, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting this is somehow contagious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you done to him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possessintelligence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Advise him to set his coordinates for the Delta Quadrant. Hemay run into them in eighty years or so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The crew is saddened by your loss, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently, not when to duck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Plot an intercept course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim atrisk. I want every possible security measure taken to protect thatperson. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How could the Romulans plant a bomb onboard a Klingon attack cruiser? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, if what you say is true, then this is not GeordiLa Forge. Are you certain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Didn't you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It appears to be the same effect that you described in us. Doyou remember anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. It is important that you trust us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief MedicalOfficer I want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whose lives? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A wormhole? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop at next level. Computer, acknowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, it's going to be far more difficult where we'regoing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is an M-class planet in this system. Can we reach it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Crusher, all stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was following orders to take this ambassador to a locationnear the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not a person, damn it, it's a Borg! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I would not. Computer, display an internal schematicdiagram. <eos> <bos> PICARD: court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamedof it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with thatline from Shakespeare. Kill all thelawyers. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Absolutely not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, respectfully. I would appreciate consulting rights onthe assignment of a new officer, especially one with the record of RoLaren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other wayto scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in anormal sensor sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, we're all doing the best we can in a difficultsituation. Think nothing more of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All it'll do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not agood idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A toast. To the young couple and their families. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you care for some coffee, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: World, not galaxy. All the world's a stage. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, won't you sit down? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about his file, Lieutenant Yar? Could he have accomplishedthe reprogramming that Data says took place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had hoped you would not throw away a promising career. Iunderstand your loss, We all admired K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will appearon your record. Dismissed. Mister Worf, isn't it time for the truthabout your father's innocence to be told? After all, you only acceptedthis dishonour to protect the name of Duras and hold the Empiretogether. Now that he has died in disgrace, what is gained by furthersilence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Receptacles? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless that was the mistake. Staying too long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's more serious than that. I think the mortality fail-safemay have been circumvented. He could've killed me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't need to see the records. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, she's fine, fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findingswith the Federation Astrophysical Survey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've stopped the bleeding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break throughit. I want that man on this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That may be so, but it's not my decision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, security override request. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We mean you no harm. Do you believe me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about all the people in that world who are totallydependant on their computer? Are they still functioning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, target phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And so the question becomes not who, since it clearly was oneof the three remaining terraformers. The question becomes why? What arethey hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them, couldbe desperate enough to kill? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What I didn't put in the report was that at the end he gave mea choice between a life of comfort or more torture. All I had to do wasto say that I could see five lights, when in fact, there were onlyfour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good morning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom. I'velearned to trust it. I could arrange for you to speak with her if youwish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I should have listened to her. She told me someone was tryingto kill her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are they in working condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would it surprise you to learn that he found them equallyvaluable? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind usthan I am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I came here to talk to Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I'd like to talk to you for a moment about my futureon the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wondrous, yes, but not miraculous. The doors merely workdifferently from the ones you know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain La Forge has disappeared along with the rest of hercrew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which, for a few hours, should provide the emotional controlyou need. In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude thetreaty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's over, Sovak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It means almost certain death for you, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Prime Directive forbids us to interfere with the socialorder of any planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask youthat. But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, andyou know what happened to them. What will happen to them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To seek and destroy a metagenic weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's been tried. No response. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not yet, Mister Worf. This is just a tap on the shoulder, or wewouldn't be here talking about it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you recognised him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room. Lock into this signal. Stand by forsix to beam up. Wesley, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not under these circumstances. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data. A wise man once said, there is a sucker bornevery minute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security to Captain's quarters immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're suggesting he created the problem just to solve it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're describing the situation on this ship. But CounsellorTroi reported nightmares. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we navigate around these fragments? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Timicin. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So did I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're talking about restoring the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Prepare to launch a classfour probe to study the energy field. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. They were sealed off more than a century ago. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. I think we must not lose sight of the fact thatwe're talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank. Even though she may appear somewhat eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must betreated with the appropriate respect. Is that understood? Picard toPulaski. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? What are youseeing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if that presumption is correct, then we could havesustained other damage. Um, Computer, status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have the means. But first I must see my people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Commander. Tactical analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something interesting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resuming previous course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of here, Mister Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, due to the delicate nature of these negotiations, allparties have agreed that one representative would suffice. Now I willbe happy to provide your consuls with accommodations and you may havemy chair. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I've had a few years to look it up. Professor, theEnterprise is yours for as long as you're here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beginning braking manoeuvre. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have the information you requested. Colonel Stephen Richeywas the commanding officer of the explorer ship Charybdis <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just what is the evidence against myofficer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you're right, because he and I were friends for yearsafter this. I mean, I hope we will be. You know, you keep smiling atme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Stay awake. Come on. There's a lot of blood. What do I do next? Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. MisterData, how many people on the Enterprise are from non-Federationplanets? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has not regained consciousness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stop engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it certainly hasn't been abandoned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker, with the peace delegates and all, I think I do need arest. Take charge, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Wyatt seems a fine young man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay with him, Counsellor. We're examining the Brittain forclues, but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, let me remind you we are on a mission ofexploration. Our purpose is to establish peaceful relations with thecivilisations we encounter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When you were here last, you were saying that you were feelingtired. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As I understand it, over time they have become sointerconnected with the master computer on their planet that theirlanguage, their thought patterns have become as close to binary as it'spossible for organic beings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: History has shown us that strength may be useless when facedwith terrorism. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are six years old. Weak and helpless. You cannothurt me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father'ssin. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime wasto lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But youshould not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of thatlie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don'thave the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not muchof an actor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, if you were dying, if you were terminally ill with an incurable disease and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain, wouldn't you come to look on death as a release? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your Honour, I appreciate your indulgence. Allow me to explain. A team from the Enterprise has taken control of this woman's ship nowin orbit around Ventax Two. Thank you for your help, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll meet you in the lobby in fifteen minutes. Be punctual. Oh,and I advise you to change your clothing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle ofnon interference. As Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath touphold that principle whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I mustrefuse your request. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Such as my reporting this incident to your superiors who mayquestion your competency asDaiMon? I will think about it. Screen off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So their only choice was to transfer all the stored informationand shut down until after it passed. And then reactivate their systemand transfer the information back to this main computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, no. It was Ensign Ro's idea but I fully endorsed it. I suspected that something like this might occur. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What went wrong? You know, don't you? What did you do? Whathappened? Why did you leave the ship? Don't turn away. Look at me. Picard! Look at me! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here we are again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how do you explain Starfleet's report that the same testson the Ajax and on the Fearless over there, resulted in ameasurable increase in propulsion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask fortransport away from here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, Iexpect a better explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find it hard to believe that you are doing this for thebenefit of my soul. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is it at all likely that the Vico could have beenattacked inside the cluster? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Doctor. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll inform you of my decision shortly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Troi. Troi, we must talk. I believe it's possible tooutmanoeuvre this creature, and beam you and Ben back up to the ship. We've been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle. Whenthe creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Always. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Ship's Counsellor,Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's talk about that later, shall we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Welcome home, Mister Data. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that by not cooperating, you are actuallyprotecting us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold for my order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I have every reason to believe that they will resistany attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergencysession of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must bereopened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a treatment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you want someone to accompany you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can you tap into their computer and clarify thesituation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number fourseven eight B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can we help you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that the Romulans are just hoping to create adistraction. They want to keep us off balance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide,Commander Wrightwell, and he said that you were particularly fond ofthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you care to dance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll go along with that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death and howDoctor Crusher brought her back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Their raids have made this sector unsafe. They've ransacked ourresearch facilities, our trade routes have been disrupted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hopeso. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've just come from a meeting with AdmiralMoore. He wanted to discuss this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be interested tosee the results. Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would suggest you ask your friend the Cardassian liaison,Admiral. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassiansstaged it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan. Lookthis isn't a Romulan labour camp. I don't have to answer yourquestions. And I don't give a damn what you think. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did he seem then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Conor, we were unaware that there were human colonies inthis system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander MacDuff, have the other officers listed here reportto the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may test that assumption at your convenience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitudecontrol and most systems are offline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And be Wesley Crusher's room mate? I will admit thatreturning to the Academy does have a certain appeal, but I've spent mylife looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like lookingbackward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour intodogma. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The rest of this is an issue, gentlemen, to be settled betweenyourselves. Now if you will excuse us, we have business. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let's just say I've heard rumours that the Uthat islocated somewhere on Risa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us,and we ask that you now please return her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're getting closer to tracing their movements. Actually, itwas Wesley who put us onto this dimensional jump of theirs. He has beenextraordinary, Beverly. He's going to make a very fine officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open the frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. We look forward to seeing you, Admiral. Enterpriseout. Quinn wants to see us alone. At least we know he's still on ourside. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! I'm not talking about parenting. I am talking about theextraordinary consequences of creating new life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But why? What possible advantage could there be to theRomulans? As this now stands, I don't think this will have any impacton our strategy. We'll continue the blockade, leave the next move tothem. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can recognise the inscription pattern from the firstartefact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've arrived safely, Number One, but sofar we've been ignored. I'll keep you informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing freq. Why are we gaining on them? Don'tanticipate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with mystaff. Stand by for further communications. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standing by, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when the away team arrived early he must have been worriedthat Starfleet was becoming suspicious. He needed more time to finishhis work. Apgar said that each of the three versions. No doubt, he wasafraid that Commander Riker mightlearn the truth and cut off his support prematurely. DiscoveringCommander Riker with his wife didn't help matters. I submit that he decided to murder Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Being the only Klingon ever to serve in Starfleet gave you asingular distinction, but I felt that what was unique about you wasyour humanity, compassion, generosity, fairness. You took the bestqualities of humanity and made them part of you. The result was a manwho I was proud to call one of my officers. I'll have your belongingstransported to the Bortas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Options, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thrilling. That was absolutely thrilling. And I was right, Number One. There were ghosts aboard that old ship. One of them actually spoke to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've known one another for years. Tell me what you believe iswrong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you this is an informal inquiry. We are not accusingyou of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be providedfor you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Abort it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not surprised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must select an officer to replace Data at Ops. Recommendations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, can you get us out of this star systemsafely? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is either populated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Everything under control, Ensign Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono? You all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Stay as long as you wish. No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're aware of the risks, Mister O'Brien? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle to be thrownback in time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any signs of other Klingon vessels? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador! <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is your status with him now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As soon as the last of the colony is evacuated, I want thoseperimeter teams out of there. Is that understood? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let's hope they're in a mood to talk. Hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't do this, this, this you do with men. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, notify Security to prepare a detention cell. Bridge to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leaving school? No, you're not. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is my sworn duty to protect you. The Enterprise will remainin orbit around Rana Four as long as the two of you are alive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, one does not always have the luxury <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would argue that the Crystalline Entity has as much right tobe here as we do. Now, Commander Data has some theories on how we mightcommunicate. Please confer with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've only had a chance to glance at them. I've a few ideas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anti-time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've never seen anything like her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're saying they. It is a vessel of some sort. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you finished? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this the forty six? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you report it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will await your signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue phaser fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here. Iwant to reassure you that we have no hostile intention. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just a few moments. You saw the Admiral on the Enterprise whenhe was en route to Mordan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And this is the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect theEdo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your rights? What about Rishon? Is she in favour of being hereleft here? Come to the Enterprise. Let me take you where you'll besafe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue transmitting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were right, Tallera. The resonator cannot be stopped byphasers and shields, but it can be defeated by peace. Captain's log, stardate 47169.2. Security MinisterSatok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest ofthe isolationists. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Capsule? People? What people? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the doors will open automatically when the launch begins. And I will override. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All set, Chief? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying it's attack on Yar was not arbitrary but part ofsome tactic? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For three years, since stardate 41124. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a mission. It's personal. It's between Q andmyself. I don't want the rest of you involved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is his special nature. He learned the lessons of humanitywell. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must say, you're looking remarkably well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am less than an hour away from a battle simulation, and Ihave to hand-hold an android. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caughton a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thirties? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Qab jIH nagil <eos> <bos> PICARD: A cloaking device? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me makeit again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless theyare prepared to do battle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And in the hands of a con artist, fear can be used to motivateobedience, capitulation, the exploitation of innocent people. And thatis what I believe has happened here. I intend to prove that. I need tofind a loophole, some way of challenging the validity of this contract. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sir, I see no way to protect the Cardassian peace withoutsacrificing the Bajorans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cargo One. This should be an interestingexperience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he? Are you sure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire another volley directly into their field, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I won't do it. I won't alter history. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll wait a bit more, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What woman? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's find out. Computer, discontinue holodeck simulationcreated by Professor Moriarty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. There are one hundred and three members of thescience team on Ligos Seven. We should prepareshuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers ofcasualties. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they going to die? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Telepaths? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If it was the probe, that explains theYamato. But how do you account for the difficulties the Enterprise isexperiencing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They started out together. It seems only fitting they shouldend up together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ask for her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inform them the transfer will take place shortly. Picard out. Mister Data, to the Bridge please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have it, Mister Lynch. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transfer emergency power to the antimattercontainment system! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Someone left this junction box open. I thought your crewwas supposed to be off the ship once the field diverters were in place. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is quite unnecessary, Doctor. I'm fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inspector, Inspector, this is hearsay. She wasn't a witness tothis incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've never before seen the Lieutenant so unsettled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I shall need you. You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have developed new defence capabilities since our lastmeeting and we are prepared to use them if you do not withdraw fromFederation space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: His dependence. Beverly, look, he's seventeen years old. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodbye Mrs. Troi, and thank you. Energise, Chief O'Brien. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can scan the interior? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Correction, Number One. Knowing the decision you face, I havepermitted you this gathering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We know about the transporter malfunction and that you areholding Ambassador T'Pel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She is an Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but if Solok were to go to Celtris Three for legitimatereasons, we would be interested in quietly booking passage for thejourney. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your people prepare a warm welcome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, you will accompany the Doctor to the surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No names, no reason. Can you identify them, Vigo? If they comein a second time with our shields damaged <eos> <bos> PICARD: The good news. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long until they begin to coalesce? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you also realise that you would most likely be stripped downto your wires to find out what the hell has gone wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, there is no one on this ship with more knowledge of theCrystalline Entity than Commander Data. He originated on Omicron Theta. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes sleep. Sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not very good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A dare devil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concernsme is that you participated in acover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of acadet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: About space. About the universe you are preparing to enter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Academy must make you wait, that's true. But, when I reviewyour service to this ship, your crewmates, I cannot in all consciencemake you wait for the Academy. You see, Wesley, in my eyes you're anacting ensign in title only. I hereby grant you field promotion to fullEnsign, with all the commensurate responsibilities and privileges ofthat rank. Congratulations. You're dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they were brought here by whoever created thatmake-believe world down there. It's possible they didn't know howfragile the humans aboard actually were. Only one of them survived. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Progress, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised theprisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you breakyour own rules. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not made anymore. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last twodays here on this starship, not on Boraal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're going to intercept that ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there no hope for Brevelle or Mendez? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still, there are some points that I'm not very clear about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: According to this we're already well past the point at which weentered the void. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can you tell us about him, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If this is Q I'm addressing, we are on a mission of rescuewhere a group of badly injured Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Curiouser and curiouser. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a confession givenby me, Jean-Luc Picard commanding Stargazer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to end the suffering of one of my crewmembers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Five hundred kph. Ensign. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Walker! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me go! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get him out of there! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And then watch what happens. Captain's log, supplemental. I have becomeconvinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy. I am hopefulthe purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You flatter me Professor, but I can't help but wonder whatcould possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of yourstudy. Even in this decade, there are far wiser and more experiencedhumans in and out of Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet youknew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct thatis uncivilised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship's computer <eos> <bos> PICARD: This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you backout now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We'recommitted to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carryout your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for havinglied to me about this operation. I would certainly have youcourt-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: So why do you now live in huts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll be underway as soon as our enginesare online. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please don't look on it like that. We have done everythingwe can to explain these comas. We have performed physical examinations,and neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic,looking for viruses, parasites, infestations. We have investigatedevery possible cause we can imagine. We have found nothing. Nothing toexplain these comas. The only variable that we have not been able toeliminate is your presence here on this ship. Now, in the light of ouractions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Ambassador Odan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not my time. I don't belong here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any waywe can protect him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Necheyev, welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. It's just that you are the fifth woman to ask me thatquestion this morning. All I require is to sit in the sun and read mybook. Alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, you're sound of mind and body. If you are properlybriefed, you will still be able to fulfill your duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hmm? What? Oh, er, France. Labarre. My home village. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Steady as she goes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not amused, Number One. There must be some way to convinceher that it's quite impossible, without offending her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Ambassador. Number One, set a course one three zero marktwo four six, warp seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Humans can't survive in that environment. Exposure to hyperonicradiation is fatal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forbid it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. he does not. I'm here to rest and spend some time with myfamily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher to Bridge, urgent. They mustnot be permitted them to destroy us. Or the planet. Captain's log, supplemental. It has been believedthe Tarellian race was extinct, an assumption contradicted now by thesight of one of their vessels approaching Haven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to himnow? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So long as Moriarty has control of the ship, we are vulnerable. Somehow, I have to find a way of giving him what he wants. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolisedby a sun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How the hell are we going to get it out of there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing onTilonian culture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And yet you claim that it is possible, that you're the daughterof Tasha Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I don't think so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. Mister Worf,channel all available power to the structural integrity fields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Another malfunction? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. It is urgent that you respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami, may I speak with you in private? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes I would, and should. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is the differences that have made us strong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want something that will really help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand down Red alert, but keep tracking their movement,Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. He is more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A prodigy? In what sense? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like that. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up withsome explanation for your abduction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data, is there anything else that Lorecan tell us about it, it may be important. Can you control him enoughto question him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. I can imagine you would be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find outone way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Another moment and <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran every word that I've said. He knows that Idon't think much of him as a leader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No doubt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare am away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Earth was once a violent planet, too. At times, the chaosthreatened the very fabric of life, but, like you, we evolved. We foundto find better ways to handle our conflicts. But I think no one candeny that the seed of violence remains within each of us. We mustrecognise that, because that violence is capable of consuming each ofus. As it consumed your son. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Just her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're familiar with this life form? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's entirely my fault, Marie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other andigniting their plasma trails. One of the most spectacular and difficultdemonstrations of precision flying. It hasn't been performed at theAcademy team in over a hundred years. Do you know why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be inthat escape pod, or what happened to the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think we can handle the situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No time. No time to argue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'm going down to the planet myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's too close to be a coincidence. Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now that you have had a taste of captivity, perhaps youwill reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others. In anyevent, we now know about your race and we know how to imprison you. Bear that in mind. Now get off my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. Butnow his memory will live on in his namesake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please don't interrupt me, Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sounds a little like a young lieutenant commander I oncerecruited as a first officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is this first step that Pardek suggests? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. I do. First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6. TheEnterprise is nearing Qualor Two, home of a Federation surplus depotoperatedby the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector arrayended up in the hands of the Ferengi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were married to my best friend. At first I thought it washarmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: True enough. It's a gamble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise C? She was lost at the battle of Narendra Three,defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is all I ask. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Including questionnaires, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is possible she was an eyewitness to your father'sactivities on Khitomer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss theBradbury. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Mister McDowell, will you set course for GaradiusFour and engage at <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know why we have to do this every year. I thought thatlast year the teachers had agreed that they wouldn't do this anymore. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who's the captain of this ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you make contact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is imperative that you hold yourposition until we finish evacuating the colony. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're mad. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, we will leave. It is not our policy to intervene inthe affairs of other cultures. But before I return the survivor to you,I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of what he has done tomerit a death sentence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why does it have to be me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's possible. But if that is an archive from some ancientcivilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful. Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in anydanger, I want you to sever the connection immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'Tal, this Council knows the law of heredity well. G'now jukHol pajhard. A son shall share in the honours or crimes of his father. Toral is Duras' son. That has been established by the genetic scan. Butwith due respect to the traditions and laws of this High Council, thereis no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who hasfought no battles, shed no blood for his people, or earned no honourfor himself. One day, perhaps he shall. But not now. Duras is dead. Hisclaim to the leadership died with him. Gowron shall lead the Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here's to the finest crew in Starfleet. You know, back when Iwas in the Academy, we would follow every toast with a song. I wonderif I can,oh, yes. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, the next few days will be difficultfor you <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are not invaders. We are explorers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates, set a course and engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard station orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now! Please, listen to me! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find it hard to believe that you're here to do us a favour. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jake! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than theenemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's our course? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, you are arguing for a man who may have murdered yourson. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: when the walls fell. First Officer's log, stardate 45048.8. Our attemptto transport Captain Picard back to the ship has failed. My options arenarrowing and my patience is all but gone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security to Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course, Doctor. Sit down. Counsellor. Commander La Forge isattempting repairs even as we speak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, you are now in Federation territory. Unless youwithdraw <eos> <bos> PICARD: And broken your leg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Replacing the burners. City ordinance. Makes it safer in caseof earthquake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot allow Maxwell to ambush that supply ship. Mister Worf,now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's sufficient to get to the Bridge. Once there, eitherwe'll get control of the ship and shut off the auto-destruct, or wewon't. This vessel must not fall into hostile hands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial rightnow. We need to find out who we are and well, what we're doing outhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then let's proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Neverthe less, this is an option we cannot neglect. We'llcontinue on other fronts as they present themselves. For now, let's seewhat she has to say. <eos> <bos> TROI: Timothy, perhaps you and I should go below and get out ofeveryone's way. <eos> <bos> TROI: There is life on board, but it's fading. <eos> <bos> TROI: And your Klingon side? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm proud of you, Reg. I'm glad for you, too. Well, I'd better begoing. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know how to describe it. I wassuddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic. And thesensations didn't seem to be coming from any person. They were justthere, in the room. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would help him find a way to secure our trust. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know it's not going to be easy, but I think it's important thatwe face up to what's happened. You're in command now. The crew'slooking to you for guidance. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. Because it's really none of your business. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: I sensed the same thing, Captain. He's hiding something. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can see that. Where are you going? <eos> <bos> TROI: There are two disparate personalities within Lieutenant CommanderData. Each distinctly different. A dominant and a recessive. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was holding you down? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no strangerthan what you're eating. Have you noticed howdry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls areset properly. <eos> <bos> TROI: One day you'll learn to be glad your father cared enough aboutyou to insist on rules. It may be hard to imagine right now, buteventually, most children come to appreciate their parents. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I'm a practicing psychologist. Maybe we can work inconcert. We are going to be together a long time. <eos> <bos> TROI: How do you feel now? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will he be with us? <eos> <bos> TROI: Exactly! <eos> <bos> TROI: Why do I think you're upset? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Take a break. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're feeling very vulnerable. Very mortal, if I may say so. Iknow you, Mother, and believe me, you will never be one of those whodies before they die. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, thank you for coming to talk to us. I'll see you later, allright? <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe not, sir. They seem mainly curious. In the case ofLutan, however, I did feel other needs. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you have to? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. Something is terribly wrong with Lal. <eos> <bos> TROI: I heard about Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. He was very mysterious. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. Ishould take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time I'll choosethe programme. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love LakeCataria on Betazed. <eos> <bos> TROI: What would you like? <eos> <bos> TROI: In many ways he's suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes toinvolve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called R'uustai, the Bonding <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna. <eos> <bos> TROI: He is a life force entity. When we passed each other in space, hewas curious about us, so he decided the best way to learn was to gothrough the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that wayto understand us. He never meant any harm. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps his reunification talks were successful. <eos> <bos> TROI: But he's not responding. <eos> <bos> TROI: Were you able to help Tasha? <eos> <bos> TROI: All the King's horses and all the King's Men, couldn'tput Humpty together again. <eos> <bos> TROI: So there was a trick. <eos> <bos> TROI: He should be in his quarters. You ordered him not to leave. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Yes, they are worried. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman. You thought that I would be this woman. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual. Wecan't be certain of that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sometimes it's healthy to explore the darker sides of the psyche. Jung called it owning your own shadow. This could be a sign that you'rea real actor. This is becoming more than just a role to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: You sent for me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: It should never have happened. I knew there was concern aboutoutside influences and I should have been more careful. <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your knowledge of us is unacceptable. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm still on Enterprise time. Aaron, I'm going back to the ship. I'm not going to see you again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Exactly. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not like Data to be so secretive. <eos> <bos> TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be theofficer's game at the Potemkin? <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me about her. I want to know everything. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

And worst part is, it'sgrowing. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Real. Not one of your perfectly synthesised, ingeniously enhancedimitations. I would like real chocolate ice cream, real whipped cream <eos> <bos> TROI: Military? He's a soldier ? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's feeding off the energy of the Enterprise as it would fromits mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, discontinue. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why are you so hard on yourself? <eos> <bos> TROI: But it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, then I have an advantage, don't I? I see her quite often. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now wait a minute. I don't understand <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't? No emotion at all? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there anything we can do to help? <eos> <bos> TROI: If Barclay is having difficulty facing reality, to suddenlydestroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could doconsiderable damage. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will. Captain's log, stardate 46073.6. We have arrivedwithout incident at Rekag-Seronia, where two members of AmbassadorAlkar's delegation have been waiting. They have joined us to report onthe situation in the capital city. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, do we have a link up to the Angosiancentral computer? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, how much <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, she's back. She's trying totake Jeremy off the ship again. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's reading normal now. How did you manage that? <eos> <bos> TROI: If there's anything else I need, I know where to find you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I started to hear from him less and less. I knew his career wastaking him away from me but I didn't want to believe it was over. Ispent a lot of time thinking about him. Wondering where he was, what hewas doing. Sometimes I'd look into the sky and imagine that he knew,and that somehow he could sense me thinking about him. So, who knows? Maybe one night we were looking up at the same star, and you werethinking about me, and in a way, I was thinking about you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Min was beautiful, of course, strong, intelligent, patient. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's beautiful. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. I'm not sure what happened. <eos> <bos> TROI: It would destroy them. <eos> <bos> TROI: He also mentioned that you said you saw something in thetransporter beam. <eos> <bos> TROI: Most children do. <eos> <bos> TROI: To watch him moving away from being like you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, what did you want? <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, lights. Computer, turn on the lights. <eos> <bos> TROI: Who's going to come and kill everyone? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, yes, of course, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Right now, there isn't much he can understand. He's holding allhis feelings inside. Children often feel they must be true to thememory of a lost parent. If you offer affection to them too soon theycan feel guilty returning that affection. As if they're betraying thelove of the parent. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why did you do that, Mother? You embarrassed both of us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Vulcans possess telepathic ability. Sarek may unintentionally beprojecting intense emotions onto other people, at random. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's right. <eos> <bos> TROI: I have no idea. I've never seen it before. <eos> <bos> TROI: The program's installed and waiting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, let me help you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was born on Betazed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Am I too late? <eos> <bos> TROI: They seem to be creatures of extremes. One moment violent beyonddescription, the next tender. They are related to the Vulcans, but aseach race developed, their differences grew wider. They are intenselycurious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. Forsome reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it isthat fascination, more than anything else, that has kept the peace. Oneother thing. They will not initiate anything. They will wait for you tocommit yourself. <eos> <bos> TROI: So am I. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's enough! <eos> <bos> TROI: There must be some way we can track it. <eos> <bos> TROI: How long will the fields last? <eos> <bos> TROI: That was meant as a joke, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well I suggest we beam them both back onto the ship. CommanderData is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm able to feel much more from him now, Captain. His emotionsare still a jumble, but <eos> <bos> TROI: No, a Counsellor has to maintain a discreet distance. I'd ratherthink of us as friends. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure, but they were calling me to the southern polarregion. I believe that's where we should look for the Essex. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: I felt her die. <eos> <bos> TROI: We'll make sure Isabella isn't anywhere around, okay? Come on. <eos> <bos> TROI: This deck is devoted mainly to stellarcartography, biological research, and astrophysics. We have over athousand people on board <eos> <bos> TROI: How long did you spend in each time period? Did it seem likeminutes, hours? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why have you removed our clothing? <eos> <bos> TROI: She's returning home from a conference on Achrady Seven, andshe's going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some timevisiting with us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, what's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sometimes. This must be what Mother felt about you. I believe wecould read each other eventually. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very close together. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's very enthusiastic. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've never been a parent. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's the puzzle. With most life forms I can usually feelsomething. I may not be able to understand or interpret it, but I feelsomething, if only a presence. With him, nothing. Empty space. It's asthough he isn't even here. Something about this concerns me. I don'tknow what, I can't point out a reason yet. <eos> <bos> TROI: How are we going to know whether the pulse reboots Data's ethicalprogramme? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Just for a moment, you seemed familiar. <eos> <bos> TROI: You almost always feel a sense of loss, but it is possible tocarry something of that experience through the rest of your life inways that you aren't even aware of now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you really think this has a chance of succeeding? <eos> <bos> TROI: Muzzle it. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's very good. Well, that's very nice. <eos> <bos> TROI: Someone touching my hair. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it was fairly clear during your last appointment. It wasobviously non productive. I couldn't sense what you were feeling. <eos> <bos> TROI: How come we're talking about me instead of you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Would you care to join us, Captain? We have an opening. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: He's telling the truth. Acting Captain's log, stardate 47135.2. DoctorCrusher has positively identified Captain Picard's DNA. There's nodoubt now that he's dead. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did Data say why he wants to see us? <eos> <bos> TROI: There aren't any others. Currently. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you'd liketo admit. Maybe you should get some rest. <eos> <bos> TROI: This man was complaining about a strange doctor and nurse whovisited that patient. Perhaps they're still in the hospital. <eos> <bos> TROI: I won't be joining you. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, if you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I only asked whohe is, and where you met him. Those are not unusual questions. <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe your impression of Data is probably unique. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, that's only natural. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's something we eat after the main course. It's usually verysweet, it's usually very bad for you. We eat it purely for pleasure. Ifyou ask me, it's the best part of any meal. <eos> <bos> TROI: With the vaccine? None. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's your mother like, Geordi? <eos> <bos> TROI: Not really, but <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it's time you told me what this is all about. <eos> <bos> TROI: The secondary plasma vent has a tripleredundant bypass. Which means that the primary access junction isrouted through <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, no! <eos> <bos> TROI: He said, thank you. I told him we will miss him. And I will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Liko, you don't want to kill me. <eos> <bos> TROI: It must be. The dominant personality is unstable. Brilliant butvain, sensitive yet paranoid. And I believe it is prone toirrationality. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand. Bright what? Tell me more. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wounded? Isolated? <eos> <bos> TROI: It was once a little more than that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, when I was a young girl, my grandfather used to tell mestories by the fire. I would close my eyes and listen to his mind forhours on end. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are we at war with the Ferengi yet? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I have his address. When you get back to Earth, you can goand see him. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're concerned. We're afraid whatever happened on the Brittainmay be starting here. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honour to meet you, Doctor Graves. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, it's quite inappropriate to ask thecaptain to <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but that doesn't meanyou can't make a future for yourself. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you don't tell them so you can gain an advantage. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: How can you be so sure? <eos> <bos> TROI: How long have I been here? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but I can't read youright now. <eos> <bos> TROI: I read your report. <eos> <bos> TROI: It is our way. <eos> <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Commander, but I believe Mister Barclay and I had adate scheduled, for a walk in the Arboretum? <eos> <bos> TROI: The other two are secretive, but she is as open as she appears. <eos> <bos> TROI: We set him free. Riker and I do notbelieve in these fables about an Overseer. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become aCommander? I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be ChiefMedical Officer, so why put yourself through all the extra work? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've asked myself that question a lot during the past few days. Idon't know. I doubt it. Nevertheless, it's what they believe in, and itwon't be an easy matter to talk them into leaving. <eos> <bos> TROI: You could be over-preparing. You've been looking forward to theupgrade of the holodeck. You have the time. Captain, you need thediversion. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't even think about it. <eos> <bos> TROI: The plan has failed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Klingon culture is not in your taste? <eos> <bos> TROI: Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! <eos> <bos> TROI: I hope I'm not interrupting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maques believes my mother's psyche has collapsed in on itself. That for some reason, she has retreated into her metaconscious mind. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, er, your performance records have always been good. You'rethorough, dedicated. <eos> <bos> TROI: Kestra? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's a lot to review. My mother's kept a journal since beforeshe was married. <eos> <bos> TROI: One seven three. Daedalus-class starship. Crew, two hundredand twenty nine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you still angry with her? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but you're not convinced. <eos> <bos> TROI: I need a bath. You have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: The way other people change. How they start to treat youdifferently. They walk on eggshells around you. Sometimes they avoidyou altogether. Sometimes they become overbearing, reach out a helpinghand to the blind woman. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've learned a great deal in a very short time. I'm sure itwon't be long before your words do justice to your thoughts. <eos> <bos> TROI: In what way? <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Let's do something with Isabella another day. <eos> <bos> TROI: I do remember. I always felt safe when you sang to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: And that you were causing it now? <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to get a message to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: What you're doing here is miraculous. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. Shefrightens me, Will. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent. They're out of proportion. They're evil. <eos> <bos> TROI: Animals are worshipped in many cultures. <eos> <bos> TROI: But we have asked the mining settlement to send any vessels theymight have. You know, there are many reasons why the shuttlecraft mayhave been delayed. <eos> <bos> TROI: I began to panic. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hard to say. Someone is hiding something, but I can't tell who orwhat. <eos> <bos> TROI: I am happy. Why can't you believe that? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? Thefact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least sometelepathic ability. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. No life form anything like us. <eos> <bos> TROI: As Ship's Counsellor, I offer my assistance. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our plan? What about the people on that freighter? Why did youfire? <eos> <bos> TROI: Like a message in a bottle. <eos> <bos> TROI: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sorefor a week. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because it's the right thing to do. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, they may know as little about us as we do about them. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wouldn't know. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you feel different now? <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, some of our greatest advances have come from analysingfailure. While it can be ego-bruising <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know what we can do to help him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I don't <eos> <bos> TROI: After the past few days, I could use something a little bland. Goodbye, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think Jeremy's ready to accept Worf right now. Perhapslater, but it will have to be handled most delicately. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was certain it would never happen, Captain. The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me awayfrom home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoidtradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. <eos> <bos> TROI: Except me. And all I have is nightmares. I can hardly sleep atall anymore. In the end, I'll be like him. Just like him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand this. The story should be over. What's left? <eos> <bos> TROI: Frankly, I'm envious. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my motheris a Betazoid. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a start. <eos> <bos> TROI: My grandfather rarely spoke. He said that was for off-worldersand people who didn't know any better. Now the only time I can rememberhis stories is when I go home and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes whenI'm alone there, it's almost as if I can hear his voice inside my head. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's Ian. Hurry. <eos> <bos> TROI: How so? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? <eos> <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop search. Computer, how many entries are there for Darmok? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's not what I meant. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Have you made preparations to separate the Saucer section? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Where was Lieutenant Kwan's station? <eos> <bos> TROI: But you're reading their emotional states, their inner selves,and then using that to manipulate them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ship's Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's the woman in Wyatt's drawings. Captain's log, stardate 41294.6. Orbiting Havenwith the Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question. Whatstrange of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone'simagination to appear on the plague ship? <eos> <bos> TROI: Did he get along with his coworkers? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: You're quite right, Picard, it's not rest we seek. Only escape. <eos> <bos> TROI: Even for your wife? <eos> <bos> TROI: Has the alien communicated? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: He has other obligations, Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's an interesting thought <eos> <bos> TROI: As I told you, Captain, the ship broke up in the atmosphere, andthe bridge went down here. When we reach it, you will beam what's leftof our skeletal remains on board this ship and then take them back toEarth for a proper burial. You see how simple a request this is? <eos> <bos> TROI: You had a good time. <eos> <bos> TROI: With your permission, Captain, there is one way to find out. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't you think you should tell the rest of the crew? <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you coming? <eos> <bos> TROI: Now something has changed that. <eos> <bos> TROI: You want him. I can tell. But you have nothing to give him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, there must be a record somewhere. There is a good chance wecan find it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your father? <eos> <bos> TROI: Dark? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well how do I know what to study if you won't tell me what I didwrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thanks for your help. Come in for a minute? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is the truth as each of you remembers it. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened there? <eos> <bos> TROI: Respect is earned, not bestowed. <eos> <bos> TROI: It lasted barely a moment. She experiencedfear and confusion. And then for no apparent reason she walked out ofmy quarters. She didn't say another word, she just started walking hereand each step became more and more difficult. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wanted so much to help him, to be there for him, but the more Iwas. <eos> <bos> TROI: I just thought you'd like some time alone. I'll see you later. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then ask me one I can answer. <eos> <bos> TROI: What will you do now? <eos> <bos> TROI: Leave her alone. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all right, no one's going to hurt you. <eos> <bos> TROI: He was. I don't know how he managed it. The Gemarians and theDachlyds are both incredibly stubborn people. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm just not ready to give up my life here. Not yet. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that how you felt when he left to live with your parents? <eos> <bos> TROI: So you're trying to establish a dominant position by making himwait for you. The trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight fordominance, one of them ends up dead. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, what's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Your self portrait is so practiced, so polished. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well then, maybe I should slow down. Catch my breath. Not letthis get out of control. + <eos> <bos> TROI: Very, very advanced, sir, or certainly very, very different. <eos> <bos> TROI: So first thing tomorrow, I thought I'd take you on a tour of theoperational centres and the residential decks of the ship. Then wecould spend some time discussing the cultural underpinnings of yoursociety. <eos> <bos> TROI: Could you open this door for me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Wait, wait. You're over-analysing, Data. One cannot deny humannature. What kind of a man is Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. I believe something invaded them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Timothy, would you like Data to stay with you a little bitlonger? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mmm hmm. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's an understatement. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly? <eos> <bos> TROI: I panicked. <eos> <bos> TROI: How long will the field last? <eos> <bos> TROI: Your saddle? <eos> <bos> TROI: They're still here! <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, A single leader can make mistakes. It's far less likely inthe combined whole. Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, it was my pleasure. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor, I think Commander Data will do very nicely. <eos> <bos> TROI: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but in a nightmare of disjointed images and half-heardvoices. He's in another dimension, looking at us across a great chasm. And he's feeling remorse at what he has witnessed. He's afraid. <eos> <bos> TROI: I am not a mind control expert. I came here because I sensed youwere in pain. <eos> <bos> TROI: And now they have become militant. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm feeling very dizzy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, the issue isn't one of trust in Tam's intentions, but inhis judgment. I would trust him to do what he believes is right <eos> <bos> TROI: The Romulans could've decloaked before the Enterprise had achance to respond. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: If I may suggest <eos> <bos> TROI: There's a duality in the man. It's hard todescribe. He's aware of his crimes. In fact, they trouble him deeply. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ambassador Loquel's quite pleasant. I will admit though, he's alittle unusual. <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't look well. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, remember what we talked about? Your father wants to do this by himself. <eos> <bos> TROI: They will now attempt to negotiate for the safety and release oftheir people. Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I would becounselling the Captain at a time like this. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd like to try that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Who's this? <eos> <bos> TROI: It was as though you were performing a scene for all of us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Some sexual attraction from all the males. Lieutenant Yar isphysically very attractive. But with Lutan I felt something else. Something more like avarice or ambition. <eos> <bos> TROI: Much the same has happened in human history too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos> <bos> TROI: From now on I want you to ask a grown-up before you go to anyplace that is off-limits. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, how did you feel about the Captain, about your father? <eos> <bos> TROI: Who have you been talking to? <eos> <bos> TROI: If it's the best we can do, we have to try it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, you can't start thinking like that. You didn't abandonhim. You chose not to abandon a life-long career. It was the rightdecision, and in no way responsible for his death. <eos> <bos> TROI: And his father. <eos> <bos> TROI: I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you toconsider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss. Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion ofcloseness and romance. <eos> <bos> TROI: You think we sent ourselves a message? <eos> <bos> TROI: Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's lying. They have no intention of keeping theirword. <eos> <bos> TROI: God forbid I should miss my first look at thewormhole. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why would someone do that? <eos> <bos> TROI: It could provide us with valuable information about what'stroubling him. You know, there's nothing wrong with a healthy fantasylife, as long as you don't let it take over. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's right. You're no match for theHollanders. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Could the colonists have escaped? <eos> <bos> TROI: He may have been curt, but he was also very worried and even alittle scared. <eos> <bos> TROI: And the emptiness remains. You sound so alone. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, how does it feel being with people again? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Abandoned. Who deserted you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will Riker and I are good friends. <eos> <bos> TROI: Isabella, it's not very nice to get Clara to do things that sheisn't supposed to. <eos> <bos> TROI: I had a very strange visit from one of yourofficers today. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're coming. They're coming with the storm. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh? Why is that? <eos> <bos> TROI: On the holodeck we've made that legend come true. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, may I have a word with you in private? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality. Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is unquestionablytelepathic. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why would you create this fantasy? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard is familiar with that, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: Exactly what are you feeling? <eos> <bos> TROI: It will just gauge your psychological reactions to the images itprojects. Watch the screen and let your mind go blank. The device willdo the rest. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you were just going to talk to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will's been trying to get this piece right for ten years now. He's never made it through the solo. <eos> <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hold position and wait. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm investigating Lieutenant Kwan's death, and I just wanted tolook around. <eos> <bos> TROI: You look very handsome, if I might saying so Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you. You're envious of him. You pretend to support him, butsecretly you want him to fail. <eos> <bos> TROI: A restraint of some kind? <eos> <bos> TROI: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander is scared, confused, hurt, all because his father is refusing to see him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Anticipation is fun. We'll be late for dinner. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ambassador, I think we're going to get along very well. Shall we? <eos> <bos> TROI: And you think that your feelings toward Nella could change theway you function as Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, you're supposed to be avoiding telepathy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you feeling sad? <eos> <bos> TROI: We can't do that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. I thought you were brilliant. You've changed. <eos> <bos> TROI: It must be somewhat overwhelming. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories? <eos> <bos> TROI: How can we be of help? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've never tried it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait. I'll try to be only half as annoying. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to tell her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm concerned our new passengers. Their emotions do notfit who they are and what they're doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: I need to talk to your father, Jean-Luc. Would you mind leavingus alone for a moment? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, where did you, when did you meet this man? Who is he? Imean, marriage? When did all this happen? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think he's handling it very well. <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense no unusual reaction, Captain. After all, such a change ishardly out of the ordinary. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you have another dream last night? <eos> <bos> TROI: I want to suggest something. Call it a theory, all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. It's just that thechoice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, you're just trying to keep me here. Keep me from findingsomething. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, you're undermining every effort we're trying to makehere. <eos> <bos> TROI: Agreed. Also, he's arrogant, overbearing, self-important, andvery sure of himself and his ability. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm curious. Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've alreadyexperienced? Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again? <eos> <bos> TROI: Bill. <eos> <bos> TROI: Have you ever been with a counsellor before? <eos> <bos> TROI: Imzadi, do you still care about me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you talking to me from Sickbay? <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop. Go back. Further back. There. Stop. One moon circles. <eos> <bos> TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handlingcommand. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some verydifficult decisions. <eos> <bos> TROI: About Worf or Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> TROI: Who was responsible? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takesan enormous commitment. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can I have an order of Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order. <eos> <bos> TROI: Most Betazoids born like that never lead a normal life. <eos> <bos> TROI: But it was a thrill. Lutan is such, such a basic male image andhaving him say he wants you <eos> <bos> TROI: So, what did you wish for, Will? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Doctor. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir somefeelings. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't like goodbyes. How about, until next time. <eos> <bos> TROI: It may be that when Lieutenant Pierce was struck by the plasmastream, the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathicpattern into the residue. <eos> <bos> TROI: He may be injured. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, this is not an isolated incident. There have beenreports of random violence all over the ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? Troi to Sickbay. Medical emergency in the arboretum. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, let us see Thomas Raymond. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf we were supposed to have lunch together, remember? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where am I? <eos> <bos> TROI: Your discovery has produced a great deal of excitement, Premier. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both heand Ensign T'Su are very young. <eos> <bos> TROI: That we get confirmation of this mission from our headquarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good luck. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: From his body language as well as his words and tone, I'd judgethat what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back. <eos> <bos> TROI: He can never come back, Mrs. Miller. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander, wait! It's the Captain. But only the Captain. He's outthere alone! <eos> <bos> TROI: Why'd you lock the door? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know what to say. It's a great honour. So, that wouldmake me your? <eos> <bos> TROI: Tasha. <eos> <bos> TROI: Okay, fine, if I need to. Right now, I just want to go back towork. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And youshouldn't worry about making it look perfect. <eos> <bos> TROI: All I did was lose my temper. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come on, it'll be all right. <eos> <bos> TROI: What is going on here? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hard at work? <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His facelooked like that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because hership is as crippled as the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: All right, I admit it was a catalyst. But I can honestly say thatI've been thinking about this off and on over the past two years. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: What does she say? <eos> <bos> TROI: You've come a long way, Reg. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. I've never known you to have such strong emotions, exceptwhen you're expecting to do battle. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's psychologically valid. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you wish you had said? <eos> <bos> TROI: And it frightens you. <eos> <bos> TROI: In every Western I've ever read, the villains always break theirword. he can't be trusted. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, you do have a lot to offer. <eos> <bos> TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. And we gave it to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that better, sweetheart? Everything's going to be fine. <eos> <bos> TROI: In a way that pleases people who care about your happiness, yes,it is. <eos> <bos> TROI: They haven't tried to communicate with the outside. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Surely you must have some means of communication in case of aplanetary emergency. <eos> <bos> TROI: You are very tall. It might be threatening to some people. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really don't think this is the place to be discussing this. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said you woke up a new woman thismorning. <eos> <bos> TROI: What the future holds no one canknow, But forward we look and forward we go. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: The double bars indicate an elongated S sound. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was it something about the console itself? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've learned to remind myself that my mother and I are twoseparate individuals. <eos> <bos> TROI: Talking about it would help you understand your response. I'mgoing to find out if anyone else on the ship has had these kind ofexperiences. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was as though my own consciousness were pushed to the side. Iwas watchingeverything happen, hearing my own voice, but not being able to controlany of it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I have never attempted anything like this before. When dealingwith two factions so diametrically opposed, so entrenched in theirpositions, where do you start? <eos> <bos> TROI: Have you discussed this with Alexander? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you should know he and I have had a prior relationship. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's just, how well do you really know him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Human males are unique. Fathers continue to regard their sons aschildren, even into adulthood. And sons continue to chafe against whatthey perceive as their fathers' expectations of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're running out of time. Farek's about to begin the neural scanon Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Several times with Captain Picard. There have been instances whenhaving an empath along has been helpful. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want to know anything you can tell me that could help. <eos> <bos> TROI: We mustn't do this. Will, don't. Will, no! <eos> <bos> TROI: But I'll honour them, of course. I'm a Betazoid. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now, Data, you remember the psychotronicstability examination. We all had to take it before graduating from theAcademy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Who is he? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ultimately, Jenna will care for you for what you are, not whatyou imitate out of a book. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why would we be sending them power? <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought I heard one of the Engineers say something about apower transfer. Something about an energy feedback. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where they belong, Mother, Right under you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because I want to help, if I can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: Just a moment. Yes. Yes, I'm fine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you think he felt abandoned? After all, he left very soonafter K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother, he losthis father as well. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I come in? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm trying to help the boy learn thevalue of responsibility. You're not helping by giving him a lot ofmixed messages. <eos> <bos> TROI: And we still can't even say hello to these people. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: J'Dan, we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of ourdilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands one week later. <eos> <bos> TROI: To break their spirit. <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't have a plan anymore. <eos> <bos> TROI: It never happened to me before. <eos> <bos> TROI: When was the last attempt made? <eos> <bos> TROI: I won't trick you or lie to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I don't think so. No. There's nothing. Nothing. I sensenothing. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: Terraformers are often obsessive. It frequently goes with thecareer profile. <eos> <bos> TROI: I felt something during the concert. Vague and undefined, butvery disturbing <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. His desire for peace issincere. He wants this alliance. There is no cause for concern. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Whatever you choose will be yours for your lifetime. It's adecision that will affect how people interrelate with you. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I want to stay in my quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not really familiar with that protocol. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've been fine, but I thought + <eos> <bos> TROI: Our consciousness has been trapped on this moon for twocenturies. We must escape this torture. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander, I need to come too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien racecommunicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on aplanet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine. S'smarith. What did I just say? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all deception. Nothing the Pakleds havesaid or done has been sincere. <eos> <bos> TROI: I meant, how's it going with you? <eos> <bos> TROI: You didn't know? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I means you both agree to your responsibilities. And whenyou've done the things that you've agreed to do, then you've earned theprivilege to doing the things that you want to do. When he's cleanedhis room, for instance, then perhaps he's earned a visit to theholodeck to fight his alien monsters. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're doing fine. I was just about to get him his supper. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure they are. Data, you obviously don't have a trouble withrealism, but you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you shouldtry something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a newpiece. I'd like you to sculpt music. <eos> <bos> TROI: I suggest you find a new line of work. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you're still looking. <eos> <bos> TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get awayfrom him. She was afraid of him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm not really dressed for areception. <eos> <bos> TROI: Go on. You've wanted to tell him for a long time. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't believe it was an accident. I think Lieutenant Piercefound out the other two were having an affair. He lost control and hekilled them both. Afterwards, he probably activated the plasma streamand then threw himself into it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why won't they stabilise? <eos> <bos> TROI: Geordi, are you in pain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, you've been very patient with Ambassador Byleth, and that'sgood. But maybe it's time to let him know that some behaviour isunacceptable to us. I think it's all right to suggest limits for theAmbassador. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why don't you try, Jake? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, you might first try a relaxation technique, like plexing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not now. But soon. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened, Mother. What happened next? <eos> <bos> TROI: I can no longer fulfill my obligations. What other option isthere? <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps we're looking in the wrong place. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wish I could say. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nevertheless, you are here. <eos> <bos> TROI: What were the voices saying? <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe there are still people alive down there and I'm goingto give them every chance. Assuming they're alive, they'll be hopingthere's someone up here who can help them. So we'll help them. Chief,divert the necessary power to Engineering. <eos> <bos> TROI: We cannot risk an engagement here. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think so. I'm feeling a bit unfocused. It'll pass. <eos> <bos> TROI: So you like horses for the romance? <eos> <bos> TROI: Difficult under the circumstances. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. It's directed down toward the old Bandi city. <eos> <bos> TROI: What is that? <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, dispatches. <eos> <bos> TROI: To Will, all my love, Deanna. <eos> <bos> TROI: Roga, don't! You'll be killed! <eos> <bos> TROI: Pull up a chair. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you suggest? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not quite his style. <eos> <bos> TROI: Careful, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violatethat. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can feel them all. What they want, what they feel. It's a sideof humans I've never felt before. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really would rather be alone right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: What thoughts? Take your time. <eos> <bos> TROI: It might be the message we've been looking for. <eos> <bos> TROI: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Come on, Eric. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want him to stop. It's not Will. Somebody's taken his place. <eos> <bos> TROI: How would he react under stress? <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe you could draw me a picture. I'd love to see what she lookslike. <eos> <bos> TROI: I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted badlyto one another. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, he's not. <eos> <bos> TROI: Whatever happened, this is beginning to look less and less like aRomulan attack. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you bothered by his being here? <eos> <bos> TROI: You, sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: There's more here than you're telling us. You're forcing yourselfto hold back. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's right, Lal. Just like me. <eos> <bos> TROI: This isn't going to be easy for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: If there is a cosmic plan, are we not a part of it? Our presenceat this place at this moment in time could be a part of that fate. <eos> <bos> TROI: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Sorry I'm late. I lost track of the time. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't really think it's really a secret. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was the day before you started your tour on the Potemkin. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was I? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf. From what I understand, there's a good chance my Worf won'treturn. I guess it's just hard for me to accept that there's a realityout there where you never loved me. <eos> <bos> TROI: The mirror. I came in here. I looked into the mirror. It wasn'tme, Worf! It wasn't me! It was my face, but it wasn't me inside. <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodnight, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know, but this isn't a Klingon ship and Data was your friend. And it's the second time you've replaced a crewmate who's died. <eos> <bos> TROI: I could fall in love with you so easily, but we both know the endof that story, don't we? How would Martin feel about introducinghalf-Betazoid into the genetic balance? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're right. I don't trust you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because if you're asking me if I liked what you were playing,then the answer is yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Three dead, four wounded. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think I have. The man who looked familiar to me may have servedon board the Enterprise in the last seven years, so I've asked thecomputer to limit its search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitiaand on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think Orton's in a talking mood, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? <eos> <bos> TROI: The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but I don'tunderstand Starfleet's urgency. <eos> <bos> TROI: Something's wrong. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're also very anxious about something. It's Will, isn't it? You're not as close to him as you'd like to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: If he made any personal logs, it might be helpful to look throughthem. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, where have you decided to go? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ode to Psyche. John Keats. <eos> <bos> TROI: Just bear with me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. Four, maybe five seconds. You just stopped and thenstarted again. I can't explain it. <eos> <bos> TROI: It would also help if they knew what was going on. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! Captain's log, stardate 45430.9. Counsellor Troihas fallen into a deep coma. After a thorough examination, DoctorCrusher has been unable to find signs of illness or infection. <eos> <bos> TROI: We were brought to this moon over five centuries ago from a starsystem called Ux-Mal. We were separated from our bodies and left todrift in the storms. Once we almost escaped, on board the Essex, butthat ship was incapable of eluding this moon's electromagnetic storms. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd like that. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. You thought it would amuse you, but it didn't. You felt nosatisfaction. <eos> <bos> TROI: His nonchalance is studied and practised. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Federation has neglected to visit to your planet for far toolong. With your permission, we would like to correct that oversight. <eos> <bos> TROI: On that subject Mother, there is such a thing as too much honestywith humans. <eos> <bos> TROI: I doubt that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened lastnight? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, this isn't right. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, I hung that painting there. At your birthday party,remember? <eos> <bos> TROI: It was useful. I felt two levels. He did know about the lifeform, but the idea of murder seemed to shock him. Whether it was thewhole idea, or just being accused of it, I can't tell. <eos> <bos> TROI: Seldom have I heard an explanation so well-rehearsed. <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't sound very convinced of that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Jev. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a gameof intuition. <eos> <bos> TROI: If they send him back. Ensign Rager still hasn't been returned. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wyatt, I'm happy for you, and for Ariana too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lower the forcefield. <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense awakening memories in the boy. This is a very fragiletime for Jono. If we send away the man he calls father without evenletting them see each other, how will we ever gain his trust? <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, that Klingon stuff is very important to your father. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm in for twenty. <eos> <bos> TROI: He is concealing something. It's more than just being too busy. Your announcement about coming down has sent him almost to a point ofpanic. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure he'll do very well. She's a wonderful teacher. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know what an important day this is for you, the anniversary ofyour Rite of Ascension. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm fine. There's nothing wrong. I'm just tired, that's all. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet, you want acompanion. <eos> <bos> TROI: Today would have been your husband's thirty eighth birthday. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's that supposed to mean? <eos> <bos> TROI: You have pointed out yourself we are all at risk every day ofevery mission. <eos> <bos> TROI: Interesting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then all we've done is made things worse. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. Janet. Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to cancel your appointmenttoday. Actually, I'm resigning as Ship's Counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't you think so? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not just that. I've worked hard to make a life for myself onthe Enterprise. I'm happy here. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: What are these dark spots? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: What did happen? <eos> <bos> TROI: I was just visiting. We'll talk again soon, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense a touch of hostility here, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? What's at Keystone City? <eos> <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I'm moving too fast for me. <eos> <bos> DATA: The problem, sir, is there. Although they'velearned of the Prime Directive from my mind, how will they evaluate it? How do they reason? What are their values? Remember their warning tous, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, are you all right? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will begin immediately, sir. Is that all? <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. The rear wall. <eos> <bos> DATA: I simply altered my premise for playing the game. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry I could not be more helpful, Doctor Pulaski. <eos> <bos> DATA: SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message. <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. We are not where we are supposed to be. <eos> <bos> DATA: The emission is emanating from this direction. Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I can find no other exits. I believe we are trapped here. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbitaround Theta Eight, still out of contact with the away team. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Holmes collected nothing, neither trinkets nor thoughts, whichwere not specifically significant to him. <eos> <bos> DATA: All information is time-coded by entry, and the bits when totaledproduce an aggregate amount which <eos> <bos> DATA: All the Borg you have experimented on so far have sufferedextensive brain damage. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of theNel system. Perhaps they will show different results. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. It is a stalemate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, where are you going? Geordi? <eos> <bos> DATA: Bingo? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. Is that not areference to an ancient Earth game? <eos> <bos> DATA: She also expressed a desire to leave the colony. She hopes toapply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet. <eos> <bos> DATA: A wide variety of items. The replicator can make anything youdesire. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. I am not entirely certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again? <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, sensors indicate fiveMintakans in your immediate vicinity. Four are motionless. The fifth iseight meters away, proceeding south. Is Nuria one of these five? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show Captain Picard and the Tamarianin apparent good health, approximately twenty metres from each other. <eos> <bos> DATA: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> DATA: With their orbital control station, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have given you an erroneous impression. <eos> <bos> DATA: This will take some time, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I realise that, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far the material seemsrather very ordinary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, we have reached the designated coordinates. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why have you suspended the game? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet the Sheliak andthe Federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet Sheliakdomain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Wes! The transporter. <eos> <bos> DATA: But what if it does, Counsellor? What if it turns out that thoseare the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not makeme a bad person? <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot see what effect my being here would have had <eos> <bos> DATA: Forward thrusters have failed, sir. We are losing power. <eos> <bos> DATA: Project emitter beam, heading zero two four mark zero four one. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without the protection of the forcefields, we are completelyvulnerable. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is unfortunate it cannot be studied. The resonator is a keyartefact from a remarkable period of history. <eos> <bos> DATA: Meaning the microbrains might be photoelectric. <eos> <bos> DATA: My hair does not require trimming, you lunkhead. <eos> <bos> DATA: The wave has been growing in size as well as power. There isinsufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reachesLemma Two. <eos> <bos> DATA: Q, I strongly suggest that you cooperate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: It seemed appropriate. Captain, you took a substantial risk inallowing the Enterprise to complete its task. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There is nothing wrong with the ship's sensors. Thereason we did not sense life signs aboard the escape vessel is becausethe prisoner has no life signs. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why should I? This concerns me more than it does any of you. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not to my knowledge, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, is this poker? <eos> <bos> DATA: As opposed to what? <eos> <bos> DATA: Human language gives me difficulty too, sir. Imperfect could meanI lack certain abilities he possesses. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us? <eos> <bos> DATA: So he said. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators. <eos> <bos> DATA: Here is the visor. May I ask why you wanted it? <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we examine the memory subsystem next. <eos> <bos> DATA: An accurate analogy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Irrelevant, sir. Even if he restarts his engine now, he will nothave enough thrust to escape impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate the field generators on the planet surface arecharging, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Marr, do you wish to change the frequency? Doctor Marr? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I do have a functional respiration system. However, itspurpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems. I am, infact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, it would appear that the Romulan's intent is to contactTin Man first, at any cost. According to my sensor readings, thewarbird has exceeded maximum engine output by thirty percent. They seemto have irreparable damage to their warp coils. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am glad that you understand, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. It might be due to problems currently being experiencedby the Yamato. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data is dead. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: The motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostaticenergy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we couldcreate a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise theparticles. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot permit this to continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: By comparing the Stargazer's main computerlog with Captain Picard's personal log, I have found checksumdiscrepancies, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is releasing what appear to be energyfragments, which are then ingested by the entities through the orifice. Perhaps some sort of nourishment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the vessel being piloted by LieutenantRo is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is the point? <eos> <bos> DATA: Then it is better not to trust. <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you provide more information, sir? Seeking an instance ofsomeone showering in his or her clothing is <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> DATA: All I have found sir, is what you already know. Manheim wasconcentrating on time gravity experiments when he left. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot, sir. The transporter cycle has already begun. Captain's log, stardate 44668.1. Doctor Crusher'sresearch indicates that we have less than an hour before Commander LaForge's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts tolocate him on the surface have failed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perform a level 5 diagnostic on the shuttle's power andnavigational systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: At the moment, I am looking for a common event or experience thatGia, Garvin and Skoran might have shared that could have a causalrelationship to their illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Begin docking procedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: We need only to programme the computer with details of thespecific ceremony. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. It would appear that the nodes are in theprocess of creating a rudimentary neural net. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know for certain, but I believe it is during my creativeendeavours that I come closest to experiencing what it must be like tobe human. <eos> <bos> DATA: When the interface malfunction occurred, subroutine C forty sevenwas replaced by elements from my personal programming. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision. <eos> <bos> DATA: I've found them, sir. The door to theircompartment is jammed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Daily? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have noticed, however, that you appear a bit uncomfortableyourself. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you so desire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded, sir. Without breaking the code, we will be unable to identify any specificFerengi vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have studied much human literature on the subject of love andromantic liaisons. There are many role models for me to emulate. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are numerous animal remains in the area, leading me tohypothesize that the vines could be predatory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Jessel. She can be frightfully trying at times, but she does makeme laugh. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting no signs of <eos> <bos> DATA: As well as the crew records, and the personal logs. <eos> <bos> DATA: Minimal oxygen atmosphere. An ancient solargenerator, still operating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek ofRomulus. This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in whichPardek participated four years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is built into my positronic decompiler. Itwill be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was my fault. I am responsible for their deaths. In myarrogance I thought no one could possibly harm the great Riva. I amsuch a fool. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to locate them anywherewithin transporter range. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been formulating nutritional supplements for Spot. <eos> <bos> DATA: and intense energy fields which appear to bestabil <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, a game! <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up something mostunusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be humanDNA. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would either of you mind if I made a personalinquiry? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However,your methods leave much to be desired. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. It is a most unusual phenomenon. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have an engine failure warning in the <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interferewith our sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: How does it feel? <eos> <bos> DATA: Baby needs a new pair of shoes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so. What has happened? <eos> <bos> DATA: There's limited information available onPakled culture, but the eclectic range of their equipment suggeststheir technology was borrowed from others. <eos> <bos> DATA: Coordinates received, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have read them all. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are slowing to impulse, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My initial assumption was correct. You do wish to speak of yourmother. <eos> <bos> DATA: When he was attempting to contact the real Bridge, he was in factspeaking to a simulation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Right, That's enough. Sit down, both of you. You over there, youthere. Down. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they areall too young to be Miranda Vigo. <eos> <bos> DATA: Power connections are complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus shouldwork on non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are eachde-evolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds. I feel I mustinform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus. <eos> <bos> DATA: We should try to find the commonalties in these events. Wherewere the people you were with? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I am attempting to master all known styles of painting. Thisone is in the style of the early French impressionists. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. Nothing in our survey suggests the source ofa parasitic infection. <eos> <bos> DATA: My programming may be inadequate to the task. <eos> <bos> DATA: To some degree. Doctor Soong hoped to provide me with an amalgamof the colonists' memories. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our readings show no evidence of any, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your parents will be safe now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I am reading a minor power drainin the starboard conduit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are being pulled inside. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you think I am responsible? <eos> <bos> DATA: I beg your pardon, Wesley? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will signal for immediate beam out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two hours nineteen minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, release compound into the airflow system, fiveparts per million. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is at your mercy? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have been too literal with respect to my set design. Computer, modify holodeckprogramme Data seven three. Shakespeare'sThe Tempest, Act Five, scene one. Increasetorchlight by twenty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Music, Professor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we're here. Why not avail ourselves of this opportunityfor study? There is a giant protostar here in the process of forming. No other vessel has been out this far. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanatingfrom the same location. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would also explain the failure of their warp drive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did you find our deception pleasing? <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields are down. <eos> <bos> DATA: From alcohol? That is not possible for me, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibility, sir. An unexplained power fluctuation. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. You will just move it again, and I will not help you hurthim. <eos> <bos> DATA: A subspace field coil with an isolated power source. Curious. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not appear to be affected. <eos> <bos> DATA: Everything seems to remind me of the nightmare. Objects, sounds,smells. And now I have seen elements of the dream in a waking state. Icannot explain it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute now being served aboardstarships. It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of alcohol, butthe intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed. <eos> <bos> DATA: The asteroid has shattered. However, the core is still intact andstill on a collision course with Tessen Three. <eos> <bos> DATA: I've lost the signal, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indubitably, my good woman. <eos> <bos> DATA: I take it that is your name? May I inquire as to yourdestination? <eos> <bos> DATA: We believe the parasites came through the ship's hull after wedestroyed the asteroid near Tessen Three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our orders are to proceed to this star, Beta Stromgren. Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of analternating cycle of expansion and collapse, and will soon result in asupernova. However, the unmanned long range space probe sent byStarfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with thesame anaphasic signature as the one we found on Ned Quint's body. <eos> <bos> DATA: But the Doctor <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in thecentre of its body. <eos> <bos> DATA: Working together with the aliens, we must discover a means bywhich we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of uscould achieve alone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently such a dump began, was then halted, and thecontainment seals were dropped. There was still sufficient antimatterpresent to lead to an explosion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Very well. I have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: To whom are you referring? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Children of Tama were called incomprehensible by CaptainSilvestri of the Shiku Maru. Other accounts were comparable. <eos> <bos> DATA: If our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero sixterawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not sense the same feelings of absence that I associate withLieutenant Yar, although I cannot say precisely why. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metrein diameter. There are no identifiable armaments. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here? <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. It is as you see it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. I estimate that this scene consists of portions of sevendistinct holodeck programs. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to the shuttle log, the Enterprise was destroyed threehours nineteen minutes from now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tough room? A colloquialism meaning a severe, rigid,closed-minded audience. I understand. I will attempt to be an easyroom. Show me what is funny. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was that intended to be an affirmative? <eos> <bos> DATA: That offer does present a certain fascination. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, you do not seem to appreciate Ensign Tyler's enthusiasm. <eos> <bos> DATA: Theoretically, yes. In reality I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: What are your intentions, Professor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Inform Starfleet Command that we will hold this position untilfurther notice. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I am not looking for my father. <eos> <bos> DATA: I never found it to be necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Subspace signal coming from Starfleet, Captain. Admiral Kennelly. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is something I thought you should know. My father told methat he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted nevertelling her how much he cared for her. I am certain he was referring toyou. <eos> <bos> DATA: The evidence is fairly conclusive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indications of what humans would call a wild party? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sherlock Holmes programme three A has demonstrated some verycurious anomalies. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. But something similar. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an attempt at pure creativity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ensign Williams' striking style is heavily influenced bygeometric constructivism. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that because you place more value on biological life than onartificial life? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, during our attempt to break away, I recorded a momentaryalteration of the movement pattern within the cluster. <eos> <bos> DATA: A coin. Very good. I will replicate one immediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifty one minutes, fourteen seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why are the backups not functioning? <eos> <bos> DATA: The servo mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate humanmovements. I did not realize the effect was so distracting. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is no longer a question of stopping it, sir. The explosion hasalready occurred. The fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: The pleasure is mine, Hutch. I have been meaning to complimentyou on your choice of colours here. <eos> <bos> DATA: The game is seven card stud. After the queen, one-eyed jacks andlow card in the hole are wild. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beacon is falling astern, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I estimate the core breach will consume the Enterprise inapproximately seven hours, two minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander La Forge and I have come up with apotential solution to our predicament. Perhaps the modifications usedto increase firepower against the Borg could be effective here. <eos> <bos> DATA: We were unable to maintain phase match withthe distortion wave, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where? <eos> <bos> DATA: Injector conduit temperature minus onehundred degrees Celsius. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by for auto-phaser interlock. Activating deflector beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are ventingdrive plasma. <eos> <bos> DATA: Atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed, I. Cannot. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no records of any blame against you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Several possibilities suggest themselves. I may represent anentire race of artificial lifeforms. If so, there may be a home planetfor others of my kind. A shared history and a culture of which I am notpresently aware. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are making an unwarranted extrapolation. I was merelyoffering an aesthetic analysis of this particular model. The baseappears quite sturdy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: The transporter beam is focusing on decknine, section four. <eos> <bos> DATA: However it was well within operational limits. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse ishaving an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, we might be able to <eos> <bos> DATA: I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation? <eos> <bos> DATA: Hyperonic radiation also interferes with ship's transporters. They are now inoperable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Friendly insults and jibes, another form of human speechthat I am attempting to master, in this case with the help of CommanderGeordi La Forge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet has responded to our request, sir. A tug willrendezvous with us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase Nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least another six hours, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that anunlikely possibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: But that would defeat the opportunity for our behaviouralresearch. In all probability, he is simply lonely. We can relieve hisanxiety through socialisation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are functioning normally. They are detecting a subspaceparticle emission originating from within this room. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi thinks he is in command here, and he is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Hood is slowing to impulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in thequadrant. <eos> <bos> DATA: A force field was activated on the station afew moments ago. It is possible that Commander La Forge has establisheda low intensity deflector field. <eos> <bos> DATA: A cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away byvisible distortion effects. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are going to allow her to die, are we not? <eos> <bos> DATA: We have lost one of the emitter circuits. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beamsdesigned to guide ships into the sphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi told me herself that feelings are not negative orpositive. It is how we act on them that makes them good or bad. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, unauthorised access of turbolift five ondeck thirty four. <eos> <bos> DATA: I feel no disorientation. <eos> <bos> DATA: He enjoyed her kindness, her gentleness, her physical attributes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you seen many? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data to Enterprise. I ampreparing to leave Tau Cygna Five and await rendezvous instructions. <eos> <bos> DATA: The life signs are very strong now, sir. They are coming fromover there. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix in Sector twenty onefive oh five. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Their sun went supernova, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex. It is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you certain, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, atmospheric dissipation hasaccelerated over the past several hours. I estimate the planet'satmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unable to identify source. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Silence that child! <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not a threat to you. Give me more time. Ourdestruction would only <eos> <bos> DATA: DiMaggio, sir. Jolting Joe, the Yankee clipper. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And perhaps our library files as well, sir. That level ofinformation would be necessary in order to create a true adversary forme. <eos> <bos> DATA: CounsellorDATA <eos> <bos> DATA: And you must solve it. <eos> <bos> DATA: No one laughed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Also travelling at warp speed, sir. Intriguing. I can find nomatch with anything in our records, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was intrigued. Jenna seemed to be displaying genuine affectionfor me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Temperature in the reaction chamber has increased by forty sevenpercent. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. But I possess much of his knowledge. He wasworking on new detectors at the time of the attack on Omicron Theta. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: And it has nothing to do with CommanderRiker's new assignment? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I request you reject me as arbitrator. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tarella was class M, much like your Earth, with similar humanoidlife forms. Unfortunately they faced the old story of hatred out poweringintelligence. <eos> <bos> DATA: They do correspond to Mogh's personal security code. <eos> <bos> DATA: In the meantime, Governor, you should expect the weather problemsto continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most unusual. <eos> <bos> DATA: One is my name. The other is not. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a disruptor. <eos> <bos> DATA: If that is true, he must be trying to reach her now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Co-ordinates set. Warp six on your mark, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be quite suitable, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Deck fifteen. Lal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fascinating. Your society is dedicated exclusively to theproduction of a single product. <eos> <bos> DATA: Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarmrelays, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have analysed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It has beenunaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as atemplate for a retrovirus. It would neutralise the synthetic T-cell,and re-establish the original genetic patterns of each host. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not entirely understand, sir. As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spockwould simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gammascan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Better in some ways, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We followed procedures precisely, Captain. Scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section. I cannotexplain how he escaped. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is very important. Are there any other sources of freshwater near the village? <eos> <bos> DATA: The next distortion wave will impact infourteen seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have reinstated the same programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: I had no choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: The starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We areventing drive plasma. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I just had a strange conversation with your assistant. Although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship Victory,she <eos> <bos> DATA: That one. RW nine six three two one, twentieth century. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you wish to leave orbit, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will stay with you, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: And you, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sakkath has been able, until recently, to usehis telepathic skills to reinforce Sarek's emotional control, thusprotecting others from the effects of his deterioration. <eos> <bos> DATA: He seemed certain that if she knew, it would preclude thepossibility of her being happy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energising, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The planet is Vagra Two, sir, in the Zed Lapis sector. Uninhabited. <eos> <bos> DATA: The condition is identical, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will take time, sir. Downloading this into our system willrequire fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate the alien'scomputer system. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is true I am acting on my personal beliefs, but I do not seehow I can do otherwise. <eos> <bos> DATA: He claims to be a twenty second century inventor, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, it appears the energy output <eos> <bos> DATA: To follow in your footsteps, as it were? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. I have established contact. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry. I did not know, <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are nearing the MS system. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warbird has completed its sensor sweep. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child. Captain's log, supplemental. I have just beenadvised of a highly unusual project undertaken by Commander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. I have found the place where they werestanding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shuttlecraft One to Enterprise. Prepare for docking sequence <eos> <bos> DATA: Congratulations, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls forthe environment are, therefore, not accessible. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the Captain is now his separate self, sir. Much of whathappened is naturally missing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Quite impossible. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true, but it was enough to get my attention. Later, Inoticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes. The intervalsbetween blinks were governed by the Fourier system, the samemathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern theappearance of randomness. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organise myfiles. <eos> <bos> DATA: Both epicentres are beneath the two southernmost drill sites,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are wrong, Geordi. I can. I do not need rest or diversion. Ishould not have been painting. I was negligent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been told that my playing is technically flawless, but noone has described it as beautiful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Well, sir, a good starting point may be, why was I given humanform? <eos> <bos> DATA: Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away, yet they donot appear to penetrate this breathable zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I must compliment you on your performance thisevening. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are moving out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle has reached the E region of the planet'sionosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, anAcademy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, I would say not. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which will bring us to the colony in three point two hours, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire, where are you from? <eos> <bos> DATA: My positronic brain is not capable of generating thoseconditions. Goodbye. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Sickbay. Medical emergency in main Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is why I must attempt this, sir. I have observed that inmost species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves. Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were to be damaged ordestroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successfulwith the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand therisk, sir. and I am prepared to accept the responsibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: I told a joke. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that not exactly what we were doing. <eos> <bos> DATA: So it would seem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: As they increase, it will become progressively more difficult tocontrol the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, configure a perimeter field charge,sections Nine K through Twelve T. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors indicate the communication originated from aterawatt source on the planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Professor Galen is still inside his vessel, sir. His vital signsare barely registering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you comfortable, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is evidence of some sort of disaster aboard the Enterprise,severe enough that the Captain ordered all hands to abandon ship. Ihave isolated three segments of the recording that are crucial. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a positive identification, Commander. It is the vesselthat attacked us earlier. It is re-entering the system at high velocityand is approaching Rana Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have uncovered several cases, sir, but wehave not yet completed our investigation. <eos> <bos> DATA: IF we maintain our current position, our shields should providesufficient protection. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for theeffect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We arestill picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable. At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have nothing to offer. There is not enough information uponwhich to base a hypothesis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the alien's. However, they are significantly less complex. Its cellular structureappears to be in a state of mitosis. <eos> <bos> DATA: I could attempt to remodulate the tricorder's delta-bandemissions. It should be possible to better control the temporalaperture. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we can determine the cause of these geological disturbances,we might be able to reverse the process. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison. Possibly a racewhich those life forms have planted here. Much as we plant humancolonies on Class-M planets. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. It consumes fuel to produce energy, it grows, it createsoffspring. By your definition, is it alive? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. However, the star's single planetfalls within the M-class range. It is capable of supporting life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the finallesson. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Both. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you all right, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I witnessed something remarkable. Individually they were both so <eos> <bos> DATA: However, I do have a request. <eos> <bos> DATA: Serova and Rabal believe there are regions ofpotential subspace instability within the Corridor. They believe thatif these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy, they willrupture. Subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I have recently reminded others, sir, I have no feeling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiate shuttle preflight sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energy flow is within normal parameters, from the pre-firechamber to the emission aperture. <eos> <bos> DATA: Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir. Eleven planets, unexplored. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe this is an information storage device. A crudeanalogue of our isolinear optical chip. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter symphony in C major, Bach'sBrandenburg Concerto number three, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, secondmovement, molto vivace and La Donna e Mobile from Verdi's Rigoletto. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortlyafter you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. It wassix months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formalpermission to court Counsellor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would bedishonourable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Could you postpone our departure for just five minutes, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel has assumed a position outside of the Rana system, andit is rapidly increasing velocity. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Apparently we do not. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Plot a course and take us back to Barradas Three. Notify the awayteam to prepare for transport. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Mother. Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

In theirlong history of war, the Romulans have rarely attacked first. Theyprefer to test their enemy's resolve. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship is strangely generalised in design. There is no specificbridge, no command centre. There is no engineering section. I canidentify no living quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. But it was a wonderful feeling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Too rich for my blood. <eos> <bos> DATA: The word excuses implies ulterior motives for a conflict. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe I have a partial explanation. I have completedmy analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporalconvergence in the space-time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would seem to be superstition. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard ordered me to escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are only as old as you feel. Try to remember that, boy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you will distract these people, I will attempt to depolarisethe power grid. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Geordi? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because I have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony,sir. It is coming from the cemetery. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted messagebank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates thattwenty seven priority Starfleet messages are missing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no platinum. Enterprise scanners did the rest. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, that is no longer the case. I have recently convertedmy interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation, which removed theperformance constraint. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you object to the question? <eos> <bos> DATA: In order for the deception to succeed, it would have to appear tobe a natural phenomenon. Verteron particles are artificial in nature. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodnight, Counsellor. Goodnight, Spot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ionisation pulse complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is being presented. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. It is not possible <eos> <bos> DATA: Inconclusive. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The Tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beaminto the upper atmosphere. The result is a hyperionisation thatvirtually disrupts all EM and subspace carriers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are approaching the designated coordinates. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am perfectly comfortable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you currently experiencing this phenomenon? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanning sensors) <eos> <bos> DATA: At current rate of acceleration, the shuttle will be destroyed intwenty eight seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it will set upresonances in my positronic subprocessors. I will receive theinformation on what you would call a subconscious level. <eos> <bos> DATA: The substance appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria,capable of doubling itself in size every fifteen minutes. It seems tobe reacting with two of the compounds present in the Enterprisestructure. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will see there are. I can even block them. <eos> <bos> DATA: All systems normal, sir. Sickbay reports that Lieutenant Juarezwent into labour at zero four hundred hours. We remain at stationawaiting the arrival of Starship Zhukov and guest quarters have beenprepared for Ambassador T'Pel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you should return to your quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but Tyrellian laser art is very similarin both form and composition. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, if indeed you have the power of Q. <eos> <bos> DATA: A bomb has been detonated by Ansataterrorists. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain, sir. The phenomenon is within visual range. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reactor Nine will reach critical in ten minutes, forty threeseconds. The subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction alongthe entire length of the Array, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I could replicate one for you. Computer, please replicate oneviola. <eos> <bos> DATA: We may never know what happens. If they succeed, we will not evenrealise that these events occurred. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard regrets detaining you, but it will be necessaryfor a while longer. In addition, I require access to your ship'scomputer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starbase one seven nine. We are ready to commence transfer. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have observed that the selection of food is often influenced bythe mood of the person ordering. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: I was not sent by your father. Circumstances demand that I takeyou into my confidence. I require your assistance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enhance, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: He can be reached at 221B Baker Street. <eos> <bos> DATA: More power, we risk losing life supportsystems. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos> <bos> DATA: Emissions now at thirty pulses per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: The power surge would cause a system failure in my internalprocessors and melt my primary power couplings. However, there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark threeone oh. It's the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly, but I will need to know the exact frequency and Icannot determine the risk to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am at a loss, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The use of the chime is unique, but not at all dissimilar tothe <eos> <bos> DATA: If you are correct, he must be warned. The device has beenmodified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue wouldbe highly toxic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Take this creature, for example. He does not exhibit any DNAstructure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alienpersonalities, in a sense, I am now empty. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have override control of her Bridge, Captain. All systemsanswering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: They're hailing us. <eos> <bos> DATA: The life support systems on the ship are failing, sir. Propulsion, navigation, and all communication, inoperative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings. However, since I have none, I would prefer you to be honest. Anartist's growth depends upon accurate feedback. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. <eos> <bos> DATA: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir,but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused anunusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot access internal sensors from here. We will have to go tothe Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Feline supplement one hundred twenty seven. Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designedfor your highly selective tastes. <eos> <bos> DATA: But he is more comfortable with me, sir. It is humanity he isfleeing. Sir, I can serve as an intermediary, a bridge back. A reminderof his obligations both to us and to Tin Man. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design asthe ships used by the Maquis. It is moving off. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears Ensign Tyler still has a crush on you. It is clear youdid not speak to her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the language of the contract seems carefully chosen to avoidany loopholes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accidentwhich claimed the lives of our officers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it is changing shape. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is it not true that had you refused to prosecute, Captain Louvoiswould have ruled summarily against me? <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Environmental systems fail to respond to command, Captain. Itappears the microbrain has successfully interfaced with our computers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Neural connections complete. I have access to the Borg subspacesignals. Processing. Processing. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is a very complex set of variables to coordinate, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA:  <eos> <bos> DATA: Typically, the purpose of such an enclosureis for storage. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I have discovered the basis of thecharges against Worf's father. Apparently the Klingons recentlycaptured a Romulan ship with logs that provided new information on theKhitomer attack. They clearly indicate a transmission from the outpostto the Romulan ship moments before the shields went down. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields will be down in eighteen seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an accepted custom that we wear clothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed thirty four additional tests and the resultshave been the same in each of them. Perhaps I was wrong in suspectingthe exocomp was alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is from Europe's Napoleonic era, sir. Late eighteenth, earlynineteenth centuries. This is a campaign headquarters tent, his uniformis that of a French Army marshal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I believe I have an explanation. According to the plasmaconversion sensor, the starboard engine has been in continuousoperation for forty seven days. <eos> <bos> DATA: In orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark threefive nine, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And then to outlive them as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: He's being grilled. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our help was not deliberate. You deceived us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Another lifeform. An ophidian. It seemsto be restricted by a forcefield. <eos> <bos> DATA: They routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am glad you approve, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments. They may provide a clue to my identity. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the quantum fissure we discoveredis a fixed point across the space time continuum. A keyhole whichintersects many other quantum realities. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not find that concept particularly appealing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I may know what has happened, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I do not believe we can offer any guarantees. We cansimply make the best choice we have at the moment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, message coming in from Tagra Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: The third ridge? <eos> <bos> DATA: We can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist withinthis nebula. After I have made further analysis, I may be able toadjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to La Forge. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand your reaction. But I do not wish to harm you. You orGarvin or anyone else. I only wish to help, to find a cure for theillness. I was very close. I must to continue my work, but it will taketime. How long until Skoran and the others return? <eos> <bos> DATA: Oh, we are us, sir, but they are also us. So indeed, we are bothus at different points along the same time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps someone wanted to draw us into the conflict. RO <eos> <bos> DATA: There he is, Commander. You were correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero zero six. <eos> <bos> DATA: Power couplings severed in forward phaser banks. Attempting tobypass. Controls not responding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the purpose of this gathering confuses me. <eos> <bos> DATA: And firing not on the new space station, but on the Bandi andtheir city. <eos> <bos> DATA: My childhood? <eos> <bos> DATA: Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do withmedical crosschecks? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Indri system was first identified by Federation vesselsnearly sixty years ago. The eighth planet is L-class. It is covered bydeciduous vegetation, unexplored, with no apparent evidence ofcivilisations, either present or past. The planet possesses no animallife whatsoever. <eos> <bos> DATA: The theory is simple. The shield bends light rays around theplanet's contour, similar to the Romulan cloaking device. But theimplementation is quite difficult. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, how is it that the Q can handle time and space so well, andus so badly? <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately thirty seconds. I have scanned the entire ship anddetected no life-threatening injuries among the crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: How can they? It is my body now. It is out of their hands. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe we can make the necessary modifications in mainEngineering, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo'scurrent whereabouts. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am relieved that the injuries I inflicted on you are notpermanent. <eos> <bos> DATA: But my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions thatare harmful, such as jealousy or hatred. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is this structure? <eos> <bos> DATA: The bifocal vision aid is typical of the era. The weapon is aforty five calibre double-action cavalry pistol invented by ColtFirearms in 1873. <eos> <bos> DATA: I had, sir. I will attempt to engage additional filteringelements. Visual re-established. <eos> <bos> DATA: Disappearances fitting the profile of the Hera have rarely endedwith the safe recovery of ship and crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe. I cannot have you confined to quarters for something you have not yet done. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is Lal. Lal, say hello to Counsellor Deanna Troi <eos> <bos> DATA: Recent events have left me puzzled, sir. It has been days sinceIshara left, and yet my thoughts seem to dwell on her. Almost as if Iwere experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. Perhaps it is my name. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is all right. <eos> <bos> DATA: Those appear to be power taps. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading a small pocket of vegetativelife. A primitive lichen growing in a fossilised seabed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will honour our agreement. <eos> <bos> DATA: Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two,prepare for docking. Level one precautions remain in effect. Shuttlehas cleared the Jovis cargo bay. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Please, I want more. <eos> <bos> DATA: The computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its owninterface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. If, on the other hand, the Captain makes even the slightesterror <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet personnel have vanished. Others may be at risk. We mustdo the best we can to find out why. However, I am strongly motivated tosolve this mystery. <eos> <bos> DATA: Objects appear approximately five hundred times their normalsize. As you can see, the cellular damage is quite extensive. However,based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity, I do notbelieve it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease. <eos> <bos> DATA: Good morning, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, we are approaching Klavdia Three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Precisely. <eos> <bos> DATA: The field emissions are particularly strong in this area. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will need to add a specific amount ofantimatter to rebalance and align the system. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. We no longer have the power to reproduce complexelements in the replicator. We must find a way to generate a violentenergy release without using conventional means. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not responding to ourhails. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, the cave in which we hid was made of rock which containedheavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. We surmise that theEntity was unable to penetrate that barrier. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot stop our graviton signal, Captain. Doctor Marr hasisolated the access code. <eos> <bos> DATA: Take us to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extremeshearing stress. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, Nuria is alone. <eos> <bos> DATA: And you suggest that anything which exhibits thesecharacteristics is considered alive? <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear the laser's drilling system was reprogrammed,sir. As soon as its memory bank received power, it turned itself on andwent after me. Fortunately, I was able to cope with it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrowevening. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: I think he deserves some leeway. Overruled. But that will bequite enough, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am programming the comm. system to scan the interferencepatterns, but a full analysis will take time. <eos> <bos> DATA: The T'Ong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three. They are accelerating to warp five. <eos> <bos> DATA: A happy ending. The mechanical man gets his wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, we cannot survive another hit. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are approaching Kalla Three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ice man? <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I am pleased to say it was damaged when I was forced to fireon Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growthactually occurring in module L seven three? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is self-repeating, of unknown pattern. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reproduction? <eos> <bos> DATA: If we do, we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitablelocation. <eos> <bos> DATA: I hope we are. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I offer you some refreshment, Chief? <eos> <bos> DATA: In the present context, what did she mean by bust him up? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I began by painting the image of theblacksmith. Then I painted the corridor. After that, the anvil, thehammer, and Doctor Soong's face. The thought then occurred to me that Ishould paint smoke. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps they were planning for the worst, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whetheror not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century? <eos> <bos> DATA: You are outnumbered, Mister Barclay. Say you will yield and itends here. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. From inside the Romulan Zone. We should be able to viewthe transmission. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor <eos> <bos> DATA: I have often wondered what it must be like to have one's mouthwater in anticipation of the arrival of a confection, or to feel thepleasure I have observed in humans as they consume it. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree Geordi. But the data matrix within the capsule does notcorrespond to any standard format. All we have been able to determineis that the device contains a chemically based system for molecularenergy encoding. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They areevolutionary holdovers, sequences of that provided key behaviouraland physical characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longernecessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gill slits and otheramphibious characteristics were derived from introns which stillcontain amphibious codes. <eos> <bos> DATA: No intruder noted by the sensors, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Doctor Soong? <eos> <bos> DATA: They are xenophobes, sir. Isolationists. The Paxans terraformed aprotoplanet in this system in order to better conceal theirwhereabouts. The apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trapdesigned to keep out invaders. The energy field stuns everyone on boardthe invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: They were more than my interpreters. They were also my friends. They were a part of me. I did not realise how much a part until now. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are always welcome, Captain. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be dead. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. The Captain would be ill advised to rely upon my judgement. <eos> <bos> DATA: The real secret is turning disadvantage to advantage. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and moreimportantly, for her to interact with her crewmates. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are slowing too, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: One moment, if you would. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I wouldbe happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience isany indication, he will need all the help he can get. Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performingfield tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. MisterWorf is supervising the exercises. <eos> <bos> DATA: Faster. Move to maximum speed. DATA <eos> <bos> DATA: The choice of meal is determined by individual taste. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are warning the dead, sir. Beware, a Klingon warrior isabout to arrive. <eos> <bos> DATA: The combinations totalling seven or eleven have considerablevalue when achieved on the primary attempt. With eight variationspossible to create those totals, the likelihood of those totalsoccurring is not significant. However <eos> <bos> DATA: That is what troubles me. I made no mistakes. I have conducted adiagnostic check of all of my programs. I am cross-checking with theship's computer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because the end result was unknown. The object could have beendangerous. It may in fact, be dangerous. <eos> <bos> DATA: On my way. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: These are the two planets which best matchour search criteria. Draygo Four features an unusually large temperatezone. However, it is within three light years of Cardassian space. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. The Alpha Omicron system is yet to be charted. Irecommend we take this opportunity for further research. <eos> <bos> DATA: An android. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors ofFederation territory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, may I see you in the ready room? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanning. The Fleming is near its previous coordinates. Itappears to be intact, but it is now within the rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes. <eos> <bos> DATA: But <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no need to apologise. I was not offended. Would you likea pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, may I ask your advice in a personal matter? <eos> <bos> DATA: Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off thenext tide. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twicefor disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. We found no malfunctions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our sensors can identify artificial lifeforms, sir. Apparently,he is capable of deceiving the sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: As apparently you do, Mister Clemens. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am conducting diagnostic <eos> <bos> DATA: They have been sitting here for three hours seventeen minutes. They refuse to transport back to the ship with the rest of Gowron'smen. They insisted on waiting here until they see Kahless again. Theirfaith appears to be unaffected by his inability to defeat Gowron. Theystill believe. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you had an off switch Doctor, would you not keep it secret? <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Geordi? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Learningsign will be a part of their process of learning how to live togetherin peace. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, but we have evolved beyond any need for yourassistance. This vessel has become too confining. We requirerelocation. Captain's log, supplemental. Doctor Stubbs has usedhis influence to have planet Kavis Alpha Four designated the new homeof the nanite civilisation. Commander Data's neural network has beenvacated. He has been returned to us unharmed. And with the help of thenanites, our computer core has been reconstructed in time for theexperiment <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: But the colony was destroyed. There were no survivors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? Was I making noise, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am different. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cancel separation sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Take him. <eos> <bos> DATA: Vamoose, you little varmint. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no unusual activity in the NelvanaSystem, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging. <eos> <bos> DATA: All vital signs returning to normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we have not regained control of thepropulsion systems. The bypass to the Bridge has been blocked. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Argus reactors are shutting down. We are no longerin danger, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I will need a few minutes to attend to a personalmatter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you also require the original logsrecorded during the attack, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Visual on, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Disengaging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlimited. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we can use phase buffers we may be able todevise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system whileit is in operation. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Probe on course. Sensors are functioning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up some unusualreadings from the Alpha Omicron system. At this range, all I am able todiscernis that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: If Counsellor Troi's supposition is correct,a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce themto reverse course, disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us toescape. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gravitational acceleration is also increasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe I am being helped by this session. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Oh, I do not feel envy. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot tell you anything beyond what I have already stated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dealer takes two. You control the bet, Lieutenant. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: We always come back to the human equation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Some form of passive resistance. Onlyeight were willing to consider evacuation. And of those eight <eos> <bos> DATA: Reconfigure hydrogen plasma mixture to include thirty percentnitrium. <eos> <bos> DATA: No life form reading, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How canI reproduce a sound with clay? <eos> <bos> DATA: And do you realise, Lore, that I am obligated to report all ofthis to our ship's Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Change in readings, sir. The life form has increased its energyoutput by fifty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will try, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does seem dormant, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: We know who you are. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to penetrate the Borgregenerative subcommand path. It is a low priority system and may beaccessible. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have not been entirely successful. <eos> <bos> DATA: In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should restore thebarriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their ownrealities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thruster is off. <eos> <bos> DATA: I advise against the use of phasers, sir. The gas buildup is toogreat. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have commented on the lack of senior officers available forthis mission. I believe my twenty six years of Starfleet servicequalifies me for such a post. However, if you do not believe the timehas arrived for an android to command a starship, perhaps I shouldaddress myself to improving my <eos> <bos> DATA: We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our abilities, andwe were prepared to continue studying the problem. But that was notsatisfactory. <eos> <bos> DATA: You got it, partner. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have unique skills that may allow me to succeed. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is improbable, but it is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you for your advice, but I'm trying to find two individualswith a snake. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reminded of a recent dream. This brace is reminiscent of <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The acoustics in Ten Forward are most favourable. <eos> <bos> DATA: What? <eos> <bos> DATA: Gather your belongings. It is time to leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: When we are ready to disconnect theinterface, we must allow enough time to lower the input levels,otherwise your nervous system will go into shock from the sudden dropin input. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe is moving with us, sir, holding relative position. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise and the warbird both appear to be trapped withinone of the temporal fragments. <eos> <bos> DATA: General quarters sounded, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, biolab four is one of the areas that will be floodedwith ion radiation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Timothy, your head movements are counterproductive. Can you bestill? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readoutvariables <eos> <bos> DATA: They seem to have made some technological leaps forward,Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: This station is inoperable, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am increasing the input now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Impulse engines are now at one hundred twenty five percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not possess the minute to minute remembrances of eachperson, although the more intense recollections are contained in mymemory banks. <eos> <bos> DATA: Good evening ladies and germs. I come from a town so small, we had a fractionfor a zip code. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no life readings, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watchedthree holodeck programs designed to behumourous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire bysubjecting myself to erotic imagery. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I do have something to gain from it. Your continued presenceon this ship. Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I am forced to attempt escape. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid I cannot answer that Wesley. And as you are anewcomer to the game, may I say it is inappropriate for you to ask. Iwill buy another card, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if theyhave been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across theentire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activityabove the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a stormsystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but not quite as perspicuously. <eos> <bos> DATA: A variety of crystilia. Their fragrance is an evolutionaryresponse to the acrid nature of the atmosphere on Telemarius Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, I am not under your nor anyone else's command. I haveresigned from Starfleet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enough? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will attempt it, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound duringtransport. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because our sensors are showing a responder echo, sir, on thefrequency they once used. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are sensing life-forms, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing makes me laugh. I wish to learn. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, create dance partner. Female. Begin music. <eos> <bos> DATA: In many ways, Deanna Troi is the friendthat I understand the least. Her life and her duties are predicated onher understanding and perception of emotions. Since I have none, nodoubt she finds me as much of a mystery as I find her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Undecided, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is released, sir. Force field is maintaining ourhull integrity. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I have offended. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. But humans still sneeze for other reasons and I cannot seemto do it right. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot verify that hypothesis. <eos> <bos> DATA: There appears to be an unusual power drain in the EPSdistribution net. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Query. What have I forgotten? <eos> <bos> DATA: I require a low intensity magnetic field core. I believe the ironmass of the anvil will provide that. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not your concern. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you referring to the Elway Theorem? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, prepare to transport me directly to the followingcoordinates. <eos> <bos> DATA: How now, spirit. Whither wander you? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. <eos> <bos> DATA: The question remains, why are they stealing these artefacts? <eos> <bos> DATA: We might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Admiral, when I created Lal, it was in the hope that someday shewould choose to enter the Academy and become a member of Starfleet. Iwanted to give something back in return for all Starfleet has given me. I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give herup. I cannot. It would violate every lesson I have learned about humanparenting. I have brought a new life into this world, and it is myduty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these first difficult stepsto maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be acontributing member of society. No one can relieve me from thatobligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am her father. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an unmapped system of six planets, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: A notably awkward experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, there is no indication of other Borg activity within sensorrange. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you get one the way I did, Lore, it will mean four years atthe Academy, another three as ensign, ten or twelve on varied spaceduty in the lieutenant grades. <eos> <bos> DATA: A second ship has joined the attack on the Bortas. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps her species has a perception that goes beyond lineartime. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be moving toward us, closing slowly. Its bearingindicates a possible collision course. <eos> <bos> DATA: But the Elway Theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate. Allresearch was abandoned by the mid-twenty third century. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is good to see you, too, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would take further research, but I believe to be effective onhumanoid crewmembers, humanoid antibodies would be necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing I have seen before. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe I know Mister Whitley. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are detecting a subspace distortion forming directlyahead of the Borg ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: The dilithium chamber shows no anomalousreadings. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will endeavour to speed up the process, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis, section by section. Trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed thecolony at Omicron Theta. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but only at extremely close range. Even at minimalspeed, it would be almost impossible to manoeuvre the Enterprisequickly enough to avoid them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, run transformational matrix calculations. Matchnavigational referents to known stars in this sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Light the torches to let them know that I am back. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, Lal gender sequence finalists. Begin. An Andorianfemale. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlikely, sir. Our records show that you supervised all Bandicontact with other worlds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I had no alternative. You would have destroyed the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed my study on the atmospheric variations whichhave occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: I hope Doctor Crusher was able to help you with your headache. <eos> <bos> DATA: Neither side intended Orelious Nine to be the decisive conflict. <eos> <bos> DATA: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Activating power pack, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have found Holmes' methodology of deductive reasoning tobe quite useful. One of his adages is that once you have eliminated theimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm afraid the contract could be interpreted in that way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. Although I considerthis woman's claim upon my ship to be an empty threat, it has furtherinspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is none present in the residue, either. <eos> <bos> DATA: I accept your challenge, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Three. The vehicle has suffered severedamage. Most of her systems have failed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am seeking advice in how <eos> <bos> DATA: The cruisers' weapons are powered up but sir, the Rekag ships areturning and heading out of sensor range. <eos> <bos> DATA: This Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Feline supplement seventy four. <eos> <bos> DATA: The possibility does exist, yet Gosheven seems unwilling toprepare for it. Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magicalrite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has beenaltered by the Borg. <eos> <bos> DATA: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shuttle's entering the lower ionosphere, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You always did love the sky. A stargazer. That is what you are. <eos> <bos> DATA: I find Lieutenant Worf to be what iscalled a kindred spirit. We were both orphans rescued by Starfleetofficers. In many ways, we are both still outsiders in human society. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker suggested this particular flower. He said it hadworked for him in the past. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. Are you planning on going into the holodeck? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been unable to find a single interpretation of the imagesI saw during the time I was shut down. The hammer, for instance, hasseveral meanings. The Klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol ofpower. However, the Taqua tribe of Nagor sees it as an icon of hearthand home. The Ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bridge, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. No need to beam me up,sir. The situation is under control. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shall I tell him, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. Starbase one two three has detected twoD'daridex class cruisers on an intercept course. The top speed of thisclass cruiser is known to be less than ours. Therefore we do have someadvantage. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. I believe you and I have something in common. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitonsinteract with the new engine core. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in the Betazed ceremony youmentioned. Could you tell us more? <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bridge to Transporter room two. Can you get a lock on the awayteam? <eos> <bos> DATA: Emissions now at ten pulses per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: Set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> DATA: His cellular structure does not conform toany known species. His bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporalflux. I do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Constantly, my friend. Particularly the humour. A man goes to astore to buy some kidneys. <eos> <bos> DATA: Channel is open, sir. Vorn responding to hail. <eos> <bos> DATA: Heavy damage to section twenty three A has cut off access toSickbay. I have ordered a security team to bring casualties here untilfurther notice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, someone in Engineering is attemptingto override the security system lockout. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tracking power from secondary systems. No surges to any of thetransporters indicated. <eos> <bos> DATA: The energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I would ask that you not require me to be more specific. I assure you, I have a good reason for asking. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, I am damaged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you sure? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid that is not possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was an excellent choice for them, Captain. They were able tocommunicate with me quite. I was about to say quite easily, but therewas nothing easy about it. Fortunately, they stopped short ofoverloading my circuitry. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gia. <eos> <bos> DATA: Should we not rerun it? <eos> <bos> DATA: This way, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called for me,urgent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it is separate and self-contained within the body ofthe dead life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: No life-form readings, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not consistent with what we know of them, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unable to locate any malfunction. All systems are operatingaccording to your design specifications. <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. The Captain is usually the last to leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Main power is offline. I am switching to backups. <eos> <bos> DATA: Less than exemplary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is a pattern emerging from the signals. <eos> <bos> DATA: My design models suggest that Beta will eventually experiencerising temperatures, erratic tide surges and in general the beginningsof global warming. <eos> <bos> DATA: The first incision is complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: The radiation signature is similar to the original pattern, butwith significant differences. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Captain, I am not certain I fully understand thisProspero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have thatwould improve my performance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two cases of Iresine syndrome on Hurada Three, at exactly thetime Tarmin and his group was there. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. I took advanced training in the operation of auxiliaryspace vessels at Starfleet Academy, where Ireceived <eos> <bos> DATA: Within each disturbance it appears that time is moving at adifferent rate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. It is not possible for me to be injured in thatfashion. <eos> <bos> DATA: But Counsellor, I do not have a <eos> <bos> DATA: This is interesting. The water table is a thin ribbon between thesandy surface layer and the rocks below. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would recommend against it, sir. There may be gravimetric ormagnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower theengines of a shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> DATA: Malfunction, I trust. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I would say Australopithecine. Each of these stages isanother link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to theorigins of all lifeforms on Earth. Because introns can include geneticmaterial from many different species over millions of years ofevolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations isoccurring among the crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: Radiation levels dropping back to normal, Captain. Energypatterns are breaking down, sir. The radiation signature is no longerstable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our attempt to transport the chair neveroccurred. <eos> <bos> DATA: My station is on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible the sensors were affected by interference from thewormhole, Commander. It is clearly not a class M planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yankee trader. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming into sensor range. <eos> <bos> DATA: That procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was inflight. <eos> <bos> DATA: Definitely not a single entity if that's what you mean, sir,although they know the Edo worship them as a god thing. <eos> <bos> DATA: The strain of this mission on Sarek has made it impossible. <eos> <bos> DATA: The destroyer has minimal shields. Their disruptor capacityappears to be only two point one megajoules. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I had another waking dream, sir. But this time, I had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image Isaw. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: There were no records of sleep disturbances of any kind,Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are beginning to overload. Ibelieve Serova's attempting to create a warp core breach. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Barzan probe had no way to recognisethis. Eventually, both sides will be unstable. <eos> <bos> DATA: The first Federation outpost was established thirty four yearsago on Boradis Three. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanicsand exobiology. <eos> <bos> DATA: The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on themoon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of thesignal, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The most probable explanation is that the glass came into contactwith an unshielded power source. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. I would like to consider you my friend as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating pre-launch sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is adequate oxygen for life support, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree with her, Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> DATA: She would not have told you anything. <eos> <bos> DATA: The consequences if we are caught <eos> <bos> DATA: I have it, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at thistime, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why should anyone wish to expend his time in such a search? <eos> <bos> DATA: Shuttlebay two, prepare for retrievalprocedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Most intriguing, sir. I assume a problem of inaccuratelytransmitted programmecoordinates due to the force field around the ship, sir. Are we alone,sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, yes. That does seem only fair. <eos> <bos> DATA: I fail to understand the value you place on my presence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. There is a twelve percentdecomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links. Thatsuggests the alloys are vulnerable to <eos> <bos> DATA: The mechanism appears to be jammed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warp field has collapsed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenaryship. I believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinatestaken from their navigational system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stargazer. Constellation Class. Starfleet Registry 2893. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to yourrequest for access to their databases. They are now being transmittedinto our computer over subspace link. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you are right, Counsellor. It is now up to us to playalong. Release inertial dampers and cut power to decks thirty onethrough thirty seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed, sir. In the story, the spirits used fear to motivateScrooge to reform his character. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, transfer power from warp engines to life support. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: That particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred andnineteen fatalities over a three day period. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thus far, that quality has not helped me to accomplish mymission. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no indication, Commander. I have no way to predict. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do understand, sir, that my interpretation of the symbolswill not be exact? <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twelve hours sixteen minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engines activated, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the transfer interface was not designed for thatconfiguration. It will take seven hours to make those changes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not necessarily true, Grandpa. I do have an off button,if you will. Its activation robs me of my consciousness, thereforerendering me dead for all intents and purposes. It is not something Ienjoy contemplating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire ship's complement is twohundred and thirty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready to transport. <eos> <bos> DATA: No changes, Commander. I can detect no abnormalities in thestar's radiant energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I am now prepared to dance at the wedding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: What type of device is this? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ishara. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that satisfactory? <eos> <bos> DATA: They are moving inter-dimensionally. Neither transporters norforcefields will contain them, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary messageentered into my static memory by Captain Picard. Geordi, are weplanning to fire on the alien habitat? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbanceon a small area of the planet's surface. Forty two degrees sevenminutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east. <eos> <bos> DATA: Talur is correct. You should rest. I will attend to your father. Gia, when did you begin wearing that pendant? <eos> <bos> DATA: You performed what Starfleet textbooks now refer to as the PicardManoeuvre. PICARD <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. No effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did itcome to be used in contemporary language? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it was Lieutenant Barclay. He appeared to be partiallytransformed into an arachnid. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears we are being probed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since there is no intelligent life, the question is by what? <eos> <bos> DATA: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am proceeding to the lab, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent whenhis first child was born. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors confirm design and specifications, Captain. Analysis ofhull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methodsof that time period. <eos> <bos> DATA: How did you decide? <eos> <bos> DATA: Every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history, onceit has elapsed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to approximately twopoint five million metric tonnes. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was so small in fact we didn't have a godfather of crime, wehad a nephew. Iwas so ugly as a child they hung a pork chop around my neck so the dog would play with me. And then there was thehuman cannonball who was hired and fired in the same night. Audienceprogramme off. Discontinue Comic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Quite true. I keep trying to be more human, and keep failing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I do. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension, it is oftenhelpful to find elements of commonality. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the current cannot be off downfrom this relay box. <eos> <bos> DATA: Also seen as a source of status and virility. Often a primeingredient in teenage mating rituals. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. It is a ruse. This way. <eos> <bos> DATA: What was the source of your jocular reaction? What was it youfound humorous? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. <eos> <bos> DATA: When I stroke the beard thusly, do I not appear moreintellectual? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, I have often wishedfor the sense that humans call intuition or instinct. Since Vulcans areincapable of lying, I must accept the Ambassador's explanation as thetruth, but I would still prefer a gut feeling to back up thisconclusion. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Denver's standard crew complement is twenty three, but they were transporting five hundred seventeen colonists to the Beloti sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much valueto possessing me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors,sir. A reversal of vowel and consonant, Barc to Broc. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aft. Outboard of the port nacelle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would take too long to explain. You and your family mustleave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop. That was the stun setting. This is not. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have returned. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Borg aspire to the perfection my Brother and I represent. Fully artificial life forms. We are their future. <eos> <bos> DATA: And how did you get here? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that wasappropriate. I have given a great deal of thought as to what isappropriate in this instance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard wanted no risk of our communications beingoverheard. You are to proceed now as he indicated. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are initiating visual contact, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is nothing wrong with the transporter. I have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. Captain's personal log. Although Commander Data hasassured me that his odd behaviour will return to normal, I can't helpthinking that something went wrong during his visit to Gravesworld. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot penetrate Borg power subcommandstructure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The number of systems now being affected bythe nodes has increased considerably. Sensors, engines, replicators,propulsion, they are all working together now, almost independently ofthe main computer. And the nodes link them all through the holodeck. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My calculations indicate <eos> <bos> DATA: That your interest in Kareen is not purely professional. Try asyou will, you cannot win her heart. She does not care for older men. Ormen of limited intellect. <eos> <bos> DATA: The barriers between quantum realties are breaking down. Otherrealties are emerging into our own. <eos> <bos> DATA: They say you will be doing this manually,sir. No automation. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you could tell us something about thenature of your mission. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only that it is the difference between night and day. <eos> <bos> DATA: But this is almost as if the laser drillseemed to operate itself with a will <eos> <bos> DATA: We have completed a scan of the planet surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Damage report. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Clemens, it is imperative that we continue our mission. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you attempted an audio analysis? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no need for an apology. Perhaps if you indulged in abrief rest period, you would be able to approach this problem with afresh point of view. <eos> <bos> DATA: How, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> DATA: But, but, Geordi, I was just about to revealthat the sir is in fact amadam <eos> <bos> DATA: Transceiver signal is down forty two percent. Navigational inputs are not registering. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear so. <eos> <bos> DATA: No other ship is indicated. <eos> <bos> DATA: What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to? <eos> <bos> DATA: We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip. CommanderRiker has speculated that it may be a Romulan transmission. I amattempting to track its source. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. If you wish, sir. But I ask if you'd take it asincontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, energy loss increasing to five percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: While suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed toFauvism, this quite inappropriately attempts tojuxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso and Leger. Inaddition, the use of colour suggests a haphazardmélange of clashing styles. Furthermore, the unsettling overtones ofproto-Vulcan influences <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, a Bajoran ship is approaching. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Brittain, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know what you mean. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Sheliak will not accept humans on their planet, And they willnot hesitate to use force to remove you. <eos> <bos> DATA: The strategy is built on a single premise. The hostile intent ofthe Romulans. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal. <eos> <bos> DATA: At warp nine, five hours twenty minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Communication lines have been terminated atthe transmitter, but I am quite certain the message was sent prior tothe interruption. <eos> <bos> DATA: Command functions are being rerouted, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Security. Send two officers toholodeck three. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bearing three one-six mark four twoDATA <eos> <bos> DATA: There should be a doorway. <eos> <bos> DATA: And light, as if they were made for women to use. <eos> <bos> DATA: Phase dampers are in synch. Standing by to modulate the transportpattern. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot be sure, sir, but I believe Manheim has developed amethod for harnessing energy from the pulsar. <eos> <bos> DATA: Strictly speaking, sir, it is not my playing. It is a preciseimitation of the techniques of Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bronken. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the wave's power signature is fluctuating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then perhaps there is a way I can access the machine, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Legends which are totally unsupported by fact, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Barradas Three is the only class M planet inthis system, and it is listed as unpopulated. However, sensors havedetected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: My positronic brain is a technology unknown to the Paxans. <eos> <bos> DATA: The scattering layer induced by the Tamarians is concentrated inthe upper D region. The shuttle will reach that area in approximatelytwo minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakleddemand or not. We can either use force or not. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, I am. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is an attainable goal, but it will require realigning thewarp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid offline. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: At that speed sir, we should arrive nine point six three hoursbehind the original schedule, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilogramsof ore in the Yridian hold. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dealer folds. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: And this is my attempt, with guidance from Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have your feelings for Chief O'Brien changed? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed the assembly of thereplicated anatomy. I was able to provide Lal with more realistic skinand eye colour than my own. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a fix on it, sir. Inside Captain Picard's quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have established a relay link with the sensor probe we left onthe perimeter of the Nebula. This is the convoy. We are expecting theMaquis attack force to cross the border from the Demilitarised Zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a likely hypothesis. The nomadic marauders who refer tothemselves as Gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouringsectors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. That is a particularly spellbinding subject. Inmost stars, the rare Earth element europium is enriched relative tosamarium and gadolinium <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately one hour forty five minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet Intelligence confirms that a shipmatching this configuration has been linked to raids on several otherplanets in this sector. For the short time it was within our visualrange, we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel. Itappears to be encased in an energy absorbing material. Although we cansee the ship, this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable toour long range sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Wesley's subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modifythe palm beacon. The optical burst patterns weprogrammed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects ofthe game. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know what I am. But I am not like you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have identified the vessel, Captain. It is the Batris, ageneral cargo vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: A monk, a clone and a Ferengi decideto go bowling together. <eos> <bos> DATA: Q says he has hurt his back. <eos> <bos> DATA: In order to do so, we would need to tie the ship's subspace fieldcoils into the transporter system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, that is extremely unwise. Worf may be much faster than <eos> <bos> DATA: Radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing fourteenthousand rads. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. We are ready, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are attempting to confuse me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I can help, Captain. I have been able to determine thatCommander La Forge was abducted by Romulans en route to Risa. It islikely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot toassassinate Governor Vagh. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am a Starfleet officer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: They would annihilate one other, causing a rupture in space. Ibelieve this is what happened in the Devron system. The rupture may besending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normalflow of time. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe this will produce the desired effect. I will use it todraw Worf to a another part of the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are dozens of Bajoran camps on thethree class-M planets. I suggest we may want to begin on Valo Three,where an adhoc leader named Jas Holza lives. The Federation has hadseveral dealings with him. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a symptom of cascade failure. It would requireinitialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you for your help, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was very thoughtful of him. I've been debating whether ornot to initiate another dream sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Removable? <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Zakdornian culture is replete with self-assuredness andconfidence. Seldom is it undeserved. For example, Kolrami is a thirdlevel grand master at the game of Strategema. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nagilum? <eos> <bos> DATA: The dispersion trail continues in this direction. Theconcentration gradient definitely increases along this vector. The escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortionfield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is the planet our probe detected in the T-taurisystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that what is known as a poker face? <eos> <bos> DATA: On the contrary, you have been a great deal of help. Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commencing graviton emissions now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you remember, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: This residue would be the waste left behind. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have run three complete self diagnostics. All of my systems arefunctioning normally. Perhaps Doctor Freud was correct. The knife Idreamed about is theembodiment of my unconscious desire to inflict violence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Give it to me or I will take it by force. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I am not giving you enough compliments? Your hair islooking particularly silky tonight. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ambassador Odan, Doctor Crusher. I was just on my way to speak toyou. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not without further study. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because you will lose their confidence? <eos> <bos> DATA: The first phaser blast will beapproximately nineteen seconds in duration. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is the exact number there should be. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am differentiating particle-emissionsignatures now. <eos> <bos> DATA: The prototype has been towed into position,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Replay at time index one four four. <eos> <bos> DATA: As well as our hydrogen collectors. Fond farewell. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see no other possible explanation. <eos> <bos> DATA: On a molecular genetic level? <eos> <bos> DATA: The nucleonic beam has ceased, Commander. The probe has shutdown. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. That would not be ethical. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suspect the last thing Counsellor Troi would have wanted is forthe two of you to be alienated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is your painting representative of something? <eos> <bos> DATA: Inquiry. You do not seem to be having as much difficultyadjusting to your current circumstances as the others. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have an explanation, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Step back, please. I believe I have found it. <eos> <bos> DATA: The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill downthrough the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up aseries of plasma infusion units. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the Pentharan spheral forecasts are correct, ten to twelvedegrees Celsius within the first ten days. <eos> <bos> DATA: He has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years, sir. Thelack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly. If you augment the thruster sequencing so that theinertial dampening fields <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have taken your suggestion regarding Spot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Back, sir? The Enterprise C would emerge in her own time periodat almost the same instant she left. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will feel nothing at all. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the particle fountain iscontinuing to surge. At the present rate, the radiation in the stationcore will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: The factions have been at war for fifteen centuries. <eos> <bos> DATA: The cards have been favouring the Lieutenant, but that is theresult of random chance, therefore, a temporary condition. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the stringfragment, rather the string's vibration. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would seem to be reasonable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, that was it, Geordi. This wakens a memory remnant of how thecolonists hoped to remain hidden, but their fear of being discoveredled to their storing information in me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have identified the signal. It is from the USSJenolen, a Federation transport ship reported missing in this sectorseventy five years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but I have no whiskey to give you. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, but triolic activity is increasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why have you stolen these objects? To put in a museum? <eos> <bos> DATA: Has studied, sir. Every case. As Holmes would've pointed out,during the time in question, something was afoot. <eos> <bos> DATA: And who are you, sir? Data to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you readme? <eos> <bos> DATA: We will return to the holodeck, where I will dare it to defeatme. And you, Madam, are invited to be a witness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that a failing in humans? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need muchpractice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Uxbridge house is coming into transporter range. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite. It isunlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excellent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no money. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you are trying to outperform the Intrepid. <eos> <bos> DATA: The rupture is eighty six percentclosed. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not true. I have no human feelings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, ship's sensors detect an abnormalenergy reading in the Captain's quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Everyone but myself was rendered unconscious. My positronicsystem is immune to the effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will have to continue this another time. End programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you foresee such a circumstance occurring? Is Ambassador Sarekunable to <eos> <bos> DATA: Spartan? <eos> <bos> DATA: Engage phasers and target. <eos> <bos> DATA: The initial cybernetic connection into Captain Picard's neuralnet pathways has been established. Mister O'Brien is ready to processthe Borg signal through the transport pattern buffer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why did you not return to the Potemkin with the others? 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: We are now two kilometres beneath the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: but I have no sexual desire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point where all the ideas and instincts of thisemerging intelligence are first expressed in some form. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a magnifying device based on your hand-held instrument. Ihave refined the design to increase the magnification level. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then may I say your perturbation becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serveQueen and country. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is my conclusion as well, Commander. Two shuttlecraft,staggered between the Enterprise and the Raman, with their shieldsadjusted to refocus the tractor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached theCardassian vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be following us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our originalposition. <eos> <bos> DATA: All evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what itproposes. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are currently attempting to isolate the corrupt circuitpathways. I reckon the process should take less then two hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: That could make socialisation more difficult. A human male. <eos> <bos> DATA: I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of apast about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curiousto learn more about it. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I said before, these are all images I originally experiencedin my dreamprogramme. I do not have a rational explanation for them. <eos> <bos> DATA: You told a joke. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading a massive explosion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, did no one try to adjust their programming? <eos> <bos> DATA: I thought it might be significant, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Level-five probe sequence ready for launch, Commander. On yourmark. <eos> <bos> DATA: Such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedbackmotivators. Unfortunately, I have been less than successful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Warp and impulse engines are down, sir, but they can berestarted. A skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase. <eos> <bos> DATA: Imprecise, Lieutenant. They omittedcertain truths, which in itself tells us something. <eos> <bos> DATA: Less than five thousand kilometres, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that at this distance we are unable to distinguishthe pod from the inorganic matter normally present in space. <eos> <bos> DATA: But we have established that this is not a holograph. If I stepthrough and investigate, we could determine whether it is truly agateway. <eos> <bos> DATA: Course plotted. Adjust pitch to twenty seven point three degrees. Set heading one eight zero <eos> <bos> DATA: For whatever finds us, my dear Watson. <eos> <bos> DATA: Activate Bussard collector. <eos> <bos> DATA: The cigar, of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are within two kilometres of the magmapocket. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, what we just heard is impossible. <eos> <bos> DATA: You lived with the colonists? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, he is reading as fully human. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to seewhat happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions. <eos> <bos> DATA: We meant no harm. We were exploring. <eos> <bos> DATA: The code is valid. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I not behaving as a solicitous mate? <eos> <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are ventingdrive plasma. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos> <bos> DATA: When Data speaks for me, can you hear my anguish, my despair? Data is a fine machine, but he cannot take the place of my chorus. Ittook years to develop a communication. That cannot be easily replaced. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are ready, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Using multimodal reflection sorting, I havebeen able to detect a complex series of subspace signals betweenLocutus and the Borg ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields have registered an impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: The source of the distress signal appears to be coming from upthere, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why was it not detected earlier? <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I welcome the opportunity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Commander, but removing any of these people againsttheir will would be a violation of several Starfleet regulations, notthe least of which would be the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I help you, Mister Remmick? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: La Forge, I got the Intrepid's power conversion levels up toninety seven point one percent. Maybe you should try cleaning yourplasma grid once in a while. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds andimpact on the planet eleven seconds later. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emitan inverse tachyon pulse, which could scan beyond the subspace barrier. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I may be of some assistance. Captain Scott is unawareof the existence of synthehol. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gia, I would like you to accompany me to the village. I will needsome supplies. <eos> <bos> DATA: You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in theuniverse. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realised I mightbe encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility existsthat I was no longer alone. For that reason, I. The exocomp hasreturned. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understandingof its function. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I'm fine. <eos> <bos> DATA: I came to apologise, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, Starbase one three three has no record at all of a DoctorDalen Quaice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with yourperformance as First Officer. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is likely that we overestimated the geologic stability aroundthe CO2 pockets, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were motionless for three minutes eleven seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have scanned the entire Prytt communications system. Thisappears to be the primary access module for the central government. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. She is also beginning to show signs of the illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sorry, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: My internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems arefunctioning within normal parameters. For the forty seven seconds thatI was inactive, there is no record of cognitive activity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a problem with the engines? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Half metre to the right, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf has programmed our replicators to make a verygood approximation of Klingon bloodwine. I believe you will find it toyour liking. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should continue this discussionnext week <eos> <bos> DATA: We are at ninety percent of tolerance. Mycalculations show you will reach one hundred percent of tolerancebefore you are in range of the Hera. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant Barclay being referred toclandestinely as a vegetable? <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we separate and blend in with thesebeings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: The district he represents is called the Krocton segment. Hemaintains a dwelling there. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have analysed the control module in theprimary weather control grid. It appears the station is experiencing asystem wide power failure. <eos> <bos> DATA: The unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigationa hazardous one. A probe launched from our current position would bemore advisable. <eos> <bos> DATA: None of these people are emitting life signs. <eos> <bos> DATA: In what way, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. The Starfleet officers who first activated me on OmicronTheta told me I was an android, nothing more than a sophisticatedmachine with human form. However I realised that if I were simply amachine, I could never be anything else. I could never grow beyond myprogramming. I found that difficult to accept, so I chose to believethat I was a person, that I had the potential to be more than acollection of circuits and subprocessors. It is a belief which I stillhold. <eos> <bos> DATA: Humans are mortal. They seem to need a sense of continuity. <eos> <bos> DATA: That does not apply. I simply want to know what is funny. I wantto be able to involve myself in other people's laughter. I wish to joinin. <eos> <bos> DATA: It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I deactivated Data and transferred my mind into his frame. Inever imagined how much of my self I would retain. My feelings, mydreams. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: She was killed in the line of duty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, you have anticipated my denouement. However, thesentiment is appreciated. I will continue. Oh, Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display Connote a fairly well developed cognitive array. And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is dead. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aftshields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Raise shields. Red alert. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you know where she went? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is theirfavourite on the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, approaching Starbase one threethree. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. <eos> <bos> DATA: We've regained ship's communication, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults. It was notmeant as a serious disparagement. <eos> <bos> DATA: How do you know that, Ambassador? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will attempt to do so. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have much to learn. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I have analysed the residue from the explosions. This is ofno known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. When Tin Man returned me to the Enterprise, Irealised this is where I belong. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

It describes the Empire as being highly advanced andpowerful, and capable of actually moving stars. <eos> <bos> DATA: Speculation. Could it be alive? <eos> <bos> DATA: The shuttle escape transporter should provide enough power tobeam us <eos> <bos> DATA: What do you feel, Lal? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: I find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time. Thearbitration will continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: Considering the exceptionally long lifespan of Vulcans, it doesseem odd that Sarek and Spock did not choose to resolve thosedifferences in the time allowed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it is Vandor Four, a planetoid in ellipticalorbit around the binary system. <eos> <bos> DATA: No doubt you have applied your technology from other industriesto the refinement of this product. <eos> <bos> DATA: Forever curious, this urge to compete. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: How could you tell? <eos> <bos> DATA: We should be arriving at Earth in ten hours sixteen minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suppose I have learned to be creative, sir, when necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warship is approaching from high orbit. It is very closethree hundred thousand kilometres distant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien, stand by for transport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who? You don't mean Doctor Noonien Soong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fajo was in the right place at the righttime just when we needed him most. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay here, Geordi. Data.  TIMOTHY <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're all dead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their advanced technology could provide no solution. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd think they'd at least give us a hint. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You honestly think Q is telling the truth? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. There is an antique revolving door. It could be anentrance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Uncertain. The signal was interrupted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare for precision <eos> <bos> RIKER: That was you, of course, Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man,bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand thatyour people needed peace to ensure their future. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No one's seen him. The replicator in his quarters has not beenused. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Greek, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Heavy casualties in the secondary hull. Navigational sensorarray inoperative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think she's a governess. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He'd never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought the Tarellians were all dead What are the poor devilsdoing here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You go ahead. I'll be finished by the time you get back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen, Night Bird. One, two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the human race. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A blood test, a tissue sample, anything thatwould have a sample of Doctor Pulaski's original DNA. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Vulcans haven't figure out what these fragments are butthey've determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever they are, Troi's convincedthey're human. They may be trapped somehow. We're not sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! No, don't! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's impossible. Soong's dead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. May I be excused now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bortas is standing by, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid that won't be possible. Last night, Jono attackedCaptain Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I can distract Orton for a few seconds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's ridiculous. When did I have a chance? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Halt. I know this perfect little vacation spot. In fact, itfalls within the coordinates of this sector. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How much longer do we have? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, he hated it. That's why he left the chore to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see, where were we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which brings up the question of how do we get Junior off thehull once we get there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like a song reminds you of an old friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This time you've got me. I haven't a clue. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status? Anything changed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is he now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've also got some volcanic activity. Pretty severe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have a problem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to re-enterRomulan space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He had a good student. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay with them. Riker to O'Brien. Can you get a fix on theCaptain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have a feeling there's more to it than just pleasing us, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you also familiar with the terms I agreed to keep you boyson the Enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical? <eos> <bos> RIKER: P for Picard! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand down from Red Alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't make this too easy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess we'll have to take that chance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. I'm just trying to trace her steps. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll explain that later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And I didn't even catch it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but your outpost is in imminentdanger of attack. I would like to station security personnel on thesurface for your protection. Now, I'm ordering you to drop yourshields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought I might. Would you like to join me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you say so. I don't remember the old Geordi having that muchsuccess with Miss Christi Henshaw. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was a smash. We got a standing ovation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have some gaps in the aft shields, Captain. When thetorpedoes explode, these areas will be contaminated withion radiation. We need to evacuate sections twenty four to forty seven,decks thirty five through thirty eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields are down to three percent. We're diverting allavailable power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security teams, stand by. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were just talking about you, Wyatt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. Concentrate shields at that point. Make it so. I hopeyou're right, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our mediator is very self assured. We'll know soon enough if hecan deliver. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you mind telling me what that is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think he's on to you, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a message coming in for you from thesurface. It's coded personal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want a computer science lesson, Data. Bottom line. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm here for the briefing, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you all right, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're still waiting for us to make up our minds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A complete analysis of our bid is availableon the ship's computer for your consideration. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. Wewon't cause you any more trouble. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wonder how many of the crew are buried back there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why don't we wait and see who comes out on top. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off theplanet instead of me, don't you think he would have made the samechoices that I made? I just don't want you to be hurt again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope so, for their sake. ) <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, the game is five card stud, nothing wild. Ante up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Better than prison? There are officers who wait years to serveon this ship. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold fast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have a better idea, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. How's it coming? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't maintain power. We don't have the time. Prepare tofire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the main Bridge, the command centreof the Enterprise and our last stop. Vash, Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was just trying to imagine a hell-bent for leather youngofficer insulting a Nausicaan twice his size. I wish I'd had a chanceto know that Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Certainly that can wait until we've recovered the survivors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A cloaking device of some sort, to hide the entire base? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You hope you never do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He promises the method of execution will bemost painful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mrs Troi, I have to ask you to clear the Bridge, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't be so quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot biggerthan yours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or if they need to recharge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They seem normal enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineered? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All he wanted to know about was previous starships. What Ithought was innovative about the last Enterprise, the one before that. He said he wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't recall hearing of a Federation officer serving ever on aKlingon vessel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock on tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right behind you. Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6. We are on a longreach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which hasyet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the timeto further detail the charts of this region. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open shuttlebay doors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're sounding like a private eye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was Lore, sir. Same facial twitches that we've seen allalong. Lying unconscious on the floor exactly as Data had described. But then it suddenly became violent, apparently sensing that Wesley andI were present. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From the look of it the Borg are born as biological life form. It seems that almost immediately after birth they begin artificialimplants. Apparently the Borg have developed the technology <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when this crew is revived? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any sign of the Essex? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need help. I don't want to be at the mercyof these hallucinations any more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's like candy to them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have to agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do,but the risk is too great. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Only you could have noticed something like that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you askedfor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you say the discontinuities started to occur afteryou returned from a Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their range of influence appears to beconcentrated in the Medical Lab, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got to find her, if she's still alive. Data, scan theKlingon central net. See if there's any record of her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No objection, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. But I guess I got over it. You're here. Resume. It'simportant to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data ? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. Setcourse for 'audet Nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standing by, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Helm, prepare for warp three. Heading two hundred andninety four mark thirty seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It would be my pleasure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the computer systems? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley. I am looking forward tohearing about it. But not right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Seasoned. That's a horrible thing to say to a man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That was too easy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, override security lock on thisdoor. Authorisation, Riker alpha six zero. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We lost Tasha on an away team under my command. The thought ofthe same thing happening to her sister <eos> <bos> RIKER: They appear to be in some kind of stasis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tailor made for their enemies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I prefer the company of equals. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll see to that, and to your accommodations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The T'Pau is missing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You seem awfully tense for a man who just came back fromvacation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And now it's too late. For you, that is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Scan the sector. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Move over. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it's all right, Lieutenant. Those are the Edo we met before. They certainly are fit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As in Tam Elbrun of the Ghorusda disaster? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well it doesn't matter. Once Picard makes his decision, doesanyone question it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any reason why it shouldn't be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long until they're fully conscious? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You used them as slave labourers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I knew what I was supposed to do and I didn't do it. If thosehad real bat'leths I might be dead right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere and I'mready to take it onto the ship. If you would like to take a couple ofdays off, I'll run the interface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And then Lore came along. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With your permission? Mister Data, a stolen transport vessel hasdeparted from Lunar Five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Flattered, sort of. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't that familiar to me. Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He usually is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computerhas been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world toour computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you're trying to motivate us to find <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which might start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war,and we still might not be able to save the captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Zorn. Can you hear me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a possibility. It would have to be perfectly timed, andthere's no guarantee. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all this interference it could be a hundred metres away andwe wouldn't know it. This could take hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long wayto go. A long way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It didn't spare everyone, Doctor. If you'll check your reports,you'll find that two of the colonists didn't survive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, transporter room three. Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I waited a long time. I guess I can wait a little longer. Take care of her. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Go deck by deck if you have to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What changed your mind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't use photon torpedoes. An explosion this close couldcripple us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. It's good to see you again, Captain. It's been a longtime. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reverse engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, is it the same ship we faced at J two five? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're too close. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you remember how we all felt when Tasha died? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got a man held hostage by alien forcesand all I have are no-option options. I need some input. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is urgent. Come in, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you have me at a disadvantage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could we blow it into pieces? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They found her, didn't they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Mister Worf, you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there anything we can do here to adapt to our current defencesystems? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My guess would be a lone survey ship. Maybe a dozen or sosurvivors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Atmosphere? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We must have come full circle, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unfortunately. Let's find the others. What do you make of these? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't. I'm prevented from that by a promise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. I think we have. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twenty three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The dead one, I'm afraid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right on schedule. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive,Sir. I would like to make one suggestion, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's gone, Captain. We can abort the auto-destruct. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll see. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When we saw it this time, he seemed to be struggling, fightingit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir, <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be right back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A sensor echo, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm looking forward to reading your report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, we've got eight or nine minutes at most. Can you finish bythen? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we know we'll pick up that word the next time through? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, location of Doctor BeverlyCrusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley, this meeting is not for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, shut off the music! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Switch, now! Enterprise to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the other one, his assistant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't the containment field hold? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How about until next time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance sexualpleasure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you nailed down our little hiccup yet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously they need our help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Am I disturbing you?  WORF <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or you could have been intimidated. It's tough to tell otherpeople what to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it's free. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll arrive about an hour before the storm gets there. It willtake at least two hours to evacuate all the colonists off the surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd never survive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dan, it's me. It's Will Riker. I was here yesterday, remember? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to one third impulse power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You are from a different time, aren't you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whoa, wait a minute. We've got to coordinate our efforts herefirst. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're going to take me whether I want to go or not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If they pull down our shields, we're helpless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. Quark. I see you remember me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What have you got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Area affected? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm positive. After everything that I've experienced, I don'tthink I could sleep knowing it was still up. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Use that fancy <eos> <bos> RIKER: And that gave you the right to assault us, to rob us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any reason she shouldn't feel welcome here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need replacement personnel, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that all? I thought you'd been walking around with that smileon your face a lot longer than that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are others who would like to visit here, if you would giveus a limit on the numbers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think this is a random occurrence. I think there's apurpose here. A reason. What, I don't know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when we drop our shields, the Calamarains go after Q again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's just trying to eliminate the possibility that one of youmight be carrying an organism that was harmful to Deanna. I'm not implying that you did anything intentional. I'm just trying toget to the bottom of the mystery. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not now, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I might. It depends. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I always hated you for that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't that gagh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My colleagues, where are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're entering the Legaran system, sir. Shall I have Mister Worf contact their ambassador? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The good times? The first time we met you, you put us on trialfor the crimes of humanity. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hail the Tamarian ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think a lot about what happened, especially on that last day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you and Casey get up here. Let's get to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, that large mass to port may contain an assimilator. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. Admiral. I am in no condition to negotiate with theRomulans or with anyone else. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice job, Geordi.>RIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My favourite part of dinner. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me take her with me. She can go back to the Enterprise. Wewould give her asylum. You would never have to see her again. Thatwould solve the problem, wouldn't it? You'd be rid of her. She wouldnever be able to influence anyone again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's my testimony and it's the truth. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's working. The radiation levels are dropping to normal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like a rag in a dog's mouth. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I have an idea what the rules are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want your command. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You bet. Dying is bad enough but, to lose my sense of humour? Forget it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have you on our viewer, pilot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, adjust course for any deviations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm not intruding, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The replicators on decks four through nine are producing nothingbut cat food. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In a manner of speaking he is. I'm not going to be disturbinghim, I'll just give him the message. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is more important than Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long have you known that you were like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, I want you to assemble a security team, take a shuttledown to the planet, bring back the captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. Time to intercept? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, get him out of there! <eos> <bos> RIKER: But our sensors were malfunctioning. Our probe clearlyestablished the planet could not support life. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I'd be a liar if I said I felt like myself. I've had to bitemy tongue to keep from snapping at people. A couple of times, I've goneto my quarters and felt as if there was someone in there, waiting forme. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which, leaves us with only one conclusion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, please. Leave me alone! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm glad to hear you say so, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what happened to the Captain and Doctor Crusher? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Listen. This has been educational but I make it a policy neverto open another man's gift. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we are, it will be in battle, and I will die with you. So Irepeat, cloaking shields off! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am beginning to remember certain things. Why am I here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need more speed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At least ten more minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which reports do not conflict? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Half impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There areRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Run a maintenance sweep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you read that, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think there's any possibility ofdeveloping sites in this region. Most of the stars are main sequencebinaries. There are no M-class planets. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been able to get by for a long time without seeing him. I'm not about to start now. What made you contact him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My broken arm. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement, you've got agift for understatement. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll have our Chief Engineer show you to his Engine Room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kansas City. No, wait. New Orleans. Bourbon Street Bar, NewOrleans. Around two a. m. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will he survive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How close is it to the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reflection therapy? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire torpedo. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we shouldassume the initiative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Estimated time? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, but they knew who their enemy was better than we do. Theymay have known what caused the trouble. They just didn't know how toget out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So who have you got so far? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Belay that order, Captain. I'll bring her in manually. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bok is trying to use his transporter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But you said their sensors didn't work in this tunnel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would give him authorised access to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you trying to fill another inside straight, Worf? Don't sayI didn't warn you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Charming fellow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship. No one would know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've stabilised life support. Mister La Forgeis working on restoring the main power couplings, but that'll taketime. It's a real mess down here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm on my way. You'llhave to handle this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do. Things are a little more complicated than I had planned,but there's nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what Iwant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got to find a way to track him. What about thehigh-resolution EM scans? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Uncertain. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She needs the transporter to get the boy back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No time for courtesy. Get the damned control chips back inplace, in the correct order. Now! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know this is all very confusing to you so I'll attempt toexplain. You are on the starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Riker to transporter room two. Prepare for emergencytransport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great. Set course. Velocity warp two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to push that barge into the Gamelan sun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Block their transporter with the shields! Extend to maximumrange! <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're some kind of magnetometric guidedcharges. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on the ore and fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we lose antimatter containment <eos> <bos> RIKER: We went through some serious times. Do you really think we'regoing to find the Pegasus again? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kahlest. Who was she? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not much. <eos> <bos> RIKER: More basic than that. What was he? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing for Ficus. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good luck, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Admiral on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're scowling, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell does that mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: For the next time we encounter the Tamarians? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then why are you acting so excited? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander William Riker of the Enterprise. Identifyyourself. I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot. Identifyyourself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, we're going to have to depend on each other if we're goingto get through this, okay? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's just that our mental pathways have become accustomed toyour sensory input patterns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who does he think he is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Before Uhnari died or after? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where the hell is he? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? What's the matter? Why can't he leave? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't know where they came from? Where they are now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particlesin the star. There's nothing left to take out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can that be? The Professor's data depends on <eos> <bos> RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I see. May I ask how long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even you wouldn't be that cruel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker. Our emergency teams are on boardyour ship. Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's our acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse andtop warp speed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. If you'll excuse me, sir. Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm First Officer William Riker,Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors seemed to think there was. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where's Captain Picard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drop your shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I still have a phaser. Why do I still have a phaser? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is this an official report, Lieutenant?  LAFORGE <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will it take you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it's around here somewhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like you've made a friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, yourtouch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and thinkseem so real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. Ensign, take us in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! That's not what you said. You said I can't. You used acontraction, didn't you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How was it, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm fine. You look a little tired, Doctor Beverly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. If we stay on our present course, we should rendezvous withher intended groom in thirty one hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We found your on the bulkheads and the console. We know youwere there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very tasty. So tell us, Lwaxana. The last time we met, you werelooking for a husband. Did you have any luck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There was a moment when you smiled. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get some rest. You've had a rough couple of days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't know that the exocomps are life forms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I should apologise, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have a mother ship who should be advised of yourcondition?  PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Dokaychin? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We weren't sure how we would be received. Director Mandl wasless than enthusiastic about our interest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm another case for the medical journals, then. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Medical emergency. Deck seventeen, section three alpha. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the Bortas is Gowron's ship. If he's the legitimateleader of the Empire, shouldn't we help him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently he was so anxious to be join the awayteam, he left a very critical experiment unattended. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd hate to have to scrap her. Starfleet could certainly useanother ship, even if she is old. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're never going to feel good about this war. None of us will. But we've got to complete our mission. I've been doing a littleresearch, trying to find out about William T Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your point of view, not mine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? This trip to Starbase Five One Five israther unexpected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If this is a knife, what happened to Mavek? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you give us an idea of its heading? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What, do you think I'm going to try to escape? What would thatget me? You've already got her. Besides, where would I go? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lunch. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've lost contact with our ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What I don't understand, sir, is how Karnasknew you were still available. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The hell you don't. You're two moves away from being mated. See,you should have listened to me. Now you've only got one possibleescape. That wasn't it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or the away team's tricorders. Right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Troi, I don't know how to tell you this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wantsanswered. He suggested that I take you with me on the away team I'll beleading. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Because of a man you once knew named Penthar-Mul. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Eternity never looked so lovely. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you able to pinpoint the source of their particle beam? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We all are, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bought out the Ferengi yet, Ral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's heading for the planet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whose emotions were they? I thought you said were alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aren't we all. But you sent out a Mayday? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are we doing back here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: T'Pel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. You're talking about killing Deanna! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is second-hand merchandise. You wouldn't want him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The colonists are all on board, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look who's here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you realise what you're saying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is she serious? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, stay together! Stay together! This way! This way! This way! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you sure? You've always said it's a chess game with theRomulans. Move, counter move, guile and deceit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wouldn't that bring about chaos? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rotate shield frequencies. Data, report? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did who say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only way to find out is to go back down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know where I can find them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, you said I reckon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gul Lemec has arrived. He's waiting for youin the Observation Lounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I like to think that I've lightened up a little in my old age. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what's going on down there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Since the pod is so small, it will be difficult to detect. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Current position? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's like the eye of a hurricane. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand that you think it's necessary. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. I'd better go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One of us could beam into the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wes, remember our purpose is to improvise,RIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like my first year at the Academy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you prepared to use them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe it's about time we found out. Could we use the phasers tomelt down the shell of the comet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But I assume you could revive us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most important. You may want to start with something like this here. You are the mostbeautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing you can do will change the fact that I'm innocent. I'mnot crazy. I'm not <eos> <bos> RIKER: But it is prudent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know where they went? So you know whothey are and you know where I can find them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Minister. Now, if you'll excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, is there any health risk to Counsellor Troi if thefoetus is aborted? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I do. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Charming woman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm familiar with the game. Go on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got to get out of here, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley! <eos> <bos> RIKER: The next time we saw you, you asked me to join the Q Continuum. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: A total surprise. Apparently a member of one of the factionsdidn't like the idea of peace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This planet. What do you call it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. How did that feel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Absolutely. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you been able to remember anything that happened after heattacked you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In any case, a trading situation developed which still exists. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Speed being the most obvious. This ship literally just thinkswhat it wants, and then it happens. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We thought that since you're going to the same conference, youmight like to beam down with the other delegates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Still sounds better than pea soup. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Return to the Enterprise, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How would that help? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Explain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me. You're entitled to that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like you've got a control logic lockout in your regulatorsubsystem. I'm going to attempt to run an activebypass through the plasma flow convertor. You, start runningphase-lock feedback through that regulator. I want about a six seconddelay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't me. I wasn't the one who closed the door. I didn'tproposition her and I certainly didn't try to rape her. Why are youdoing this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, no. Minutes is fine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, we've got twenty two minutes. I want some options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How close are we on that transporter? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Frightening, isn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you, Mister Data, bear a striking resemblance to Friar Tuck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He'd better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll see about getting main power back online. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi's uniform. <eos> <bos> RIKER: His career. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For thirty hours? It would never take you more than four. You'reincapable of that level of incompetence, Mister La Forge. Worf, wheredid you get that scar? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If that is Uhnari, where's Rocha? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess I'm not surprised to hear that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it's changed intensity, it can't possibly be a protostar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're a quick study. This is it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, sir. It was either this or arguing till hell frozeover. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what is going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And a marshal outranks even an Admiral Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was pretty much as we expected, sir. Nosurvivors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Riker on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pair of threes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That is the firomactal drive unit. It controls the ramistat coreand also keeps the ontarian manifold at forty thousand KRGs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we set up some sort of relay system? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Main viewer on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster thanexpected. He was pleased that I'd noticed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not if I weaken first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a long story, sir, but I'm sure it doesn't have anything todo with this accident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lavelle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Injector status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which brings up a very serious possibility. What if there's anoutside influence at work here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: for it was such a badly written book, filledwith endless cliché and shallow characters. I shall welcome death whenit comes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, thank you. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alpha Onias three. The Enterprise had been probed. Geordi, Worf,and I transported down to track the source. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm going to head for those trees overthere. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise, we're taking her in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That is enough, Counsellor. Deanna. I'm sorry. This is not aboutrevenge. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight fornothing. Somebody has to answer for that. Then I can mourn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It killed Malencon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we disengage the pulse? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, request permission to board on the Yamato with an awayteam. Perhaps something we can find on board in the logs will help usfigure out what happened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Meaning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your exact message. Bon voyage mon ami. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the matter with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even if it involves my father. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Riker. Go ahead, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And then you became part of their crew? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lied to you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you aware of the infectious nature of the parasites whichinhabit cove palm? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we're going to be all right in here. I'm not sure aboutthe air supply, so stay put, don't move around. Don't expendunnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thingout. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The storm is going to interfere with communications. Everythingwill need to be coordinated from the surface. Mister Data, you willcoordinate the evacuation of the colonists. Doctor, they have ninepatients in the outpost infirmary. Your first priority will be to getthem to Sickbay. After that you will stay on board the Enterprise, beready to receive casualties. Marquez, you will take some people downand track the storm. All the other teams will need to be kept apprisedof its heading. Commander, you're in charge of deploying thedeflectors. Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could this be some sort of tissue regeneration? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll have to move fast. If we need to stun one of the guards,the Borg will know right away that he's been hurt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Watch that door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's about Lieutenant Commander Daren. As a department head, shecomes to me for systems allocation, personnel transfers, things likethat. I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable with her requests. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this all about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That should have put our boy to sleep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. Admiral, Deanna, I need a moment with you. CommanderData, if you would accompany the Ambassador on his tour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all Ican do. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I checked into her record, too. Her last posting was on DeribenFive. I spoke to her commanding officer there. He said she wasargumentative, quick to take offence. He also told me he transferredher to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts. Tobe honest, I'm having trouble believing her story, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In order to do thatRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why don't we get this over with? I'll call your three, and I'llraise you anything you've got left. Well? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why don't you join us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fifty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're wondering what we're going to do next. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, identify the occupant of the detention cell. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not going to be me. He's made that abundantly clear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's nothing compared to what our Captain will do when he findsout you've broken our landing party agreement. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a good thing one of these pockets didn't pass through aphoton torpedo casing or the matter-antimatter containment pods. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if the Romulans are already aware of the tachyon field, theyshould run the blockade at that point. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I may suggest, sir, that first leap out of our galaxy was, ashe said, a mistake. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise'll be there, sir. Maybe a little late, but we'llbe there, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There never are, Lieutenant. I'm going to trust your expertise. Secure your stations. Stand by for my signal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. Congratulations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're in position now, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am Commander Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Wewill evacuate you and give you medical care. You will not be harmed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we can't be certain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Says who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know what to do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shouldn't we assume that he is alive until it's been provedotherwise? We cannot just abandon him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you repair them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm trying. You need a bigger head. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, maybe. The point is, I didn't get the chance. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase eightyseven, warp five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Admiral Picard. Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, deactivate all command functions. Authorisation, RikerOmega Three <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, at least now we have something to go on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not all I want, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro Laren. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dimensions, Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One down, Captain <eos> <bos> RIKER: Two kilometres north of the away team's beam-down point. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd love, to but I have other plans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's older than the comet itself. Could someone from theD'Arsay system have built it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: nuqneH. qaleghneS. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They haven't been able to maintain reliable communications sincetheir government fell apart. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that what those are? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Snips and snails and puppy dog tails? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then do so. Lieutenant Yar was confused. We no longer enslaveanimals for food purposes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Children of Tama. I've heard rumours about them for years. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any known instance of Romulans using E-bandcommunications? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise? Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you put us on the bridge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damnsignal. It's bouncing around more than we are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which has to do with another law that we must obey. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, you act as if there's a connection between the timedistortion and the distress signal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand you've been talking to every shuttlepilot on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface. A witness said they saw you vaporised. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Except that they know they've got us in deep trouble. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's worth a try. I'll check the replicator activity logs. Eighteen hours is a long time to go without food. Or without someoneseeing him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. O'Brien, lock onto Ishara and get her out of here! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I realise that, Mister Data. I'd rather face a court martialthan live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths. Commander Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I were, I'm sure you'll be the first to know. Poker's atseventeen hundred hours in my quarters. Deck eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Power up the photons, Mister Worf. Alert me when they're ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. I'll release her, of course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Old friends. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You want to clone us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's he doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Alpha moon? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riva! 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: What brought this up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Preflight underway. Counting to clearance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: See if that did the trick. No, it's not working. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're the one who said it. While we're at it, this isn't partof any human future. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's also one other thing, a diary with only <eos> <bos> RIKER: The forms are very similar. Do that move again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The southern polar region. That's where Datatried to move the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know what you thought you were doingin there, but you were way out of line. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ventilation and life support are failing at random spots allover the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not going to be any easier tomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches and Bularian canapés. Areyou up for a promotion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. I can barely keep my eyes open. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why should we petition to entry to an empire that no longerexists? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rossa? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The transmission that we intercepted was probably a homingsignal. We have to assume they're on their way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I see. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Rightnow, your duty's here on the Bridge. TROI <eos> <bos> RIKER: In the Marta community on the southern continent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, starship Enterprise. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us out of here. Full impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is this Corvallen now? I'm under orders to acquire somemagnesite. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. All of them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll be coming into orbit of Vulcan in lessthan an hour, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do we know the source of their transporter beam? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Calm down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where's Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No bother, Doctor Bernard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you offering to help us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As his ship was destroyed, he'll be using one of our shuttles. <eos> <bos> RIKER: About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He could have killed you. He didn't. Maybe the end begins withone boy putting down his gun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. Actually it feels quite comfortable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And use it as an aiming point and blow our Captain to bits? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Destroy that probe! <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did you do it, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we have to take the risk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At your command, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Continue with the testing, Mister Worf. Here's the finalschedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers. By theway, I'm looking forward to meeting your parents. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're no match for the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No extraterrestrial source ever used this code? <eos> <bos> RIKER: None of it makes any sense. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hail on all frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I remember studying his career in school. The treaty of Alpha Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission to theFederation, the Klingon Alliance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos> <bos> RIKER: He was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him. I don'tunderstand why he wanted <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't miss it for the world. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who are you? What is your part in all this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've only been there once, but they've got this great club. Idon't remember the name of it. They serve these blue concoctions <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look, we're not here to make accusations. We're trying to findout what happened. Commander Morag is due here in two hours. Let's seewhat he has to say. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't enjoyed it, if that's what you mean. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you feel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand. Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which would suggest they also have the ability to communicatewith us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How much do you remember? <eos> <bos> RIKER: DaiMon Tog, I thought the Krayton left orbit hours ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare firing sequencing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We invite your petition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, this is a battle simulation. You're my Tactical Officer. I've discussed this with Geordi and we agreed. You need to be at myside. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, put us in high equatorial orbit. Scan for survivors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going alone, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

It's not real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's an object of some kind closing in on our position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drive who away, Groppler? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Do you hear me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wonder if one doesn't have to have age and wisdom toappreciate that, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First officer to Captain. Ready withthe away personnel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it true that he'll be retiring after this mission? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Advise Doctor Crusher we have a medicalemergency. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are not impressed by your magic tricks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are your replicators? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Doctor showed it to me, too. Rather harmless-looking thing,I thought. <eos> <bos> RIKER: End simulation. Something told me you wouldn't let this go. Congratulations. You passed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time? Not possible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I might have said RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: American. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gin'tak? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As I said, all dead. Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading theresearch information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I amconcerned at being in such close orbit, but the Tsiolkovsky's researchrecords will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm going back for Captain Picard. MisterWorf, assemble an Away team to accompany me to the surface. Doctor, Ineed to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A shield? What kind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand any of this. Who are these people? What areyou doing involved with them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know what happened to them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Custody? On what charge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Orton may be improvising. Maybe he didn't plan to take ushostage so early and now he doesn't know what to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's more than just a cloak. It changes the structure of matter. In theory, a ship using this device could pass through normal matter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we weren't over there, where the hell were we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. I was just held up for a while. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you two seal the chamber. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you be interested in selling me the ore you're carrying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. You're dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Speak softly, Governor. Those who cannot hear an angry shout maystrain to hear a whisper. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we transmit visually. Do yourespond? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, we're way ahead of schedule. Alter course for AlphaOmicron. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This just isn't you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Release control of this ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what ship is carrying the envoy? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just positive ones, sir. Actually, I just welcomed Ensign Mendonon board. He certainly seems eager to please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew evaluation reports? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Neutral, and uninvolved, sir, in virtually all interstellarmatters of consequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Automaton. Made. By whom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no proof of anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So much for the cease fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whoa. If we're going to get out of here, you're going to have totrust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you gethere? My name is Will. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where did they get their shields? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The method of attrition must take a little getting used to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've never explained my orders before. I'mnot about to start now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain has decided to go with your recommendation, butthat's not the point. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. I don't know what youdid, sir, but it looks like everything's back to normal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Thinkhow many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here nowlike this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame? Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carrythe bitterness on another generation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you think this quantum fissure is nothingthat we need to worry about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate no life forms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But I think I'm about to find out. Stand by. What shall I call you? Ethan? Jean-Luc? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are there any messages missing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to thearrangements. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or did we step from one Bridge onto another Bridge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we can throw away the visor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security, all decks yellow alert. Possible intruder. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should loosen things up a little bit, meet in a lessofficial capacity. How about a friendly game of poker? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for anexperience that's primitive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where will that take us, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's on your mind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, what are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: With this new extricator, sir, we caneliminate three more bulky machines from cargo space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advancenavigation at the Academy provides the student with three options. Ricewas given this test, rejected their options and offered one of his own. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trappedhere. We're in no immediate dangerRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: By all means. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Might be dangerous. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So the Hera's in one piece somewhere out there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's happening? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have no problem getting to sleep. Then Ithink I'm sleeping all night. When I wake up, I feel exhausted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, you and Miss Henshaw have been seeing a lot of each other. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's Commander Riker, sir! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to any team leader. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are the Cardassians ready for a war? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shut up! <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, you're right, Data. The ship's computer would be moreefficient, but it wouldn't allow for the subtlety needed for greatcooking. It would give you all of the ingredients in pre-determinedmeasurements, but wouldn't allow for flair or individuality. And Data,as we both know, flair is what marks the difference between artistryand mere competence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the dayafter tomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everybody stay here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise is going to try to interceptthe Sheliak colony ship. Your job well, you know what your job is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Disintegrated? How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All transporter rooms are standing by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what about the men? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security, allow them access into cargo bay four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I didn't know you better, I'd say that you wereprocrastinating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course, Captain Kargan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We think we should take a look for ourselves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange to have him transported on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. We'll take it back to the ship with us. Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45. Despite havingonly a few hours in which to explore Data's home planet we'vediscovered something which may explain Data's beginnings, if we canproperly assemble and communicate with what we've found. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Boost the confinement beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. Shealready knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was doing some repairs under the station when an earthquakehit. I got caught in a rockslide. I had to set it myself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. We experienced some kind of loop where everythingrepeats itself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No? How do I strike you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She was working, but she said she would be Speak ofthe devil. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. Your behaviour has been erratic. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did they send the right shuttle? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Admiral. Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What can you tell us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isolation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where do we find them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is he? Wait here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take five. Throw them away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It could be Morag. We don't know for sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alexander, can you hear me? Alexander? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, that's enough! <eos> <bos> RIKER: There you go. A little something for you, Ziggy. A littlesomething for those cocktail waitresses. Why don't you run thisoutside, give it to the parking lot attendants. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I tried talking to you yesterday on the station. You wouldn'thear me out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What would cause something like this? Because it started at thesame time we encountered the anomaly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not yet. Geordi thinks that'll be ready by oh eight hundredhours tomorrow. But before that, we should see if we can balance thisengine. Can you access the starboard manifold thrust? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if the government doesn't survive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Federation Starship Enterprise. Ensign, call security. Iwant an escort for this man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status, Ensign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will we have, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going try to access their main computer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We've almost reached the nacelle tube. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm your commanding officer. I'm giving you adirect order. Understood? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We should have an engine core ready for them by nineteen hundredhours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First time navigating through a globular cluster, Ensign? Youhave got to compensate for gravimetric interference before <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure we'd know. One does not patronise a Klingon warrior. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We might regret this. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is ridiculous. You're beginning to see conspiracieseverywhere. We were invited here by the Kes. Why would we allyourselves with the Prytt? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's more power than our entire ship can generate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, it's going to be a late night. Would you like to havesome dinner first? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get offthis ship. Are there any others survivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One final request, sir. Permission to beam a box of Data'sChinese finger puzzles over to the Ferengi. A thank you for all theytried to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're receiving a distress signal from aCardassian ship near the Demilitarised Zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your impression of the fieldmodulator, Mister Lote? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're having trouble reading you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And of course your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry isunmatched. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and Counsellor Troi are completelyqualified. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think it represents? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But the disappearance of Mark Twain, one of the most notedliterary figures of the nineteenth century <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should all get together. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were going to mention something else? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'm not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I never knew any of that about him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer. There's a power reduction in section L-Ninety Four. Explain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. What is this allabout? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What is theirpurpose? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Belay my previous order, Mister Data. Therewill now be only three to beam up. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At warp two? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. We can't put him through any further risk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Manual restart sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your file says that you're an <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, one more time. The ramistat kiloquadcapacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio timesthe sum of the plasma injector quotient. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. I know it's been a long time since we've beentogether, and I know your feelings have changed. Mine haven't. I can'tjust give up. I'd like to be with you again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the ultraviolet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: how long before they cross over into Federation territory? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll look this over later. Go ahead. You run your diagnostic. I'll inform the other departments about the power systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Fleming's last contact with Starfleetwas four days ago. According to them, there was nothing out of theordinary when they entered the Corridor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're a very lovely young lady. But none of this is real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's find another way out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Full stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's their heading, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've picked up a vessel on the long range scanners, headed thisway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This Bridge should be four decks above us. What's going on here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aren't you going to answer that, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hey! Imzadi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Enterprise. Return our personnel or face immediatereprisal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been down there dozens of times. I know my way around. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Save it. We're getting out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Probably just as well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds like my superintendent. When I was at the Academy, we hada Vulcan Superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of everysingle cadet. He knew everything about them. It was like having yourparents around all the time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Chief. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coming apart, Chief. We've got to do it now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Crystalline Entity paid us a visit. We lost two colonists,but we got the rest in here. Captain's log, stardate 45122.3. We have notifiedStarfleet Command of our intention to pursue and investigate theCrystalline Entity. To that end, we have been joined by Doctor KilaMarr, a xenologist who has made studying the Entity her life's work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever it is you're doing out there,you've got to stop it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're scanning Sector twenty one five oh five now. There's stillno sign of the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good idea. <eos> <bos> RIKER: one seven zero one D Enterprise shuttlecraft five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can't do that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any word from La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Out of range? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That means the atmosphere of the planet would instantly rush in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll discuss it later, Mister Data. Doctor, you're coming withus, too. You need to get to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that any less reasonable than being magically transformed toanother place by the Picard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Display Volnoth's birth record again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He will have the protection of the Seldonis Convention. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think they mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not a Klingon. I don't think there's any shame in someone being injured. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And for the last thirty eight years I havesurvived here. I have come to understand that the alien contaminatorscreated this place for me out of some sense of guilt, presuming thatthe novel we had on board the shuttle about the Hotel Royale was infact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits. Obviously,they thought this was the world from which I came. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have I mentioned how imaginative the Risian women are, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, yourFirst Officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will stepoutside follow Lieutenant Lewis. He will assign you to your crewquarters. Ensign, you're here on the exchangeprogramme. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Traveller's gone, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I join you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like these Gatherers weren't too discriminating in whatthey steal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you callenhancement, you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockoutlike you doing in a computer-generated joint like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it's over? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? You were reported headed for <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you picked it up on the sensors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your zoo? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gul Evek wants to meet with you to discuss the situation onthe surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You send Mistress Beata our regrets. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Easy. Easy. Engage. Captain Okona, shut down your engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, stay sharp. We may have to get out of there in ahurry. Set phasers on stun. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. It's for my meeting with Beata. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are our channels secure on your end? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead andjust leave it at that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But if we could get further away, increase the deflector'srange. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, where is Lieutenant La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, extend shields around shuttle one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there someone in particular that you're talking about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope it's complete. Much of my decision will be based on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador? We've received word from theSeronian and the Rekag delegates. They've agreed to meet with you inDarthen tomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What could do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien says the weapon was in a state of discharge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your honour, we'll stipulate to all of this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Surprised? I don't know what you're talking about. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if I don't? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe they were part of the Borg collective. One ofthem referred to himself as I. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When the train comes in, everybody rides. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. How do you think we handled this before? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn, you are ambitious, aren't you, Shelby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coming to heading three four zero mark one zero. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Parthas? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Memory loss? What are you talking about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All went well on Starbase twelve. I think you'll find the shipto be in splendid condition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it had no way to reach us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You got called into the superintendent's office? That's a storyI'd like to hear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, wait a second. Thank you, MisterWorf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't need explanations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We sympathise with your situation, but what you ask is notpossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They have the ability to analyse and adapt, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's too much of a risk. I'll take that course when it's thelast one left. Who the hell are these people? There's got to be some way to get through to them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! <eos> <bos> RIKER: If Worf's right, then our arrival would be an uncomfortablereminder of the facts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're on pad two. I've set a ten second delay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The shuttle is <eos> <bos> RIKER: You handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With pleasure, sir. Ensign Crusher, set course for Emila Two,warp three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But I'm afraid we're going to have to find our solution withouthistory's greatest Consulting Detective. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. Set course for the Devron system, maximum warp. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Masquerading as a god? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And nothing you or anyone else can say will change that. And I won't let you or anyone else tell me that I am. You may be ableto destroy my mind, but you can't change the fact that I'm innocent. Ididn't kill that man! And that's what's driving you crazy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here's your fifty. And ten more. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you hear an echo? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander? That's quite formal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want to take any unnecessary chances. If they get intotrouble, beam them up immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That damn ringing. Answer it, will you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is Captain Picard all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We should probably get you to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will want to <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enough to power a small phaser bank, a subspace relay station,or <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Apgar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What good would that do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did you say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we can relax, Mister Worf. They can't even move theirship without our help. We certainly have them outmanned and outgunned. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Captain, we may have foundsomething. There's a file of memory <eos> <bos> RIKER: The exercise is over! <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. You can't just snatch people and put them in your fantasiesand expect them to respond. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No you can't. Don't even try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock sensors on Nuria. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't that a little risky? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The hell there isn't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But what happened to my memory? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Was that the orange one with the lumpy skin? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's too great a risk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you sure? Because I get the sense you're feeling pretty noble about the whole thing. Look at me, aren't I courageous? Aren't I an honourable Klingon? Let me remind you of something. A Klingon does not put his desires above those of his family or his friends. How many people on this ship consider you a friend? How many owe you their lives? Have you ever thought about how you've affected the people around you? How we might feel about your dying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Problem, Commander? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Notify the transporter room I have fourteen to beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, if we shut down that means we're going to be bringingdown the shields, and we're hanging nose to nose with a Romulan battlecruiser. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. I felt trapped by the console. But it wasn't like this. There was something else here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what's the best way to go aboutfinding Ramsey and the other survivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Difficult decision. Yes, I can do that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Poker? Is that a game of some sort? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and prepare to beam us directly toSickbay, but hang on for my signal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It still hurts. It's bleeding again. Why? You just healed it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Under the circumstances, sir, I think you're right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take him to a detention cell, Mister Worf, and notify Starfleetthat we'll be dropping him off at Starbase two one four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we risk going in there to get them out? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about me? Did you see one of those mouths on my head aswell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They took this path. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You went back to the Enterprise for that? Wes, you cheated. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't you understand his incredible gift to me? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't ask me about surprises. Ask Tam Elbrun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's okay. I guess I really wasn't paying attention. I'd bettergo to Sickbay. We'll continue this later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all, Groppler. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's no wonder, with all this going on. Try to relax. This is a confession given by me, Jean-LucPicard, commanding Stargazer, in the hopes that my belated honestywill be taken into account by Starfleet when judging my actions duringa confrontation with an unidentified vessel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Top of the line. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course you wouldn't. But Napoleonic equipment on an alienplanet. One so different it has twin moons? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What kind of needs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Without the battle of the sexes you probably don't have as manyarguments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker out. Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space,it'll be a few days before Starfleet can get any ships here. Untilthen, we're on our own. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The rematerialisation subroutine has been disabled. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The particles are being routed through the transporter systeminto cargo bay five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No ship's crew in sight. No sign ofmechanism or circuitry. No controls or read-outs. This is nothing likeany vessel I've seen before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailingfrequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He was the most one in the group. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Womencarry the baby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vibration? We're not talking about a violin, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We came a long way to get him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What doyou want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do we return their fire, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One more thing. I will conduct the mediations today, but at theend of today, regardless of the outcome, I must be removed from Riker'sbody. Even if the new host has not arrived. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the problem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold your position, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Adjust target coordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Likewise. Good luck, Admiral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to lock on tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You wanted to see me, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's your father. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Full stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Turbolifts two, three, four, everyone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know I didn't get the wrong room. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any signs of life, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have every right to detain him, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But her version puts a noose around my neck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's an order, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Er. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This structure was apparently made toresemble twentieth century Earth. All efforts to exit have failed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, how can you look inside that, analyse the decompositionwithout <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Picard Manoeuvre. What is the defence against that, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have the ophidian. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know Data's been doing considerable research on Doctor Soong'sbackground. Let's be sure. Wesley, would you look in on Commander Data? Discreetly? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This man's taken, get your own? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? That's the last thing I expected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's assuming an attack posture. Don't be surprised if <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All stations secure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go to impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She would have to be to get by on Camor Five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're on a timetable here. Where's Ro? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak consider humans a lower life form. They would haveno compunctions about exterminating the intruders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We didn't want to inconvenience you. We've made arrangements forquarters on the planet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. Admiral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's seal off this entrance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've heard of him. I don't know that any of us have <eos> <bos> RIKER: How's Lieutenant Suna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see it, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It really is delicious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's moving, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You had a strange way of showing it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you do the same thing with the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your name? Tell me you love jazz. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your Persian flaw. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. Saved by the bell. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you were willing to settle for second. Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It certainly will. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was strange. I felt as if he didn't even recognise me,although I was with him just the other day when I supervised the tuberefit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Boarding or disembarking? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incoming transmission from the Romulancommand ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, back off. Well, would anyone else like to speak up? Orshall we end this charade? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But for now, stand by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, contact all ships in this sector to rendezvousand join us in relief efforts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you increase phaser power? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And risk a war? <eos> <bos> RIKER: D'Amato's been an exemplary officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just hoping this isn't the usual way our missions will go, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any truth in what he's saying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've lost port thrusters <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, ready photon torpedoes. Set to detonate on impactwith the Promellian vessel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Romulan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How much protection will this cave give us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All he's got left are his manoeuvring jets,Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're not going to make it, Captain. If we had just a minute orso. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Same one I've always had. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you fix it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a run of the mill happening, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're lucky we didn't end up half way across the galaxy in themiddle of next week. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're picking up an energy field on the planetsurface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've brought the Sovereign of Acamar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's no weapon. The Enterprise has no reason to do that,especially with me on board. It makes no sense. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Care to lend a hand? Sit at Ops. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very impressive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you hear me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many morejolts like that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Resume course and speed. Scanners at maximumrange. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One jumps off a cliff, they all jump off? Data, is it possibleto plant a command into the Borg collective consciousness? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know, sir, I must report it to Starfleet. That's at least onefull day for subspace communications to reach there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't see anything through here. Theunderbrush is too thick. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This looks like anything but farmland. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. Your message said you'd suffered a failure in yourengine core. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did she say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Where's your crew? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I'm surprised at you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lanel, I really have to get going. All the other aliens arewaiting for me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My life was on the main Bridge. Always has been. If anything'sgoing to jog my memory. Main Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How are you examining them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps Geordi should give them something they want. Somethingimportant. Then we simply create the right moment for him to take itaway, and get him the hell out of there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So I've gathered. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What type of radiation signature? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you give us enough power to get us out of here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. Make sure you take all this junk with you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. This one'sgetting away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I. I'm not sure what I'm feeling. What's on your mind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Goodnight. Captain's log, supplemental. The third transportwindow has opened and the away team is making their final attempt atretrieving the database. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Probably just a symptom of stage fright. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something I can help you with, Mister Remmick? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I had cosmetic surgery to correct a genetic birth defect. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How's it going? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forty-eight minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, I think that third wave should be in position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope it's enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At least we can pull them out of orbit before they enter theatmosphere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would I seem ungrateful if I ask for some information? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, the Counsellor and I are needed on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure Belt. Heavy concentrations ofhyperonic radiation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought that I might show you your quarters first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I never did anything to stand in his way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. We're a rescue party. We picked up your colony's distresscall and we came as fast as we could. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The wave is gaining on us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint the source of the Borgtransmission? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There was no direct contact with the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't think the Pakleds had that kind of technology. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you like to go again? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've disabled the system temporarily. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gul Lemec, as you know. the systems are still subject tonegotiation by the terms of the treaty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Without knowing what he did, that'll be tough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell is he doing? Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby, you'll lead the away team. Make it so. First officer's log, stardate 43998.5. Our pursuitof the Borg continues on a course that will take us to the very core ofthe Federation. The devastation they could bring is beyond imagination. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Uh oh. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ended it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is she, Q? You can forget your game if Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to know how. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about energy readings? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever it was it seems something Data doesn't want to tell usabout. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander La Forge, Commander Leijten, report to theBridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where will I find Commander Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc. Two to transport. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Initiating computer task hand-off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly, I want you. If you're going to leave, you'd better goright now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you feel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's incredible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Completely calm, no sound, no movement, yeta few hundred metres away a storm is raging. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The difference in ages between you and Davies is not the issuehere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The star is still collapsing. We're directlyin the path of <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is what you're thinking possible? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. I'll do what I can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I said I wouldn't mind the assignment, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How are you doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The last port of call of the Lantree was the Darwin GeneticResearch Station on Gagarin Four three days ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know who did this to you, or why, but it can change. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we should meet him here. Keep him under our control. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm just a little dizzy. I'll be fine. I just need to liedown. PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a risk. We're not sure how stable the rift will be. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. <eos> <bos> RIKER: These weapons were taken from two of yourpeople who were loitering out of sight in the vicinity of the Selaydelegation quarters. Would you care to explain, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They were adamant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No matter you can say will the fact that I'm innocent! I'm notcrazy! I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did Manheim give you enough information todecipher the security code? <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all respect, Captain, I want to beam over there. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Frozen. How many? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That secret hiding place of yours? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That doesn't mean his life is over. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was caught in the riots when the police moved in. It's thelast thing I remember. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It looks like we're going to have to head into to the ArgusArray. This is the third time this year it's stopped relaying data. Starfleet's beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. Iwant you to start a long range scan once we get. Lieutenant? Are youlistening to me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range ofseveral Federation outposts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is not a case of simple fatigue. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we should assume the worst, that everyone on the Bridgeis dead. There'sno one is in control of the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to half impulse, and take us into orbit above the thirdplanet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're the chef? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set heading for Starbase Five One Five, warp nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Steady on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we do this, we have to do it fast the Romulans will be withinsensor range in less than a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do we know where these things came from, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There is a solution. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, my friend, I know what you want. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Since then, the Federation has colonised several planets in thatsector. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's been a lot of seismic activity over the years. If theservo-links were damaged we may not be able to. I'll try to tap intothe command pathways. You see if you can access and disable the fileserver. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought they were supposed to be back online yesterday. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's our poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat foryou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the strangest feeling. My whole legjust went dead. Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1. During ageological survey on Surata Four, Commander Riker has become infectedby an unidentified microbe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything willreturn to <eos> <bos> RIKER: You disagree with me, fine. You need to take it to the Captain,then fine. Through me. You do an end run around me again, I'll snap youback so hard, you'll think you're a first year cadet again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't really think I'm going to help you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's time, sir. We should go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do the best you can, Data. Let's just hope we can get thesection we need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to search the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the shuttle pilot who's on duty is Lieutenant Hayes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. We killed them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's been a cave-in in one of the magma pockets. You'reneeded in transporter room two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And are those scholars saying the Ferengi may not unlike us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, who won the contest? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We still won't have our shields restored by then. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. I'm Commander William Riker from the FederationStarship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. The name of my ship is the Lollipop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Split pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmedinto the replicators. Well? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know the Captain's orders, Lieutenant. Engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll try not to take you literally. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm glad we got you back, Geordi. We're going to need your helpon this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twelve hundred hours. Alpha shift isrelieved. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything we know about them is based on rumour or conjecture. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what the hell is going on here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's hard to play from in here. I can't even see the wholeboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But you have the practical experience, Wes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, be careful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So the crew wakes up and thinks they've been through a wormhole,count their blessings and keep going. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First load ready, Mister O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain's log? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. It's just it's been a long time. Captain Jean-Luc Picard,Admiral Erik Pressman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will remove the burden of that responsibility right now. Myrelationship with Deanna stands very well on its own without any helpfrom you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just wanted to broaden his horizons. Besides, he likes it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I suggest we move to a safer location. It couldreappear at any moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you make of this, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pursuit? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How will you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long can we maintain communication? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call the cavalry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Halt! Don't fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. What's your estimate on the engines,Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll need your advice and recommendations. As you know, I'vebeen given the responsibility of overseeing Wesley's education. Tofurther that goal, I would like to put him in charge of the planetarymineral surveys. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Station keeping. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've established a synchronous orbit over the drillingsite. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've reached the designated coordinates,but the M-class planet, it's gone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but by that time both of them had been found out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said she was adopted. Could she be an alien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Warp two, helm. Heading five seven mark three onenine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Close to forty kilometres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He couldn't understand why I did it. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But it's <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, he was joking. You know that, right? Data? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Captain, we're entering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're pulling back to a safe distance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock on the Captain, bring him back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, their minds are set. They don't want to hear anotheralternative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Glad you're here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But why? Unless there's something they want us somethingthey need us to see. Wait a minute. Data, the containment fieldstrength is down to eighteen percent. Can you stabilise it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine, fine, Enterprise out! <eos> <bos> RIKER: You enjoyed that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, identify Riker, William T. Accesscode theta alpha two seven three seven, blue, enable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Manoeuvre sequence delta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What we're facing is neither a person nor a place. At least notyet. It's time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty ninewho know nothing about it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fascinating, the advanced materials used in constructing thisspace station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I've heard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How could a ship disappear from your depot? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was Doctor Crusher's idea to simulate theblue gill. We had to make sure it would fool everyone, including you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I meant on your shore leave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice work, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starfleet can't make its move until we'reout of the Demilitarised Zone. We're to break formation and take coverin the Nebula as soon as they appear. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, run comparison of known phenomena. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, put the turbolifts back online. If Danar sees they'reoperating, he may try to use them. Soon as he does, we have him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set the arc at six point three. I'll optimise the plasma flow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: See if you can access the circuits that have been affected bythe nodes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have enough for twelve bars of latinum. I'd be glad to returnthem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who says I'm looking for anybody? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, at least the waiting's over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have apparentlyintersected with something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, these things happen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would explain these costumes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's already killed thousands. It will undoubtedly continue tokill unless we stop it. I don't want those deaths on my conscience. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Repeat, Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're getting harder and harder to bluff, Data. You've learnedthis game very well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well there ought to be. Computer, discontinue programme anderase. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then they can't communicate with their man either. They won't beable to beam anyone through the field. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where did you get it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we are in the war zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How'd this happen? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. D <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get them out of there, O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Suppose we turn their impatience and greed against them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Infamy? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need some spreading around money, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our values require us to face that possibility. What of you,with your empire gone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alright, I was probably a little younger than he is. It's justthat, for all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father andhe almost kills himself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We spent some time together. Not very well. How well did youknow her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me explain what'll happen to you if you don't tell me aboutthe Vulcan ship. Your right of passagethrough this sector will be revoked and more than that, I will be veryunhappy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you need help? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It'll be dark there in thirty minutes. We've scheduled an awayteam for dawn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At ease, Lieutenant! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kelso, can you get them off? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You will follow Starfleet uniform code aboard this ship, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They appear to be in pretty good condition. According to oursensors their shields back to full strength. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And less enjoyable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's been going on for over twenty years. Doesn't look like it'sgoing to end any time soon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That was my first thought, but the Vulcans have no record of anystolen weapons or stolen parts, for that matter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deck fifteen, a few decks below the shuttlebay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the source? Something underground? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You may not thank me once you see how much work it entails. Assemble a team, and take a look at the records on the Drema quadrant. There's a mystery here. We've got to solve it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doesn't it taste good? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where did it come from? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you get any playback at all? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've decided not to pursue that commission at this time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We found this type two phaser in yourshuttlecraft. It was taken from the weapons locker on the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cancel inquiry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain T'Jon doesn't sound like he cares one way or the other. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'll check them tomorrow. I'm going to bed early. Theperformance is tomorrow night. I want to be up for it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll take that risk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? There is. Deck Twelve. The gymnasium. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is our e. t. a. at Pacifica, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Scott, Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. And Captain, <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You just have to know how to talk to him. Orton, I think we needto discuss the situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very good. At this rate we'll be able to bring the next wave ofcolonists in in about six months. I've to tell you I envy you. This isa beautiful place to put down roots. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf will help you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, any other ships in the vicinity of Dulisian Four? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've all been here before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want the Captain out of there now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many more Datas are there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course for the Romulan ship. Let's put up shields andgo to Red Alert. I want to be ready for anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vega-Omicron. It'll take months at high warp just to get there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Dokachin, the information I need involves a matter ofmajor importance to the Federation. I'll need access to your logs, yourfiles. My people can do the work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That doesn't give us much time, and it could get pretty rough inthere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, Counsellor Troi has recommended the examinations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's that important? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nor do I, but I know that this silence will injure us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And there is nothing you <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders. And I will do exactly that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Course set by whom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wonder why they don't react to us, or why the Enterprisedidn't read any life signs, especially with this many of them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir, I'm all right. What aboutRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, let's get to the surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not much power there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tactical analysis, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And we were going to meet on Risa, six weeks later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage, Mister Crusher. First officer's log, stardate 42761.3. We have notbeen able to determine why, or how, Captain Picard left the Enterprise. We can't even be certain he is in the missing shuttle, although that isthe assumption on which we areproceeding. For the last six hours, we have been searching withoutsuccess. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energize. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Amanda. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? Fire. And now, the conclusion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Run a diagnostic immediately. Try bypassingthe <eos> <bos> RIKER: All science labs standing by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So we can beam through a higher distortion field. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see if we can establish a new upper limit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not going to try to save her yourself, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. TheAssistant Chief Engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips fromcommand. All engines are offline. Wesley has hooked some kind oftractor beam to ship's power and he has it aimed at the door. We can'tget past to get at the computer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here. Let me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nevertheless, Chief Delegate, you're on notice that all of yourweapons, no matter what their basic function, are being confiscated. Violence will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's exactly the point.
