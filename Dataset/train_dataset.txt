<bos> PICARD: Goodbye, Captain Okona. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, let's raise our voice a little. Fire phasers. Justa warning shot. Mister Data, invite them to stand to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Distress signal? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aldebaran whiskey. Who do you think gave it to Guinan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand your desperation. The shock of learning you weredying. But you had no right to do what you have done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The priority is to find out who or what is doing this. NumberOne, the Bridge, such as it is, is yours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An extremely large storm system overthe Caldos colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long until they begin to coalesce? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Are we within sensor range of thenebula? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, what are you doing out here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have the information you requested. Colonel Stephen Richeywas the commanding officer of the explorer ship Charybdis <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we navigate around these fragments? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Target their weapons array only. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, I imagine a very similar discussion taking place onour neighbour ship over a thousand years ago. Let's hope our decisionsare more successful than theirs were. Mister La Forge, I want you toreturn to Engineering and continue with your efforts without delay. Mister Worf, prepare the phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are we losing our professional detachment, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, maybe now would be a good time to start. Follow me,gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask forhelp? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that's true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: About Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it would be prudent to find out if he'd acquired anyenemies there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold on! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is quite unnecessary, Doctor. I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Come in, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what are you here to do? Ask for a refund? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we will have it again, Number One. I have been studying theIconians since I was a cadet. I have to be the one to go. TheEnterprise is yours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, we need to find that source if we are to defeat thiswoman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? What are you afraid of? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kamala. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can that be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Alone, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a StarfleetCaptain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't ita little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain'sjudgment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, here's to the class of 'twenty seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you found anything yet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you believe he might have gone there to see Pardek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From South America. This is Madeline, my secretary, and I wantyou to meet Rex. You know, I don't think I ever heard your last name? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling, Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Mister Worf. Have your ship lock on to your peopleand beam them out of there before something happens. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! That was very foolish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume this is not a time to confront him about what happenedto his ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened after the welcoming ceremony? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rene already told me. Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I wouldprefer to make the initial contact myself. I'm sure you would, if thesituation were reversed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, orthat you're insane. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Whalen's life. You must help us to save him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well then my First Officer <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. How's that Cardassian virus, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless you have any other options, yes, I think that's best. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How will you proceed when you're there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Neverthe less, this is an option we cannot neglect. We'llcontinue on other fronts as they present themselves. For now, let's seewhat she has to say. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about males? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Concur. Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think so, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have a theory as to the cause? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I don't believe that the location of the crash andthe proximity of the creature is a coincidence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you smell a change? What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is my Executive Officer,Commander William Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. It was thoughtful of you to inviteLwaxana Troi to be part of the Betazed delegation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were married to my best friend. At first I thought it washarmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. Well, my mates and I were at the BonestellRecreation Facility, which was something of a dead rough crossroads atthe time, filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff. When atrio of Nausicaans came in, they were clearly spoiling for aconfrontation with a group of fresh-faced Starfleet officers such asourselves. Well, everyone in the group had the good sense to give theseNausicaans a wide berth, to stand off. Everyone, that is, except me. Istood toe to toe with the worst of the three, and I toldhim whatI thought of him, his pals, his planet, and I possibly made somepassing reference to his questionable parentage. And the next thing Iknew, all three of them were on me and I was fighting for my life. Iwas actually doing quite well for a while, too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Readings, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am less than an hour away from a battle simulation, and Ihave to hand-hold an android. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. The three of you will remain as needed to assistDoctor Crusher. RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, the person in question is in his quarters at the moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myselfwith the surroundings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long have you been on Caldos? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We never did, Lieutenant. Q suspended time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Whydoesn't he do something? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't that what I ordered? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the first thing you've said I do understand. I'll see whatI can do. And, please, stay off the comm. panels. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To what end? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But, Command? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Frightening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's get the hell out of here. Warp eight. Now, MisterCrusher. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe I have the best part of that bargain, Ambassador. Peace and long life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints andspecifications, but this will be my first time aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin the pass. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Elaborate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand your sacrifice, Captain. Unfortunately, if ourfriend out there has its way, no one will ever know what you tried todo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not require one, Tomalak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know where we can find Orta? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative, Number One. They're just reacting to our closepursuit. Fall back a bit but stay with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you input that new code? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I met the new head of Stellar Sciences last night. LieutenantCommander Daren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Voval! I thought you were dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course away from the Romulan vessel. Engage atwarp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us totalk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, this is a serious responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It means to spy, to sneak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, download the inventory and cross-reference it withthe medical computer. Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealttransported up. Captain's log, supplemental. Although it's beenfourteen hours since we arrived at'audet Nine. Hester Dealt has still not completed inspection of thecontainment unit. A transfer will not be permitted until he's assuredof zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas fromthe Rachelis System continue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have a business proposition to discuss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set course for Station Nigala Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they receiving us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Power to do what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there had to be some reason. In some way, you weredifferent from the other colonists. Yourgeographical location, your philosophical beliefs, the colour of youreyes. In some way you were set apart from them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn'tsomething that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go forgood. It's not something I'm not prepared to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you say that she's just trying to do her job? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your experience on board the Pagh will prove invaluable duringthe commander's tour. Be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusualorders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You now request permission to beam down to the planet. Permission granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this. And you should know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them toexecute your son. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any commissioned rank? Even ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a very human perspective, Will. For a Klingon in Worf's position, his life is over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I want you to sever your connection to your mother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised of your progress. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're all right. We're going to keep on climbing. Just don'tlook down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you would not betalking to me now. Obviously, I wanted something else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, are you ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet. Inform him of our projected time of arrival. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is the differences that have made us strong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, report to the main Bridge immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish you well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You would be so despicable? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why does it have to be me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose you have. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can any of you suggest any other suspects? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Headache. Headache. Surely you know what a headache is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because it's been given a name by a member of my crew doesn'tmean it's not a Borg. Because it's young doesn't mean that it'sinnocent. It is what it is, and in spite of efforts to turn it intosome kind of pet I will not alter my plans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's your other option? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Move to within five kilometres. Mister La Forge, prepareto extend <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to reverse engines. Full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I want you to flood them with anestazine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Found something? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? Oh, yes. Alright. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How bad is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Steady as she goes <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't see anything. Magnify section two eight five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. And put out a hazard advisory to Starfleet. Ensign,set a course to Evadne Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please come to my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he's no longer there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is Picard. This is the Captain. Can anyone hearme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will this creature be able to survive on its own without theparent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you must have the capability of affecting memory. Can youerase the short-term memory of everyone on this ship, remove allknowledge of this event, allow us to proceed as if it had neverhappened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We were once as you are now. To study you is to understandourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, escort Ishara to the transporter room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They are not vermin. They are citizens of the Federation. Iwill not permit this outrage! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what do you think? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm a little dizzy, Number One, but none the worse. I'm onmy way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data to the Bridge, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not surprised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, perhaps you're right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's only four. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maman? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commanding Officer USSEnterprise, stardate 46358.1. You are hereby requested and required torelinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, CommandingOfficer Cairo as of this date. Signed, Vice-Admiral AlynnaNechayev, Starfleet Command. Computer, transfer all command codes toCaptain Edward Jellico. Voice authorisation, Picard delta five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We question whether this court is abiding by its own trialinstructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat therecord? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Felicitations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elementsof its own culture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which is not surprising, considering how closely theirevolution parallels Vulcan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy at the moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there are no more questions, you're all dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A lot. Even in orbital space it'll get below minus two hundreddegrees. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see your point. My apologies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Steady. Analysis of the nebula cloud, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The fact is, I wasn't expecting this setting. I had assumedthat my senior Bridge officers would be attending. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what if you begin to change? What if you feelcompelled to go down to the planet like the others? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which you asked the computer to provide. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Suffice it to say, he's an expert. Commander, isyour contention that Lieutenant Commander Data is not asentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reservedfor all life forms within this Federation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Ensign, lay in a course to Starbase one two nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had hoped you would not throw away a promising career. Iunderstand your loss, We all admired K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will appearon your record. Dismissed. Mister Worf, isn't it time for the truthabout your father's innocence to be told? After all, you only acceptedthis dishonour to protect the name of Duras and hold the Empiretogether. Now that he has died in disgrace, what is gained by furthersilence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Doctor. We'll contact you again once we've finishedstudying the mission specs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He wants to do something nice for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait! Hold your fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was here to protect the peace. A peace that I firmly believeis in the interests of both our peoples. If I had attempted to boardthat ship I am quite certain that you and I would not be having thispleasant conversation, and that ships on both sides would now be armingfor war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're talking about slavery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When did they leave? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have they been delayed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you Masaka? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that might overload the field diverters protecting our keysystems. How long until the new ones are in place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll take that as a yes. You're with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will reconvene on the Enterprise, wherein <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting tocommunicate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There doesn't seem to be a way around. We'll have to rappelfrom here. This is sheer granite. We'll have to use fusing pitons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Close the channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your personal affairs are strictly your ownconcern until they interfere with the operation of this ship. You havenow crossed that line. As your Captain, I want to know exactly what isgoing on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I mustremember not to let this happen again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide. Weboth want peace in the Demilitarised Zone. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you determine what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. Captain's log, supplemental. Our away team hasbeamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is asaggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth hundreds of yearsago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier, larger and strongerthan the male. An arrangement considered most sensible and natural. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q the liar. Q the misanthrope. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not by choice? Are you somehow being controlled by that force? Did Geordi miss something when he examined you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor Quaice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then get unstuck and continue with the briefing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, then. There's still that anomalous class-M planet we weregoing to investigate. Ensign, replot a course to take us back to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No, let's help all of us. Generalquarters. Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Now look down the sides of the lift. Can you see two bigclamps? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five yearsago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, is that the forward limit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's typical of theta-band emissions. You have to compressthe detection band width in order to determine the fix. The sourceemission is five hundred metres east of here. And seven hundred metresbelow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Were you with Worf's father just before the attack on Khitomer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle. It's fourbillion years old. A computerprogramme from a highly advanced civilisation, and it's hidden in thevery fabric of life itself. Whatever information this programmecontains could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the mostdangerous. And the Professor knew that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: While you're at it, run a localised subspace scan to look foranything unusual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Check it again, Mister Data, and check every Ventaxian legalprecedent for the last one thousand years. We'll talk again in themorning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Well, what is it, Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's their condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Signal the Romulan ship that the last groupis on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. Mister Worf, what is my rank and position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have forty eight hours, because at forty eight plus six wehave an appointment at Pelleus Five we must keep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador,with great respect for all that you've achieved on behalf of theFederation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be toleratedany more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Allow me to introduce my staff. First Officer William Riker,Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, Chief of Security, Natasha Yar. Well, what can we do for you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless that was the mistake. Staying too long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me what you suspect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you will never know just how much Iowe you for that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was an errand of mercy. He was injured, Doctor Crusherdecided for humanitarian reasons to care for him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The risk is too great, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I felt that you would be needed here. Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kevin and Rishon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason forhis actions. You do, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna! Anna! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep at it, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Five to beam up. Energise. First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I amreturning the conn to Captain Picard as we begin loading the vaccinesupply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal mission complete. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting that we're in some kind of laboratory? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like to take a closer look at those readings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're on our way, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Very good. Fine. I'll listen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are they in working condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold your position until the Rutianmedics arrive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I certainly don't look it. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, what sort of jaded game ishe up to this time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's see what happens when it hits the shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inform me as soon as it is complete. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do they know of our Prime Directive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, explain control malfunction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign! Return fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full stop, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, the stakes are higher. But then, isn't that when the gamegets interesting, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You tell me. Are you strong enough to refuse to use that power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any word from Starfleet Command, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, are you familiar with Dytallix B? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. How do I do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Cor Caroli Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your mentors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A Captain does not reveal his personal feelings with his crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the point of creating this fantasy? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, listen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want any distractions. You, stay here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Thank you. First Officer's log, supplemental. I am sending ashuttlecraft to find Captain Picard, gambling that the Tamarians willsit tight rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Special operations on Celtris Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are. He'll probably have the same questions that I do. How did you get here? What ship did you come on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are four lights! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What comm. contact have we had with them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So these introns are causing her to re-combine in anearlier configuration? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then let's proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strongleaders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to go look for the shuttle myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, have you been ableto lock on to the away team? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not for one moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you expect us to do now? You have left us with a colonyof Boraalans who think they're still on their planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose you can give me any indication why this manwants you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall,Wesley, you took it very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Drop the force field. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We now commit the body of Ira Graves to the timeless depths ofspace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Three. I want you tohear what she and Brull have to say. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand back, Haro. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise responded, and found the warbird suffering froman apparent engine failure, and they attempted a power transfer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It sounds as though they may require the services of a doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship? The Ferengi ship that attacked me. Or is it about toattack me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And there is a bill to be settled at Mrs. Carmichael's boardinghouse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So why do you now live in huts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, all right. Have Commander LaForge transport a stasisunit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it tostore tissue samples. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what the reports said about Mendez and Hickman beforethey disappeared. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mine as well. Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. I am Jean Luc <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No reason you're aware of. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any particular reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Coalition. Alliance. It all sounds so reasonable, but whatyou've described is the behaviour of urban street thugs. We certainlywon't trade weapons for crewmen. How do you suggest we deal with them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. This is Captain Picard ofthe Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long do we have? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Data. Lock onto the beacon. Keep it dead astern. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Later, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lower the forcefield. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We both know that's not true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I wonder if you can possibly help me with something. I havebeen able to translate most of the writing on these two pieces For themost part, they're warnings of death and destruction to anyone whoopposes the resonator, but I am not able to determine what appears onthe anterior side. For example, this symbol represents the Vulcan godof war and this is the god of death, but if you look really carefully,you can see a third symbol missing. Now that obviously should belong tothe final piece. Now what's odd about this is that the gods of deathand war would typically always stand alone on an artefact. They wouldnever be combined with a third glyph. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lets use it. This ship must have a crew. They may still havetheir memories. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. We cannot allow them <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, take your station and keep her with you. This doesconcern her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're aware of the risks, Mister O'Brien? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You Recognise the old bag of tricks? What about this one? Come back, Ardra, if you can. No? Fine, allow me <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. Er, thank you. Look at that. Her right shoulder. That isthe same place that Data stabbed her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let me see. Your science project involved radishes, didit not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to speak with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's our course? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is Leah? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. No explosion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will be all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've been talking about it for days. Shore leave for thecrew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, andthis happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it canhave <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. Captain's log, stardate 46693.1. We have enteredthe Bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate theFederation outpost on the third planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Lutan, what do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Astrophysics Centre on Icor Nine is holding a symposium onrogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my place. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do doctors always say the obvious as though it's arevelation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought it would make you feel better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what's at stake? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you needed his help at the concert. Or is there possiblysome other logical explanation for what happened that night? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Crosis? How did you get that name? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rationalthese people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in thesupernatural. Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, tosend them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance andfear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused. NumberOne, tell me about this group's leader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to warp one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the Enterprise has been delayed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's reassemble in six hours. Stay sharp. No surprises. Iwould rather outthink them than outfight them. Questions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. I assume you know what it's about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the total? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you're continuing his work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaboratemeals either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trustme. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child buildingthose model starship engines. They were well worth it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Launch probe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Anaya, full about. Half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume you have control of the computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is alive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The danger is minimal, Number One. Chorgan is unlikely to doanything rash with the Enterprise's phasers trained on his ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Ensign. Mister Worf, launch the probe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Me, too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we have a problem, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi, your government expects us to deliver you to theconference on time, and that's what I intend to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, enough of this. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever your motives, you've already done enough to damagethese negotiations. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know why we have to do this every year. I thought thatlast year the teachers had agreed that they wouldn't do this anymore. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? What would never work? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And be Wesley Crusher's room mate? I will admit thatreturning to the Academy does have a certain appeal, but I've spent mylife looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like lookingbackward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try hailing it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a loneliness inherent in that whisper from thedarkness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Moriarty, my responsibility is this vessel and its crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what will that be  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long did it appear to you that we were frozen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Weapons report, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The rest of this is an issue, gentlemen, to be settled betweenyourselves. Now if you will excuse us, we have business. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am not Dixon Hill. I just look like Dixon Hill. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. We were just going to ask you the same thing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is hereby nullified. I don't want your help, your advice, yourfavours or for that matter, you. Do you understand? Once and for all! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's it. The way into our world. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can we do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's just that I don't like <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kill the lights in the medical lab, Mister La Forge. Let's seeif darkness will neutralise it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, take command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truthabout what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will wait for me in the corridor. Hisinsubordination is growing by leaps and bounds. I could use discipline,but I'd rather try and help him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He wasn't violent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want continuous subspace sweeps. We maybe able to detect a temporal disturbance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How's your search coming? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your friends. There was someone called Tom Norris? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it seems you have more knowledge of the situation than I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did I find her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I selfaware? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But until we assemble it, we will never know its purpose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Furthermore, pursuant to subsection D three, I name theGrisellas to arbitrate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's one of the reasons, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know that is impossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we were not unconscious for a full day. Everything onboard indicates that we were out for thirty seconds. The ship'schronometer, the computer, everything, Doctor, including CommanderData. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would argue that the Crystalline Entity has as much right tobe here as we do. Now, Commander Data has some theories on how we mightcommunicate. Please confer with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, then we have no other choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I met him once, many years ago, very briefly at his son'swedding. I can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant,standing in the presence of such history. I remember he spoke to me andI just stood there grinning like an idiot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise how unusual this must seem. My appearance is theresult of an accident, involving myself and three other crew members,the effects of which Doctor Crusher is currently working to remedy. Iassure you I am Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want them disrupting thisconference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It usually refers to the memories. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. We are very pleased with the operation of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when the Legarans beam on board? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, display interior security grid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, we're not gods. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may yet prevail. That's a conceit, but it's a healthy one. Iwonder if the Emperor Honorious, watching the Visigoths coming over theseventh hill, truly realised that the Roman Empire was about to fall. This is just another page in history, isn't it? Will this be the end ofour civilisation? Turn the page. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The word trust just isn't in your vocabulary, is it. Good try,nine out of ten for effort. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, that's true. Well, I can't waive them again. Onlycommissioned officers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, you are not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And one more full day for their answer to return. I'd like thetruth on this by then. I'd hate to have to prepare a formal defence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: God? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I have my orders. I'm sure you understand that. Now Doctor, this deflector wasn't set properly. It must be positionedso that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway, or it'suseless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been detected near oneof our border posts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These mercenaries use weapons that can activate theirtransporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly, justby firing at them. That's what they did to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What in heaven's name? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Well, now that's cleared up, let's, er, let's, er, let'sget acquainted, shall we? What do you think of your room? I know it's alittle sterile. But if there's anything you'd like? Pictures, perhaps,or games. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse course, Ensign, three hundred kph. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I care. Which is why I must see them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Quite. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's been tried. No response. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please don't look on it like that. We have done everythingwe can to explain these comas. We have performed physical examinations,and neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic,looking for viruses, parasites, infestations. We have investigatedevery possible cause we can imagine. We have found nothing. Nothing toexplain these comas. The only variable that we have not been able toeliminate is your presence here on this ship. Now, in the light of ouractions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They don't have to answer. They just have to listen. Sheliakvessel, you will have to get past me to get at the colony on Tau CygnaFive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would be a bit hard to explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you short out the power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Holodeck off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. How many ofyour men do you want to accompany you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's beautiful. A wonderful testimony to simpler times. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to get as much information as possible about thatanomaly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've acquired an interest over the years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A private consulting investigator, Data, who solves crimes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because of Data's wonderful after-dinner conversation. Hisanecdotes are the stuff of legends aboard this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And do you suspect that that is my intent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sit down, Counsellor. I want to talk to youabout a matter of protocol. I know there are no Starfleet regulationsabout a Captain becoming involved with a fellow officer, but <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Thank you very much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did she? Commander, could I have a word with you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where did youget this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not a crime, Worf. Nor can we infer his guilt becausehe didn't respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Nothing lies beneath. I'm really quite dull. I fallasleep each night with an old book in my hands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Astonishing to see it frozen like this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've had our problems with the Cardassians too, but now thatwe have a treaty, we're in a position to help. Your people have beenforced to resettle all over the quadrant. But now we can make alegitimate case with the Cardassians that this is not an isolatedproblem. We can work diplomatically on your behalf. But first, theseterrorist attacks must end. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which somehow resulted in complex strings of water moleculeswhich acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain likealcohol. Data, download this information to Medical immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starbase three four three. We're to take on medical suppliesfor the Alpha Leonis system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are other Bajorans in Starfleet. Assign one of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Capsule? People? What people? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Release him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I 'was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Clusterfor myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well take all the time you need. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Chief O'Brien, transport this group directly tocargo hold seven, and beam the remaining refugees from the planetdirectly to that hold. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. And Mister Data, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Timothy, can you tell us what happened toyour ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you care for some coffee, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have no choice but to try. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm re-routing the secondary deuteriumsupply. Switching to manual control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, the success of this mission would be far morelikely if we could get our memories back. Is there anything you can do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were inyour position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. Butyou're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. Iknow it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take theship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warpshell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may notsurvive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greaterpurpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you canpossibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about eachother, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only beentogether for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in thefleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking youfor a leap of faith, and to trust me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have a real look. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Temba? What does that mean? Fire? Does Temba mean fire? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you divert more power to thecontainment field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I think it does. It matters to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stop your descent. Prepare to disengage theinterface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How! How do I do it? How do I destroy everything? The controlroom, the probes, all of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attention, Ferengi starship. This is Captain Picard. It isobvious that we are in a situation here which needs resolving, and weare willing to do whatever is required, whatever is necessary. I wouldlike, I would request, that you present your terms to us. Captain's log, stardate 41386.5. It is with a heavyheart that I have offered to meet whatever reasonable andnecessary terms are demanded by the Ferengi. I fear for my people andmy vessel in the event the unknown Ferengi ask the unreasonable. Howcan I oppose even unreasonable demands? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently the Tamarians arrived atEl-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They have been transmitting asubspace signal towards Federation space ever since. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Korris and the other Klingon are dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. So how we respond to a game tells you more about us thanour real life, this tale told by an idiot? Interesting, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Premier Bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings, despite mybetter judgment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot find any evidence of a Will Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pull any personnel you can use. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you andSpock? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was not necessary to abduct us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want of me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat said that someone named Korgano isn't chasing Masakaanymore. And the old man said, he pursues her no longer. In a sense,this small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not good enough, damn it. Not good enough. I will not ask themto die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previouscivilisation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing, it will be adiscovery of extraordinary value. But it is a big if. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I saw you crying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could say I did. Increase magnification by ten. By onehundred. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's one possibility. Mister Worf, bring Ensign DeSeve to myReady room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. Return to your position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's added another chair to the negotiating table. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I missed it by less than a thousand metres, Enterprise. Adviseyour status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why must Sakkath help to contain your emotions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In good time, Duras. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the doors will open automatically when the launch begins. And I will override. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That can be arranged. Mister Worf, arm phaserbanks and photon torpedoes. If Lwaxana Troi is not in my arms in tenseconds, throw everything you've got at the Krayton. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then the only alternative would be a stalemate. Maybe acompromise might have been reached, a compromise that forced Data intothis silence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, did you hear what I said? All the twenty six men andwomen aboard that ship were dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's correct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine room just incase we need to move out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if I do find it, what then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there are customs and rituals of which I have no experienceat all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Dojhon. Doj hon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, wherever possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side,Commander. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have our passenger's accommodations met with theirapproval? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They wanted the best. That, according to all reports, is Riva. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes I would, and should. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you, sir? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing would be served by killing the Arbiter before hisdecision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paidmy respects. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explanation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The same thing. But when you moved back toward me it gotbetter. Well, it seems as if we're stuck with each other. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riva, if you are ready, the situation at Solais Five is verycritical. We should not delay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in thegalaxy. If I save this boy, I break that law. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you done with my ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I shall appoint you my executive officer in charge ofradishes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Recommendation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we have them securely, Lieutenant? Can they beam out to theplanet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdictionhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt atcommunication. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're talking about restoring the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your son? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If force is necessary, we will use it, but that will mean wehave failed. Our goal here is to establish some kind of relations withthe Romulans. If we don't succeed, then to convince them of ourresolve. The general feeling at Starfleet is that they are seeking aconfrontation. They may want to test themselves in battle against aFederation starship. See how far we have advanced. If that is the case,then I need to know it. Counsellor, I shall need a full profile onthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor, Mister La Forge.  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me talk to him. Number One, I think we have an opportunityto end this siege. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've never heard of anyone that didn't love a good mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I admit I probably would. And perhaps I should re-evaluatethat behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Preliminary to what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have underFarpoint, Groppler. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes, er, the rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my troupe arein rehearsals for a new production. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are we doing transporting Romulans on board the ship inthe middle of a battle? They don't have any weapons and that one looksinjured. If they were part of an invasion, then why are they unarmed? It doesn't make any sense. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm fine, Doctor. Lieutenant Yar, run a structural analysison the Stargazer for an impulse tow. Data, download all computers tothe Enterprise and file. I'm going to look at my old cabin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, scan for defences. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. The Yridians are information dealers. They mayhave been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send asignal before they were destroyed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My crew and I need a bit more informationbefore we make our recommendations to Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready for exactly what, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I shouldn't be taking this trip at all. I should be back onboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in fortyhours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A message? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impressions, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Compensation? You have stolen our children away from theirclassrooms, away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation? You claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed anact of utter barbarity! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've told you everything I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your moon has begun moving toward its perigee. We're preparedto make our attempt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get out of my chair. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, go with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've known one another for years. Tell me what you believe iswrong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She has been injured. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, it's my fault that you're here. I shouldn't have askedyou. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll keep you advised, Doctor. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, are you saying that you didn't want anybody to see whatyou were really feeling? What were you really feeling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, this is not simply a case of me taking theEnterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase to purge myself ofguilt and remorse. I will not let Galen's death to be in vain. Now, ifthat means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days,then so be it. I will take the full responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would appreciate you joining me on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gently. Don't sit up too quickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When did you first become aware of them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They haven't always, but now they do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the transport ship Denver has struck a gravitic mine left over from the Cardassian war. They've sustained heavy damage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But my things <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down andhave a closer look. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get rid of that damned twitch and put on the correct uniform. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the origin of the infection, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there,back on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, our options in a quarantine situation are extremelylimited. We are going to consider the possibilities. I suggest you dothe same. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel thatsomehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. Ithink he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to bethe cause of the destruction of humanity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I'd like to talk to you for a moment about my futureon the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you remove it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old. But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You value it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sounds perfect. Mister La Forge, how long before the baryonsweep begins on the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, thank you. In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. What do we do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Riker. it's good to see you have recovered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything would help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's not open for business yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By sanctioning their false beliefs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, how long have you been in command of this freighter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transport to the Romulan ship as soon as we're within range. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only one remaining is the one that needs no conversation. The only one we must avoid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's hear it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happening to me, Number One? I was preparing to beam outto somewhere. And I remember there was talk of an entity? But it allseems so vague. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't accept that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you found? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This way, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my experiences, mymental capacities are all intact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We didn't hear you. We come in peace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inertial dampeners are offline. Life support is failing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, you're not going to die at my hands or anyone else's. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Changing course. Heading zero seven three, mark two eighteight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lower shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it emitting any signals, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're mad. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To each his own, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result ofbeing held captive by the Borg, be my guest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, this situation is more serious than you realise. Inless than five hours, those two planets will collide and a new starwill form. Unless we move to a safe distance, this vessel will bedestroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he still alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. Request emergency power toinitiate lab quarantine seal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon, fait bon,fait bon. Ensign, where are we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we know each other? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of traders? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. I know. It has been hard on you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to end the suffering of one of my crewmembers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna. wait a minute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your computer had safety precautions. There is nothing youcould have touched that would have damaged your ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. That's better. Now, if we're to accomplish anything <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but I don't want to leave any avenue unexplored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you misunderstood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. Now, it mightnot have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The seabed it may be only partiallyfossilised. It could still contain organic material. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you like some tea? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impressions, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised theprisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you breakyour own rules. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do we know about this weapon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No harm done. It's going to take at least a couple of hours tocharge this cell. Then as soon as it's done, we should get it over tothe shuttle immediately. This cell casing is already beginning to breakdown. Anna, we are going to get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe my associate, Mister La Forge, may be bringing theanswer to that question. I request a recess. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. Mister Data, will you report to my Ready Room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I just got a message from Starfleet command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. Now I'm beginning to understand him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's your status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if we could reverse that process? Cause time movebackwards and then forwards. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll inform her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would be very happy to explain that to you, but for now Imust ask you and your men to leave immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's so, then there are opportunities awaiting you thatare beyond anything you have ever imagined. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? We just wentinto warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I'm really dead, then my only regret is dying and findingyou here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then my doppelganger caused no serious damage? The replica wasconvincing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say,you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What makes you think that extraterrestrials are related tothese discoveries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you find? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The last three nights I've, I've heard these voices. I'm on thebridge of my old ship. There's fire all around me. The klaxons, smoke. And then I give the order. And now the Stargazer is really here!. Andthat log. Am I going crazy? How do I know I was in my right mind atMaxia? How do I know I'm in my right mind now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One more thing, Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships were notcarrying scientific equipment, were they? A research station withinarm's reach of three Federation sectors? Cargo ships running with highenergy subspace fields that jam sensors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you make of this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in,used, cared for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Phaser. A sphere. Bok used it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you mind telling me what has happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In God's name, where did you learn to fight like this, man? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the matter of the unidentified subspace radio emissions,and the ionisationdisturbances? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Consequences? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is Doctor Pulaski? Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, will you bring Timothy to my Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just be gone. That'll do nicely. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Normally, I would be the first one to agree, but perhaps somethings best left in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you have only a vague intuition <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enlarge. What is their course? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor Leka has intercepted us before we reach her planet inorder to update us on the situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She might be able to persuade the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps later, Lwaxana. Mister Data and I were just about toshow Reittan Grax the er, the er, the new door mechanisms on the aftturbolifts. If you'll excuse us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor from thefuture who left behind a mysterious device known as the Tox Uthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counselor Troi understands him better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But why would a generator be affecting the Enterprise this way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship was controlled from the ground. Communication washandled through a subspace relay on board the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I may regret doing it, but I am not able <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q. End this. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, why did you do it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life form reading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, take us in as close as possible to the freighter's orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Less than five hours. Which is why I have called you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is what I want to do, but we have less than an hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deception? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More ambience. Less substance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was he trying to contact her telepathically? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was a man, taken for all in all. I shall not look upon his likeagain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With a cloaked satellite? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, time is the one thingwhich we do not have in abundance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened over there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You come in search of what humanity is! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There will be another day, Commander. Do not forget what hedoes here today. Do not let your children forget. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey. Hot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can you implement your tachyon detection gridwith twenty ships? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And congratulations. I understand that you were selected forthis internship out of hundreds of applicants. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not convinced of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doesn't sound too serious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know thatthe unknown is what brings us out here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay those orders, Mister Worf. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. lieutenant Yar, open channel. Enterprise toshuttlecraft. Mister Kurland, this is Captain Picard. Mister Kurland. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think so, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does this mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now everyone hold their position. No matter what. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire all weapons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The advantage is, thatit will appear from the Kreechta's perspective as thoughyou were destroyed in theexplosion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, do whatever is necessary to override theinterference. Let's complete our mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, launch four Class A probes toward the planets. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would be inappropriate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, will the injectors come back online? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Relay those coordinates to the transporter room. I'mbeaming down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay with Q. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, it does. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you still convinced he's me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a map. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Contact DS9. Find out what they know about this Yridian trader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you carry weapons? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room, stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I amgiving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you are aware of the procedureinvolving passengers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wishing for a thing does not make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome home, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am aware of that. But each of us, including Doctor Palmertook an oath that we would uphold the Prime Directive, if necessary,with our lives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, what do you do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We could station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoiddetection. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingonsurvivors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, you can't just resign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, shall we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need toknow it now. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My turn? No, I'm not much of a story teller. Besides, youwouldn't understand. Shaka. when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn'tmatter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancientone, from Earth. I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king. Gilgamesh, a king, at Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made themangry. They cried out aloud, send us a companion for our king. Spare usfrom his madness. Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city. They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgameshdefeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu atUruk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back to full stop, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Correct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Locarno has been expelled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's not dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed withour mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right inthinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange, that an obscure planet several hundred light yearsfrom here should be picked up by the probe. Data, did you take thisimage from the ship's library and programme the probe to send it backto us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Data. What are his limits? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's not rush it, shall we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the transport still under attack? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goodbye, Jono. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? Who are you? Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're sorry you came tonight? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter intoany <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see no need for it to be difficult at all. I understand yourconcerns. What I'm asking for is time, patience. If you have an openmind, I'm sure you will see that it is imperative that Data and Lal bekept together during the formative stages of her development. Afterthat, I have no doubt Commander Data will be delighted to deliver herto Starfleet Research. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Chief Engineer. I think I understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Conduct an intensive scan of the area. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm standing directly in front of the gate. To my left there isa small triangular screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Specify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of the aims of the exchange programme, Commander, is forall of us to learn tolerance. As for my crew, it may be healthy toshake up the status quo occasionally. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I suggest that youshould prepare for bed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helplesschild? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Donald, your transmission is breaking up. Mister Data, try andclean that up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare two class one probes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Turbolift Control, do you read? This is the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope for the sake of the project that I hope you're right,Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't own the Enterprise, I command her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, so far we have an isolated incident. If I can reachhim first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail. But if one of your ships decides to retaliate, there is a danger wecould lose control of the situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just the computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I respect my officers' judgements. I wish I could help further. If a way appears to me, I will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. But we've been on the outer rim for a while. We haven't hadmuch contact with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Check the hull integrity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When Gowron begins his attack, then we willmake our move. Excalibur will fall back with engine problems. You willtake the Akagi and the Hornet to this position, which will open a smallgap in our detection net. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what it says on my door. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Greetings from the United Federation of Planets. I am CaptainJean Luc Picard, of the Enterprise. This is Counsellor Troi. Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you seriously believe that the Federation will notimmediately intervene? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. This is the Enterprise. Captain Jean Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just as at one time you did not know how to weave cloth, how tomake a bow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Complete waste of time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. He's been reported on Romulus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain La Forge has disappeared along with the rest of hercrew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted toinform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-calledwormhole. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hiccup? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, hail the Romulan vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but it would've been a more fitting legacy if the messagehad not fallen on such deaf ears. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have manipulated the circumstances with the skill of aRomulan. My decision will be announced at high sun tomorrow. Excellenttea. Good day, ladies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is a life form and it has intelligence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And in the meantime, I would like to invite you all to join usthis evening on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any problems? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, no. It was Ensign Ro's idea but I fully endorsed it. I suspected that something like this might occur. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter, prepare to beam Commander Riker aboard the Pagh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I advise you to listen closely for I will not say this again. Icame to Risa for a holiday, nothing more. I have no knowledge of thiswoman of whom you speak, nor have I laid eyes on any disc. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Director, we will comply with your request to remove the colonyfrom Tau Cygna Five, but we need time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All dead? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, after we've passed through thewave, I want you to take us at a relative position twenty threekilometres in front of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's keep in mind that that particular danger was invented byQ. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Divert all power to shields! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prevent it from sending or receivingtransmissions of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're killing him. He won't survive another session. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Her society is aware that there is interstellar life? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you estimate the number of jumps it will take? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your analysis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent, La Forge. Now let's, er, let's throw them off guard. Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when you grow to like it too much? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The same conditions won't permit a shuttleto land safely, Mister LaForge. Any suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are the survey preparations coming along? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And her vital signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course, Number One. Just a little preoccupied. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In revenge, there never is. Let the dead rest. And the pastremain the past. Enterprise, lock on. Beam me home, Riker. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. Any reply? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: O brave new world, that has such people in it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On this latest incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You understand the difficult position in which I'm placed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander MacDuff, have the other officers listed here reportto the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's only. There's just one thing I don't understand. You weresuch a rotten swimmer, Louis. Thinking of you working on the oceanfloor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two Federation outposts in sector threezero have been destroyed. There's been no communication with Federationstarbases in sector three one since stardate 41903.2. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's very impressive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Will you come along? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's possible, of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Enough. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what can you tell us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you recommending? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it's possible. Communication, understanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge will be entirely at your disposal,Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means check the trace log. But even if the results arenegative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're right about this, how did it happen? How did we getthere? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may have to, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face himalone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? You're not attending the dinner with the rest of usthis evening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyoneon board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think this Ronin could be exerting some sort ofinfluence over her? That it's because of him that she's staying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As payment in full for your debt to me, you will guarantee hersafety. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I already have a hell of a first officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, this Maquis situation has you worried. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Prepare a tractor beam. Mister La Forge, I'm goingto assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're coming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room One, lock on to Professor Galen and transporthim directly to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've established the presence of whatappears to be an alien entity on board. It seems the entity hasmanifesteditself in the form of a twelve year old human girl who has been seenwith Clara Sutter. She has blonde hair, blue eyes <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, isn't it just a matter of time? I know how difficultit was for you being away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're prepared to transfer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sophistry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell him what happened, Narik. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still no visual contact. That's impossible. Mister Worf, same magnification fifty degrees starboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get me the Sheliak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell. He must be quite a man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Daren. About these thermal deflectors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to leave Commander Riker to assist in your searchfor Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Determine the absolute minimum field energy Doctor Crusherneeds and use the rest to get me onto my Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And as I watched Worf, it was like lookingat a man that I had never known. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's all right, Madeline, I'll take it in here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get me a full report from Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get off my bridge! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Senior Design Engineer of the Theoretical Propulsion Group. Doctor Leah Brahms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand that he requested the Enterprise specifically. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, until we know what'sgoing on I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened to them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't presume to speak for her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who's next? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I can muddle my way through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much asurprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would haveliked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. Youlook a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like tomake one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. Ifshe had, I would have been part of your life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your threats are meaningless now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before impact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will controlthe animal myself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But of course, as you and Lieutenant Riker have lived verydifferent lives for the past eight years, you are now very differentpeople. I suppose it's a little like meeting someone's twin. But nomatter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers onboard. And as Lieutenant Riker will be with us for several days, Ithink we should do everything we can to make him comfortable andwelcome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've heard more than enough. You're you again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why wasn't I notified? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shall we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you to maintain this course for another hourPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All I'm saying is that you removed something which clearly didnot belong to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then your friend is in trouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and you requiremedical attention. Lieutenant Worf, will you accompany SublieutenantSetal to the Sickbay. We will attend to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you need my help in this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mirasta Yale? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you are a member of this crew, and you will not gointo hiding whenever a Klingon ship uncloaks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have considered the possibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No he's not. He's er, he's from South America. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? What is your scientific basis for that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No, you won't. You're not a killer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I don't want to risk implicating them. Not until I havesolid evidence that something really is wrong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we beam an awayteam onto the science ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the United Federation ofPlanets. We do not intend transgression of <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of amutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading toa trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like areasonable course of action to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can try. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when the away team arrived early he must have been worriedthat Starfleet was becoming suspicious. He needed more time to finishhis work. Apgar said that each of the three versions. No doubt, he wasafraid that Commander Riker mightlearn the truth and cut off his support prematurely. DiscoveringCommander Riker with his wife didn't help matters. I submit that he decided to murder Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that may well be. But Wesley's one of our own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, old friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room Two lock on to the young woman inAmbassador Alkar's quarters. We may have to transport her out of there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It wasn't possible, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'llbe ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now,tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroyhumanity? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The minute they believe that we won't accept their compensationfor the children, they'll break off the discussion, they'll disappearbehind their shield, locking us out and the children in forever. That'swhy I've got to keep them talking. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have a good idea. We're ready to transport down to thesurface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced thepassage of time while you were stored in the computer memory. I canassure you, we had no idea that that would be the case. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll see you at the inquiry. Good to meet you, Mister Locarno. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I'll go update my itinerary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm taking this up with you, Will! The Judge Advocate thoughtyou were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Now, whatthe hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why isPressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying it's attack on Yar was not arbitrary but part ofsome tactic? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have been contacted by the factions on Solais. They want torenew negotiations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Boreth is only twelve days from here by shuttle. As of thismoment, Mister Worf, you are on leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher just called me with the results of the DNAcomparison. Ishara is Tasha's sister. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. And you caninform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? Idon't see that those would be any more effective. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, do your best. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is our mission to seek out life in all forms. We areprivileged to have been present at the emergence of a new species. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the shrieking noises that you made? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assign Commander La Forge to lead another away team to the digsite. I want to know why this happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're certain. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, this is a relief. I thought that perhaps Q had found <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, layin a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate astatic warp shell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I don't want to anthropomorphise anything. I seemsthat some creatures have the capacity to fill spaces you never knewwere empty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he cando it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's have more talk, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he injured? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you been able to determine why he's still unconscious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a rash decision, ill considered. It's not like Beverlyat all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze. To Apgar, this must have seemed as though CommanderRiker were confirming his worst fears. And I believe it was now that hedecided finally to kill him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't risk everything you've worked for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, sir. My first officer will be joining us shortly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's exactly what I needed. Well done, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I admit I must have mistaken their subspaceantenna for a weapons cluster. Unfortunately, I fired our main phasersand our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know who you are and what you've done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not as simple as that. He is surrounded by Mintakans. Ifhe dematerialises before their eyes, the impact <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Correction, Number One. Knowing the decision you face, I havepermitted you this gathering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not the point. It would be It would beinappropriate for you to carry out the procedure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Crusher. Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently so, Number One. Starfleet believes that theirpresence is an attempt at communication. Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar using them in combat withLutan's wife. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even with all these uncertainties, we've got to try. Takewhatever steps are necessary to send a message. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Locate the exact source of the tractor beam. Lock on phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know what a court martial would mean? Your career inStarfleet would be finished. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happened to your mind, Doctor? The search for knowledgeis always our primary mission. I'm sorry, I really am too busy for thiskind of nonsense. Do I have to call Security to force you to report tothe Sickbay? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need more speed than that, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will be the day. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, assign it a neutral target. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, scan analysis on main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get a signalthrough this strong a magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If asearch party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for thosemountains. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Counsellor. He's on his way. Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No time to explain, Number One. Continue the evacuation of theRomulan ship. You'll find LaForge in the Romulan engine room. Beam himdirectly to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in less thanfive minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication what caused this hallucination? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe if we put some distance between us, that might weaken it. Not that I'm growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When can you start? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Loquel, Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is theonly one who can do that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starbase Earhart. We came here right after graduation to awaitour first deep space assignments. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about you, Rishon? Is that how you feel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Steady. Now, reverse and stop! Phasers fire, torpedoes away! Fire. Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you wait outside? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not going to work, Nagilum. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I just see a different big picture, Admiral. It lookssomething like this. I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassianvirus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion Four. Nowwe have a common enemy, he says. The Bajoran terrorists. TheCardassians can't find them, but maybe the Federation can. I'mbeginning to see that our mission has, in fact, been to expose Orta sothat the Cardassians can move in and destroy him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My friendship with Marta is not something I regret. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have my word as a Starfleet officer that I will not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You saw what that thing was about to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you're not going to submit. We're going to fight this. Ichallenged the ruling. Captain Louvois will be compelled to hold ahearing. She may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but Isuspect that she still understands its spirit. We will put to rest thisquestion of your legal status once and for all. Now, I have been askedto represent you, but if there is some other officer with which youwould feel more happy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would not expect any. Judging from the severity ofbombardment, I doubt any Iconians survived. Well, Mister Data, let'ssee what sense we can make of this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That'll be all, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A beginning. But how we proceed is entirely up to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How about that, Data? He won't even let you talk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is ridiculous, Doctor. I have an away team down there, inless than friendly territory, and in addition I have an appointmentwith several Romulan battlecruisers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. There are one hundred and three members of thescience team on Ligos Seven. We should prepareshuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers ofcasualties. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you been treated well, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean the interphasic organisms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It'll be the first order of business tomorrow. At ten. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want to reiterate, if you have any doubtswhatsoever about this procedure, you don't have to go through with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If anything, even worse than we'd heard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll try, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evacuated? Was the condition that critical? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what you saw was some sort of a mouth on Troi's shoulder? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck to both of you. Bractor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tomalak, how is it possible you didn't know of the secondRomulan on Galorndon Core? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear me? Please respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should be seeing stars by now. Data, howfar have we come? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amanda? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nelvana Three, Admiral. No base, no weapons, no sign of anylife at all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. There is something else to keep in mind. We are deep inTalarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. I'm goingto agree to the meeting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your Honour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any hallucinations, nightmares? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a futile effort. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until what, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must convince me. If I had irrefutable evidence? But youdid not bring irrefutable evidence. You brought no evidence at all. Now, here, you are not the man you claimed to be. Admiral, yourcredibility is stretched beyond belief. A Romulan defector is almost acontradiction in terms. But Admiral Jarok crossing the lines? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'll think about it and let you know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea what it was? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no FarpointStation, if I'm right about this. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain on board theEnterprise until this investigation is complete. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You control the shields. O'BRIEN <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Stay awake. Come on. There's a lot of blood. What do I do next? Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I really don't think that will be necessary, Mister Worf. Risahas a reputation of being a most peaceful planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a worthy Federation competitors in the bidding, Leyorof the Caldonians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, get up. Get up. You must not kneel to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, when sensors indicate she's alone, beam her directly totransporter room one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is. Paul Manheim. Fifteen years ago he went off to workon experiments relating to non-linear time. It appears he may haveachieved some measure of success. Speed warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ginger tea with honey, eighty degrees Celsius. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the wish to stay alive. Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sneezing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was curious. I meant no harm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, you'll have to work overtime in order to catch up, but Ihave assured the Admiral that you are capable of that. Please don'tmake a liar out of me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, cluck, cluck, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. There's not an outpost in this area could defend itselfagainst a Klingon warship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seal off the compartment. Prepare to vent the air from <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A long time to be alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Didn't you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's our heading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only a few more metres. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To avenge their deaths. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to StarfleetAcademy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, keep with it, Doctor. Starfleet has very importantbusiness for us as soon as the away team returns. I don't fancy theidea of my crew being infected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it wasn't a dream. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that an order, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are here together to honour our friendand comrade, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Coming to terms with the loss of acolleague is perhaps the most difficult tasks we must face in the workwe have chosen to pursue. We will all find time to grieve for her inthe days that are ahead, but for now she has asked that we celebrateher life with this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm just a little more contemplative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you lock onto our signals. I want you to beam CounsellorTroi to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me hear it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Casualties? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I speak now as the Captain of the Enterprise and LieutenantWorf's commanding officer. You will not executea member of my crew, nor will I turn his brother over to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have sent down what we call an away team to make peacefulcontact here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, based on your analysis, whatis the current Romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships inthis sector? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, prepare to beam our guests and their cargo down toOrnara. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Options, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in thatarpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you predict any change in the near future? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behaviour would seem to suggestwe did not. Why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career ratherthan tell the truth? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Probes? The probes. Launch? I launch the probes? But why? What's good will that do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Orton. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It takes more. Open your mind to the past. Art, history,philosophy. And all this may mean something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Without an antigrav harness? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done. Mister Worf, will you escort the Ambassador to hisquarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Signal them at once. They could be unaware of the danger. Theymay need our help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibitedby the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We have rescued four crew members from your observation craft. Theyhave received medical attention. The are ready for transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. They've picked a fine officer for the taskforce, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, I commend your diligence. However, I'm concernedthat you're working yourself too hard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you may have him confined. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: About space. About the universe you are preparing to enter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My name isn't Mot. It's Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your support is appreciated, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come onboard. Would you care to meet us in the Observation Lounge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll handle this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley. WESLEY <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy beingexpended. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest.  HAGON <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When we get wherever we're going, Idon't want Mister Data beaming off the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's beginning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't we sit down? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Our orders were to find him, to bring him back to thecamps any way we could. Perhaps that is exactly what we should do. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. What about a shuttle? We could send it down through oneof these fissures. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was not my question, Number One. What caused themalfunctions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, you didn't, Data. You got it. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indicationsthat this condition is spreading. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe the rumours of a secret Romulan base in this sector aretrue. Picard to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are not God. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thrill? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What information do you want? I don't understand the question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do they want with the Enterprise? What's their purpose? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would be inappropriate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm Jean-LucPicard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something youwill need if you're going to stay on Rana Four. It's a matterreplicator. It has limited capabilities, but <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, I deeply regret that we have notbeen able to reach an agreement. But, and I must be blunt, I cannottake no for an answer. This planet will be handed over to theCardassian government in accordance with the terms of the borderagreement. I am very sorry, but you will have to leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin countdown. Mark. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are we ready, Commander La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm trying, but the needed ship will not be available for threeweeks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we'll be arriving at Starbase one three three in a fewhours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're saying they. It is a vessel of some sort. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Absolutely not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you looking for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. That will be your top priority. Very well,proceed. Bridge to Ten Forward. Now that we are moving the ship as yourequested, I would like to know the nature of the injuries to themembers of my crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was necessary. Do you know what thatis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You sure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Once this Maddox has got control of Data, anything couldhappen. I don't trust that man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must see Sarek. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's happening again. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, thenperhaps he could force Masaka to leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sometimes, Riker, the best way to win a fight is not to bethere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Director Mandl, we've heard of your remarkableachievements in terraforming. My crew would very much appreciatelooking around. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If huts are better, why did you once live in caves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I heard about the incident with Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With so little of even our galaxy explored, I find it at leastpossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain RikerPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Velocity dropping. Thermal shields at full power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn. Mister Data, are your sensors picking up anything? Youshould be detecting a disturbance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is very reminiscent of Dinasian. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, lock onto the scout ship. Take it in tow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring him in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister Worf. I want you to time the Doctor and methrough that first tunnel. And this time we're going to pick up thosefive seconds. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpretingthe symbols and images of your dreams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay hereuntil we find it, no matter how long it takes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they intentionally jamming our sensors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish tospeak with Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there is so much to gain and there is so little to lose bythe effort. The problem affects us all. It cannot be ignored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are we looking at? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In return for some pain you'd given other creature? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase power to forward shields. Hail them again, MisterWorf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate sensor sweeps. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against hislife. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here becauseyou're in danger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in theface. Ready, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if they're moving among humans, they must have taken onhuman form. But the question is, how do we know who we're looking for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Download the files to my Ready room. I'll study them there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should take a look at it, Number One. Stand by with an awayteam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. Data, the moment you decided to stopimitating other actors and create your own interpretation, you werealready one step closer to understanding humanity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Since the military took over hundreds of thousands more havedied. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or interfere in any way until I arrive. Picard out. Number One, have Security moving that way but tell them tokeep their distance. You have the Bridge. Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I come in? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened, Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's your assessment of our potential effectiveness? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You weren't under fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may proceedPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare the shuttle for immediate departure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, we will leave. It is not our policy to intervene inthe affairs of other cultures. But before I return the survivor to you,I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of what he has done tomerit a death sentence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And understanding that has brought you a step closer tounderstanding humanity. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirtyseven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as aStarfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've seen enough. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point is well taken, Mister Data. I'm sure that to theAntedeans, we are equally unattractive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. But what would the Breen be doing inside theBlack Cluster? The boy described a boarding party with helmets andphaser rifles. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher has requested to remain on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where were they standing? Data, you're moving about in a very,well, android way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course, warp six. Mister Worf, send a message bysubspace. Tell them to prepare for a rendezvous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if we lose the force field for any reason, we lose theship. Force fields can fail, and until <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There must be. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I have rejected your explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand your feelings, Number One. I share them. Butperhaps the fault lies in ourselves. We were so eager to accept her. Each of us, myself included, wanted to see something of Tasha in thiswoman. We saw more than what was there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we are not. We can cure many diseases and we can repairinjuries, we can even extend life. But for all our knowledge, all ouradvances, we are just as mortal as you are. We're just as powerless toprevent the inevitable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's so much here we could have learned. I really regretlosing that opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Corey, don't play him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, Doctor. Do you have a recommendation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But when you set foot on this ship again, I expect you toperform your duties like a Starfleet officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, what have you done? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were not off the cruiser. They were from the freighterBatris. The leader is Captain Korris. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's Earth. It's home. Do I need another reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cortan? Cortan Zweller? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They make serious accusations against you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Such as the politeness of saying please before abductingsomeone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the origin of this debris field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you take your position? Mister Crusher? Layin a course for the starbase on Otar Two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until I disappear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. You were five seconds slower thattime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you please note in the ship's log that thisaction is being taken over my explicit objections. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, fix coordinates onto that vessel. We'll justbeam the whole thing to a shuttlebay if we have to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Remmick, either get out of my way and keep quiet, or Iwill have you removed from the Bridge. Viewer on shuttle cockpit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It comes down to this. We're faced with an enemy who aredetermined to destroy us, and we have no hope of negotiating a peace. Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can tosurvive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. Welcome back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, but I would not act solely on the basis of herinstinct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the price of that opportunity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all. But we are on a purely scientific mission. You haveno reason to interfere with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do have some questions for you though. RIKER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes I have, Number One. Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How so, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long until we reach the Fleming? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock onto the away team, prepare tobeam them back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you heard of a woman named Kahlest? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick itup. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise C? She was lost at the battle of Narendra Three,defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said you had responsibilities. Whatexactly did you mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So there is a hope, but if you have an evacuation plan <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, reconfigure working thrusters to manual input. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've stopped the bleeding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll advise you further as soon as you reachyour destination, Number One. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May we arrange for your transport? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't believe you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a twenty-fourth century mysteryI have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. Thisis a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps weshould try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehowincorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen tome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Having Worf on board certainly has been. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't call me Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Probable impact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, my first and foremost consideration will be toensure the safety of this ship and its crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard aboard the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Please do us the honour of visiting our vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do you see me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good, since we admire what we've seen of your constructiontechniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbaseselsewhere also. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which requires I now ask you a very serious question. Since thetwo of you are closely related to each other. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm reallyanxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,but two of the Howard women. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much time will these adjustmentsrequire, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you shall have it. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please believe me, they're adamant. We are scheduled torendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will pick upReyga's body then. I'm sorry, there will be no autopsy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would have believed I didn't need children to complete mylife. Now I couldn't imagine life without them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region. See ifthere are any Cardassian ships nearby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions. We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Good to have you aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you addressing me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I leave town, the town leaves with me. I get the feelingyour friend doesn't like me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which was? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Robert and I, we. Perhaps it's time to change all that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have made a grave miscalculation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have been trying to make sense of this gobbledygook, but it'sbeyond me. The fact is, my android officer, Data, is being transferredcompulsorily to be made part of a highly dangerous, ill-conceivedexperiment, and I want it stopped. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's an old friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't make that assumption. The effect on the Yamato wasdevastating, but what if it was by accident, not by design. What I'mgoing to say may sound unscientific, but standing on this soil,breathing in this air, my instincts tell me that we may have got themwrong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Natural causes? What in nature could cause that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you seriously expect me to accept those terms? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's all? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's get back to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have admitted that. I am only asking for a littleflexibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I should have listened to her. She told me someone was tryingto kill her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we move the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you like to make a statement before we begin? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support thishypothesis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There must be a way to avoid this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is he afraid of? Damn you. Help me! Why did you leave theship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Always. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp eight. Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we'reabout to face a challenge. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The important things never will be. Anyone can be trained inthe mechanics of piloting a starship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's over, Sovak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, in addition to your rank, you are a particularlyvaluable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of ourfindings to both vessels and to the High Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, take them to level five. Disarm them. Hold themfor questioning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wake him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, this is the Captain. We have arrived. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Lieutenant. Shields up. No one is going toharm you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For these negotiations to succeed I must be a mediator, not anenforcer. You have the Bridge, Number One. Brull. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each ofthose instances <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're just keep getting deeper and deeper in, aren't we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, this could be some sort of embryo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's this? A map of the ruins? I thought that I was the onlyreason you came to Tagus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did you get here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep trying them. Communications are bound to be erratic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have refrained from launching a counter-attack in the hopethat this can be resolved this peacefully. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How's mynamesake holding up to all this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, if you have completed yourreview, you are needed in transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wanted to say goodbye properly this time. I shall alwayspicture you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. Will you escort him to the Bridge, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's the good news, what's the bad news? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchangebetween the Iyaaran people and the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me. If you step out of thatdoor, you will cease to exist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The reason is obvious, of course. What are the Ferengi up to? Stand by, Enterprise. Stand by for what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Miss Rogers. I'm delighted to have you aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaultingprisoners is hardly a fair trial. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. This could be created by volcanic activity. Lava flows. These walls are dry, Mister Crusher, do you have anymoisture reading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All remaining power to the defence systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When helost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediatelyto the beam down coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, Lal, the Admiral is concerned that you need moreguidance than your father can provide here on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating throughlanguage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't. You're right, Mister Tholl. Any of us may be theenemy. And there is no way to prove that we aren't. But until we setaside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope ofescape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And no apparent explanation for the energy loss? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Move it where? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he doesn't help us, we'll have to destroy the outpost andkill everyone on it. He's still a Starfleet officer. He won't want totake innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's your choice, Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have a better one? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We're in a very important conferenceright now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean, now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can preventthe deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,that all this is just a delusion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Madeline. Good to see you again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, I want Doctor Stubbs confined to his quartersuntil further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is the second time you have accused me of speaking withanother man's voice. It's true he will always be a part of me. Hisexperiences, his spirit. But I speak with my own voice, not his. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a pleasure to serve with you, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not nearly enough, I suppose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's get them off there. T'Jon, stand by to beam over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange? In what way? Non-human? Artificial? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, gentlemen, your theories on thissudden vulnerability of these systems. DATA <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Commander Riker's meeting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, you're sound of mind and body. If you are properlybriefed, you will still be able to fulfill your duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two minutes, Mister La Forge. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's his job. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Feels like that right now. Good. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you want to be the prey forever? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Promise me you will try and stay out of trouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were Amanda's parents executed by the Q Continuum? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is the Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien was the one who safely executed the return ofthe away team. He's the most qualified person on board to operate thetransporters under these circumstances. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your escort will with you shortly. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To seek and destroy a metagenic weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. In the past decade, Manheim has turned some vaguetheories into a practical application. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Expect a medical team to accompany me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, once it's installed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do we do? How do we stop it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prove to the court that I am sentient. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Soon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come in, Number One. Commander Shelby was just telling me ofyour concerns about her plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any professional reasons? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A pity you weren't a bit more inventive. If fewer things haddisappeared, we might never have suspected you. As it was, the onlystumbling block was your ship. Our sensors couldn't penetrate it. Butonce the door was opened, the computer was able to detect anddeactivate everything you'd stolen, including this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To many people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So their only choice was to transfer all the stored informationand shut down until after it passed. And then reactivate their systemand transfer the information back to this main computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, do you have lock on the away team? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're going to have to prove that you are who you say you are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Locate Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you sure that that's it, Number One, or are you beinginfluenced by personal feelings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should have notified the Federation authorities. To concealhim was a clear violation of our agreement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappynews. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or at least what fields you're not interested in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't believe Ardra is capable of transporting the Enterprisea light year away. Keep hailing them, Mister Data. Repeat on allfrequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, what do you think you're doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I', doing my best, although I'm finding some of the ritualsquite demanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The manifest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As beforePICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lantree, this is Picard of the Enterprise. What is thenature of your emergency? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he? Are you sure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Today, perhaps. But if there are others with the courage ofAdmiral Jarok, we may hope to see a day of peace when we can take hisletter home. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Number of casualties? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're relieved of duty, Commander. Mister Worf, confineMister Riker to his quarters. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship's computer <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to thehostile to blind it at the moment we separate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that the only reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An explosive device at the mission site. She died instantly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're certainly not an old lady. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Abort and destroy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is Miss Brianon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, escort her to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you localise the source of the gravitational field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot give you what you want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there's a possibility of getting more from him, I'd like youto pursue it. But we need to continue our investigation. We'll enterthe Black Cluster at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get to it, Tomalak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And who is this Ardra? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can give you books that will help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which had a terrestrial launch date ofJuly 23rd, 2037. It was the third manned attempt to travel beyond theconfines of the Earth's solar system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dispersal pattern, sierra. And fire! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp nine. Course, one five one mark three three zero. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted fromJameson isn't possible any more. And you wanted revenge. You blamedyour war on him, and there's no doubt he had a lot to do with it. Butyou had the weapons and you used them. You could have tried fornegotiations for peace on your planet long ago. Instead you chose tofight. How many of those forty years of civil war are on your head,Karnas? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can it be possible they know what they're doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much Iappreciate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, were you getting tired of my company? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet, will you join me on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I couldn't find your medical kit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have injuries? Can we assist you in any way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew,welcome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What were they trying to communicate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From your Starfleet records. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Decades ago, light years away, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up withsome explanation for your abduction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you do the modifications? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'Tal, this Council knows the law of heredity well. G'now jukHol pajhard. A son shall share in the honours or crimes of his father. Toral is Duras' son. That has been established by the genetic scan. Butwith due respect to the traditions and laws of this High Council, thereis no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who hasfought no battles, shed no blood for his people, or earned no honourfor himself. One day, perhaps he shall. But not now. Duras is dead. Hisclaim to the leadership died with him. Gowron shall lead the Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that will take some time to explain. Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forgehas managed to disable the alien transformationprogramme. Starfleet hasdispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The trouble is, he could be right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Computer identify musical composition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The support systems are being restored. We're continuingrepairs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughoutthe quadrant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. Ifwe're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot'sClaw. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A second artefact? Oh, by the way, that first artefacts is notRomulan. It's Vulcan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please. You were saying about the Cardassians? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: State of the art vessel? Data, signal Parliament we'll bedelayed. We will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm familiar with the practice of the feast before thetransfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made morepalatable choices. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could take you with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My ankle is broken. I will just slow you down when you need tomove quickly. Now, you are the leader. And that's an order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. Iasked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance toredeem yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're not involved in this decision, boy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Lieutenant, I cannot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Intense magnetic fields have a disruptiveeffect on electrical systems. Therefore we can expect communicationsinterruptions, as well as potential temporary loss of other systems. Asa precaution, we are now going to Yellow Alert. Stay sharp, everyone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was our pleasure, Mirok. And I hope that this example ofcooperation between our two peoples will not be an isolated incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's all of them except for the two on the Bridge. Waithere until I return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The geetas? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has arrived with Governor Torak. Pleasereport to the Observation lounge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will tell you again. Data is a valued member of my crew. Heis an outstanding Bridge officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds like animals. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I deliberately avoided speakingwith the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of ourplan. But now that I have, he seems to be a fully realised individual. He haseven accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do we reason with them? Let them know that we are not athreat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Klingon cruiser, this is Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. Nicely done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know where he is? Could he help us restore normal time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you sense something from any of us at that time? Anyunusual emotion? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. No doubt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It mightgive a clue to the cause of this drought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At the moment, it's you who are setting the tone. Thesophistication of this programming is remarkable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we're overdue for our computer refit. Number One, have youever considered whether Data is more human, or less human than we want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nobody's going in there until we have done a full sensoranalysis. I want to do everything possible to determine that it's safe,and when I am satisfied, then you, Data, and Commander La Forge willenter the wormholetomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Prime Directive forbids us to interfere with the socialorder of any planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, I need to see you on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we must agree to an arbiter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lower shields. Surrender, as ordered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seventeen degrees to port, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, check hull and shield integrity for any sign ofintruders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, transport Mister La Forge and the Romulandirectly to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, stop this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I could use your help with the infuser array. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, the leading scientist of Kaelon Two and <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we go to warp speed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We still have no idea what you represent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Be specific. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Origin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher is seriously hurt. We can't contact theEnterprise. The communicators are out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Again, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a lock on her signal once she's aboard. At the first sign of trouble I want to be able to bring her back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reaching up from the planet surface. Amazing power. Data, whatdoes the legend say about the end of the Tkon Empire? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, at the risk of being rude. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beamdown. Karnas, I asked Doctor Crusher to bring with her the visualrecords we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look atthem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has Worf found anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why don't you just take your ships across? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, we have no reason to rule out anything. We are notordered to investigate the origins of our guest, nor tell anyone whatthey should believe. We are simply to transport Kahless to the HomeWorld. And while he's here with us, he will be treated as an honouredguest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No longer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell Starfleet we're entering the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you must realise that something hashappened to you. The Data I know would never have agreed to be awilling party to Lore's plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which couldextract water from the air. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are its weapons systems active? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then find others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Proconsul says that he is prepared toendorse peace talks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long do we have shields based on current calculations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf and I detected the same scent when we bumpedinto your son at the Holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transportthe Boraalans? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's too close to be a coincidence. Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, it's a little more complicated than that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll see what I can do. And now, if you will excuse me, I'msure the two of you have a lot to talk about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well played, Counsellor. May I have a word with you for justa moment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Under whose command in this sector? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I convinced them I was a smuggler. Will, these are not commonthieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts from archeological sitesthroughout this sector. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, my God. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, I came to alert you that theRekags and the Seronians are in disagreement about the seatingarrangements at the conference table. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If someone were to challenge him, the rest of the crew wouldfollow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek, those people are Federation citizens and I am swornto protect them. If your troops attack that village, my security forceswill respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea what killed her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why are you safe?. Why is this house a sanctuary? Does it haveto do with you? With your refusal to fight? Tell me this. If Rishonwere in danger, would you kill to save her life? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We hope you find the room comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since acaptain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what Iproject. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, that's enough, Ensign. Come to full stop and holdthese coordinates. WESLEY <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Glad the Academy's still teaches the strategies of Sun Tzu. This delay had better prove out, LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, go to warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cup? Glass? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you fromtaking that action, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I shall busy making arrangements for the conference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can accommodate you, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: About what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, no. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander La Forge. What's our status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, where is the Devoras now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe that Chapter Four, Article Twelve of the Uniform Codeof Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioningbegins. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf's challenge is successful. The honour of his family mustbe restored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've done well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you honestly believe youhave sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek! I've come a long way to see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The important thing at the moment is that one of your ships maybe in jeopardy. Mister Worf, has there been any answer to ourcommunication? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm fully aware of your Starfleet record, your problems onother ships, and the incident on Garon Two that led to your courtmartial. And I'm concerned about your presence on this delicatemission. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had this feeling I had physically leftthe Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewherein the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute,to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You say that with remarkable assuredness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, you kept the name. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut that off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I mean now, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now,according to our customs, is called an act of war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a long range subspace Array. We use it for gathering dataon astronomical phenomena. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's that hum? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I should have beamed you up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unbelievable! You are out of your mind! The Sarthongians aremerciless to trespassers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister Worf. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if you go back, it could be a great deal more helpful. Thewar is going very badly for the Federation, far worse than is generallyknown. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within sixmonths we may have no choice but to surrender. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are entitled to consultation under paragraph six hundred andfifty three subparagraph nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The pain is going away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can understand them looking at a dying man's eyes, but thehowling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you requireany assistance, then the Enterprise is at your disposal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leave me alone, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q. It's about time you showed up. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to go again, only this time I'm going to dress thepart. Why not come with me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why was he assigned to the Lunar Five facility? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What else? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's so much I wanted to tell you. The Academy, there'ssomeone, someone who meant a great deal to me. He's been there forever. Someone you must get to know. His name is Boothby. Now, you tell himthat you and I were friends. Now, when I was there, he helped me. Listen to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative. I'll handle this myself. He was an expert incybernetics? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interestwhile I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. Do you think Iwish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see for myself the implications for theFederation? Good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! All of myinstincts, my training, my very being as a Starfleet officer are atodds with my responsibilities as Arbiter of the Klingon High Council. We walk the same tightrope between two worlds, you and I. We must tryour very best to keep those two worlds separate, or we shall certainlyfall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is my responsibility to protect the lives of Federationcitizens. I will not permit this abduction to succeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was it a resettlement of their choosing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment, Captain. We've also discovered a human among yourcrew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm really anxious to see the final artefact, because it mightprovide a valuable insight into Vulcan mythology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a thriving colony on that planet. Rather than uprootthese people, may I offer a compromise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are within their rights to demand the removal of thesetrespassers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A telepathic weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, there'll be a memorial service at twenty threehundred hours this evening. Mister Data is making arrangements. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes. Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure, butthat's what I'm going to put to the test. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time to asteroid field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless it's followed by? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I agree this is highly unlikely, but we have to proceedwith our current dilemma as though Q is powerless to prevent it, don'twe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's interesting that you should mention the Horatio. It's oneof the subjects I wanted to discuss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're the woman he was talking about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. You and Data beam down. Locate the power source ofthat shield. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans until you're ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,DaiMon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't accept that explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, you stay at your post. If this is the result ofa Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She was trying to help you.! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the others? Including the victim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But they'll benefit from the extended time. It will allow themto acclimate before returning to Earth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Additional units? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're ready anytime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what I thought you said. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assemble an away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold on, it won't be long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can tell him yourself, in person. Bringthat ship back at once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, post security guards at all emergency airlocks ondecks <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want security teams along the main passagewaysand in every transporterroom. And see if the computer would be good enough to give you theprecise stun setting to disable Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, this seems to be a situation more suited to yourtalents. I'll leave it with you. I'll be on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to findsome way to help him to make a positive contribution. Get to know theman better. Make him your best friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, Marcus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He also believes that you're a less than perfect Starfleetofficer. Will, I want you to play into that role. Baran and I, well, hedoesn't care very much for me, but he has to tolerate me because heneeds my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies,then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please report to the Bridge. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Civil. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Energise the network. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've already told you that twice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ficus sector. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a good chance that our competition may be here beforeus. Battle stations, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Change course to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You did what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You call this getting along? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight. And may your cloak bringyou all you deserve. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Addictive? What have you discovered? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the relays? Are you absolutely certain you don'tneed a new phase invertor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Firing impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think he will come? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by hisson. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill myson. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr will be preparing me for my role in therite of succession. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard station orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was not amused. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the scout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take a security team to holodeck three. DisconnectMister Barclay from the computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I put it to you all. I think we shall end up with a fine crew,if we avoid temptation. So, Number One, let's go to our next job. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A Federation starship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has no intention of stopping. He feels perfectly justifiedin using her until she dies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what the hell is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was almost hoping that you'd find a problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A single Data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity. Awonder, even. But thousands of Datas. Isn't that becoming a race? Andwon't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now, tell me, Commander,what is Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I'll see you in a few minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, where are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, make sure that your tricorder iskeeping a precise map of the route. We could very easily get lost inhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you determine how long they've been gone from theshuttlecraft? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If your intent is to intimidate, you are not succeeding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And those same waves have been randomly striking differentareas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generatorchanges. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us to warp seven point two one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Locate all Earth deep space launches from 2123 until 2190, witha destination in or near the Ficus sector. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, did you get my message? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Donald, we'll get our teams to work on it immediately. I'm sureneither of us feels too comfortable sitting around in the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Enterprise. Well, now that we're under way, I cantell you about our mission. Starfleet Intelligence believes theCardassians are developing a metagenic weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not going to hurt you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your published writings have been sporadic for the last decade. Your appearance at symposia has been rare, or scheduled and thencancelled at the last moment. The finest archaeologist of the centuryis now shrouded with a cloak of mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I think that you should consider analysing yournew guidance system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, please. I feel fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, report. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, but the battle was won. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what respect? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've both seen the message about the plague? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on, you've done this before. It's just like on a holodeck. One step at a time, just climbing steadily and slowly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering and programming. Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics ingeneral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not fire on defenceless people. Mister Worf open a channelto the Lysians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Crusher, all stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had this one Nausicaan down in this somewhat deviousjoint-lock when, unbeknownst to me, one of his chums drew his weaponand impaled me through the back. Curious sensation, actually. Not muchpain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal sticking throughmy chest. A certain giddy warmth. In fact I do actually remember that Ilaughed out loud. Well, it pierced my heart, of course. Well, if we'dnot been so near to a medical facility, I would surely have died. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can we try again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may never reach that point. A variation of what happened tothe Yamato might destroy us first. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long ago? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse angle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him,but I cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to actas the computer. I don't care how smart he is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A loose alliance formed in the early part of the twenty secondcentury. It was the first stirrings of worldgovernment. You should read more history, Number One. Computer, locateexact dates in which this signal beacon was in general use. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will discuss the matter with Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which control keys? Damn. Of course, you can't see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve themand their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but ina situation like this, we have to be cautious. What we do today mayprofoundly affect upon the future. If we could see every possibleoutcome <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My medical team suggests there may be alternative treatment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No ID, no answer to our signals. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's where I'll be. Number One. Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could he be some kind of android? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something more, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doesn't it seem strange to you that there have been two Borgattacks and the Enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Restart the engine, now! Pull up hard! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Thank you. Picard out. Our comm. badges must be locked intothe simulation. If that had been the real Commander Riker, he wouldhave given my location as holodeck three. Mister La Forge, will youexcuse us, please? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At Lashmir? Was it like this at Lashmir? A similar situation tothe one we're facing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A member of my crew was being held unjustly. I stand by mydecision. Mister Remmick, you have talked to every member of this ship. I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you'relooking for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe that one of you has a fragment from Indri Eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Korris, this is Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what about when there are no others, when you are alone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have no functional propulsion systems? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put them on screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring us about, Ensign. Maximum shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. It is urgent that you respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for anyreason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try andtake them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship cando. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximumacceleration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tholl, I asked her to open the door. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you've been planning this so long, youmust have a way of getting off the Enterprise and leaving this system. I think you have a ship coming for you. I plan to be on it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight atsomething he did not want to see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Miss Odell, you were the one who wanted a new home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Let's see if they've spotted us. Magnification, one hundred. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain's personal log, supplemental. I have justwitnessed the total destruction of the Enterprise with a loss ofall hands, save one. Me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, that is a fine argument, but it doesn't change myfeeling that the proper place for Lal to develop is by Data's side. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, butwe could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is Maques suggesting that your mother's metaconscious has beensomehow damaged? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going tobreach. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you see if those clamps are attached to long beams insidebig grooves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, why not go out and take a closer look. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering? Join La Forge down below in Engineering, NumberOne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge untilCommander Riker returns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we begin a power transfer, can we restore life supportsystems to that compartment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could your Visor device have malfunctioned? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shut it off. Mister La Forge, lay in a course on thosecoordinates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not as much as you'd imagine. Sarek and Spock. Well, sometimes,fathers and sons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, what is going on? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can determine what its needs are, we might find othersources to supply it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's launch a probe into it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't see any alternative, do you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, come on, it's been hours. You must be hungry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. What would you say if I told you that I believed that Iwas capable of being very much more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's your choice. If you wish, you can stay on the Enterprise. We will drop you at a starbase, then you can go where you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want anyone else going in alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lock in on this location. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's investigate both possibilities. Captain's log, stardate 44356.9. Sensor diagnosticshave been completed and indicate that all systems are normal. Thereremains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For how long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eluded the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, perhaps you should take Mister Data toEngineering. See if you can find the problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is your diversion, Number One, not mine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was somewhere else a few moments ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Either leave my Bridge or I will remove you by force. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My mind is barely working. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How far are we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, something's happened to me. I'mnot sure Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do youread me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seemed, Admiral, that they knew ourcourse, our destination, our plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's called the Blue Parrot Cafe, and you're buying. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: The ship will be ready to leave orbit soon, and I belong onboard. If I should ever doubt that again, I know where to come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, we will get out of here. It's not going to be easy, butwe need to work together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the FederationStarship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you have about equal physical strength and mental abilities? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to. Wesley. Wesley Crusher, come in! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, the answers will come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, why didn't you contact Starfleet? Let them knowwhat happened on board the station? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, do you remember what happened? You were abductedduring the mission to Tilonus Four. You were put into a psychiatrichospital. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you were going to show us something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's very kind. Qapla'! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you remember when I firstcame on board the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to perimeter teams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's my weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting quitecaught up in this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They look like cellular clusters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what would that be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's true, and he will stand for his crimes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Children are not allowed on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is Pardek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state, so wewill treat her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's gogreet our visitors. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much longer will it be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not now, Doctor. Please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The weapons conversion, Lieutenant Burke? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriouslycurtail the Maquis. We want to give them a target so threatening tothem that they'll be willing to commit as many ships and people aspossible in order to destroy it. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ultimate boundary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Will you advise Commander Riker Iwill meet with him in one hour. Picard out. The Admiral is taking theposition that Lal's development should be overseen by the mostexperienced personnel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's understandable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there nothing that will cure this infection? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's history fulfilling itself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our medical officer discovered evidence of injuries so severe,they might be considered torture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. This is their preferred way of space travel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't touch him! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in theDemilitarised Zone any more than your government would condone theparamilitary actions of Cardassian civilians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then find it. A ruling with such broad ranging implicationsmust be supported. Phillipa, I hope you will use the same zeal that youdid in the Stargazer court martial. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin your calculations, Mister Data. We'll go as soon asyou're ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let's hope they're in a mood to talk. Hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any indication of the source? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. I think thathe knows more about what we're really looking for than anyone else onthis ship. I want you to get close to him. Try and get his confidence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some of them, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Demons of Air and Darkness, indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not you, Data. Just her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scotsyourself. What was it that drew you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes the PrimeDirective very seriously. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, that bundle of wires, that's optical cabling. Seehow much of that you can pull out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, perhaps it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, may I see you in my Ready room? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any change in the anomaly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Taguans were to catch you down there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One thousand and fourteen, including your guest, Doctor Quaice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that they will not kill unless their survival is at stake? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use somesleep. Captain's log, supplemental. Starfleet Commandreports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone, and there is nosign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only memberof the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously it works very rapidly, but how does it work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Brekkians claim it belongs to them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have been looking over the glyphs and pictograms from theCalder Two artefact. And although I don't have enough data to translateall the inscriptions, the alphabet and symbology is much moreconsistent with early Vulcan than Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our sensor array is useless. We must find some other way oflocating him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The uniqueness of this presentation provoked this inadvertentbreach in protocol. No insult was intended. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim atrisk. I want every possible security measure taken to protect thatperson. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I pledge we will do everything possible to assist yourcontinued survival. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it working? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, are we progressing, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it could be nothing more than the result of a sleeplessnight. But let's be sure. Have Data and Geordi run a shipwidediagnostic, concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices,and we'll discuss the results tomorrow at seven hundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, Iexpect a better explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase to warp nine. How long, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Cardassians have destroyed the Bajoran ship, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In thirteen hours we'll be forced to eitherwithdraw from the border or fight the Romulan fleet. Neitheralternative is acceptable. We must expose their involvement before thedeadline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course for the Kallisko. Mister Riker, prepare anaway team. Captain's log, stardate 45125.7. An away team ledby Commander Riker has conducted a thorough survey of the alien shipKallisko, and has returned to the Enterprise to report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My name is Mot. I'm the barber. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One quarter impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh well, time to leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify, Mister Worf. Hardly an inviting planet, even for aresearch establishment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck ten. I've been thinking about thefirst time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned topilot me on an inspection tour, and I made some off hand remark aboutthe shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. And the nextmorning I found that he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusioninitiators. Well, I knew then that I wanted him with me on my nextcommand. Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? Iam betrayed by desires. I want to feel. I want to feel everything. ButI am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. We read you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A lot of questions, Number One. Damn fewanswers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're describing the situation on this ship. But CounsellorTroi reported nightmares. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, we understand that DaiMon Solok runs cargo there from timeto time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps he can help us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn'tknow what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take thismatter up with Gowron. I'm really sorry that we bothered you. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you rather endanger Deanna, a friend and a colleague,than tell me what is going on?! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let us do no such damned thing! What is this need of yours forcostumes, Q? Have you no identity of your own? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much longer before we reach them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid there are two more injuries in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask fortransport away from here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Curiouser and curiouser. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what is feeding the damn thing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sound again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, the shrieking noise you made. It causes them pain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel message. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what has the scientist been up to today? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My only regret is that it took us three years to find asuitable sun after you had first contacted us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister La Forge, are you ready to separate our guestfrom the hull? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, with your permission, I would like to take thisweapon back to the Enterprise to verify its origin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grandpa? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's no time, Number One. Initiate the transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Prepare your away team, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leave the trilithium here and take me with you. You can use meas a hostage instead of threatening <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularlygood subject. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for aCommander Riker Day next month. I'm even considering making an entrymyself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not cringing. I'm just acknowledging my limitations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue a full sensor sweep. I want all the information we cangather. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not pretend to fully understand thenuances of your world's law or culture, Lieutenant, but I do understandwhen somebody is trying to hide something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Valedictorian? Arms raised in victory? Were you so jealous? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we reactivate it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff arecarefully isolating you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It means they plan on keeping us here for a while. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in a standard search pattern. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind that wheneverwe have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's timeto cooperate with them. CONDUCTOR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, they will be detained by the Vulcan authorities for themoment. But they're also facing charges from the Klingons, theCardassians, the Ferengi, and at least seven other worlds. Idon't think we'll be hearing from them for a while. Number One, willyou set course for Starbase two twenty seven. I'll join you on theBridge shortly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What planet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have been fascinated looking into thehistory and traditions of your people, and I was very interested tolearn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led thegroup of Indians from Earth initially more than two hundred years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the second time that you have shown surprise at myappearance, Kevin. The first time was understandable, but now? Unlessit is because you never expected to see me again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a fast decision, which we must takeas positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly. to let you mediate the dispute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his lifesearching for the Tox Uthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explanation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are transporting you directly to thedetention cell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kallisko, change course. Take evasive action. Do whatever youcan to outrun it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've requested assistance as soon as Argh! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good morning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wake him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has something else happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I asked for Commander Riker's report, Acting Ensign Crusher. And since it now seems clear that you are unable to function within thelimits of that appointmentLAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will have the Captain contact then down on the planet andtell them to prepare for your return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Never? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then help him to see the reality of what may happen to hiscolony. If he makes the right decision, if he's as good a leader ashe's designed to be, then perhaps the others will follow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll present my compliments to the crew. Oh yes, Number One,about that Horga'hn you requested. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yet her neural activity is practically non-existent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your service honours us. This is my first officer, CommanderWilliam Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you doing in such a filthy uniform? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. A hearing, certainly. Probably a court martial. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The fight at Maxia. I destroyed an entire vessel. An entirecrew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, a great deal actually. My father was a strong believer inpassing on the traditions and history of the family. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter two, prepare to beam the occupant of the scout shipdirectly aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We sympathise with your situation. Surely there is a solutionwhich can be mutually satisfactory? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Source? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think we can stay here too long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I think she has a right to know that before she makes achoice about her future. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, andthat unity said something about them. That they had resolved certainsocial and political differences and they were now ready to become parta larger community. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. I accept. Captain's log, supplemental. K'mpec, who ruled theKlingon Empire longer than anyone in history, is dead. We await thearrival of Duras and Gowron, rivals for the leadership of the HighCouncil. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Send a security team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Readyphasers, load torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not a violent man? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what we'redealing with on Turkana Four. The last information describes a colonyin almost complete disarray. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as aheadache. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The shield that protected your world in one way is weakening itin another. It is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, you did more than your job. You enjoyed it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An impostor running my ship. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. Now, when they give way, we shall fall. So you'vegot to get your crew out of here before that happens. Now, there is aladder along the wall of the shaft. You can climb up that until youcome to an open doorway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know, just do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of our starships under your control? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a treaty between our peoples. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must be very bored, Q. Your imagination is running awaywith you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But do you understand the basis of all this nonsense betweenthem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I didn't give you enough credit. Continue thesimulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An android? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll catch up with you there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sir, our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to theplanet below. If you're still carrying the infection which destroyedyour world <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And prosper. Captain's log, stardate 45240.1. To cross theNeutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set acourse for the Klingon home world. After all we did for Gowron duringthe recent war, I am certain he will be happy to return a favour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, reinstate holodeck three programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's time for you return to the ship, Mister La Forge. MisterO'Brien, stand by to transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what is it you say? Take a deep breath. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that's a little premature. We hardly know anythingabout each other. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This would seem that this is Masaka'stemple. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroy it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, set course two five nine mark three one eight,half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting this is somehow contagious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save downthere is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or KhanSingh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked thatquestion ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this isnot a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's nothypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indispensable is the appropriate word. I think it should beonly you because you seem more able to control the effects of the timedistortion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No I decided to walk. I met Marie and Rene. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's no way round it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I said you're not doing this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we're causing it. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a few moments, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't have a brother. Two sisters, Anne and Melissa. Whatthe hell is this all about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Qapla! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then let her do it, and feel free to do yours. Ship's resourcesare your responsibility. I've always had absolute confidence in yourjudgment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A boy. At the same time we were facing destruction, this smallmiracle was taking place. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's come up with something that may give us a chance, if weagree to stay out of it. He proposes to turn total control of the shipover to the computer because it is capable of making quickeradjustments than any human being. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've just come from Sickbay. Doctor Crusher feels that yourmother's condition is worsening. Her neural foundations are gettingweaker. Have you had any luck here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father'ssin. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime wasto lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But youshould not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of thatlie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Everything. Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy froma former first officer of mine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's safe to say that you're his bestfriend. Is it possible to speculate about what's happening to him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Patched is good enough. Well done. Beamback immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then do so, and let the Bridge know that all is well down here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. We'll use the Jefferies tube. Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good, because our survival depends upon it. I am ordering younever to reveal what has happened here today. Not to Starfleet, not tomyself. You will conceal your knowledge of the Paxans for as long asyou exist. Do you fully understood, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, you never may become fully human, but you've had anexperience that transcends the human condition. You have been an entirecivilisation. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: No one is could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I neverthought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth Dynasty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need more time. Mister Data, prepare the colonists for anevacuation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If for any reason you would like to wait a few minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have one? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Screen off. Set course two two three mark three five seven. Full impulse power. Initiate Kumeh manoeuvre. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did you find it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, Mister Worf, come in. I particularly want my guest tomeet you. Admiral Satie. This is my Head of Security, Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Warbird, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Please, will you tell DaiMon Solok that we're interestedin transportation to Celtris Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lantree, this is the Enterprise. Captain Telaka, this is Picardof the Enterprise. Do you read me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the asteroid we destroyed. That was rich innitrium. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, the concert will ahead as scheduled. But it's a pity thatthe guest of honour will be absent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Imprisonment is an injury, regardless of how you justify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to CMO. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. In a moment. You were about to say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, Mister Data, I am aware of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain our present course and speed for now. I'm going tofind out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you pack them? What logical purpose do they serve? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please may I have your attention. Please may I have yourattention! Stop that immediately! Well, that's better. Now,what's your name, young man? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived momentsafter you left? That he insisted that I come here to look for you? ThatI find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? That's very good timing,don't you think? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can I do for you, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beam us directly to the Enterprise Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Satisfactory? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Sickbay would be a better idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is she all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll take the alien ship to the nearest Federation starbase. Ensign, lay in a course. Captain's log, stardate 45212.1. We have deliveredthe Ktarian vessel to Starbase eighty two and are now on a course torendezvous with the Starship Merrimack, which will transport WesleyCrusher back to Starfleet Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, this is very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll betaking on new personnel at Starbase one eighteen in a few weeks. Surelythe drills can wait until then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mrs. Carmichael. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has it been adrift for all those years, or has it has travelledthrough time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've failed to get through to you, haven't I? Despite all myefforts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay between the Ferengi and the Hathaway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Temarc! The river Temarc in winter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, please acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare to take us out of here, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Captain's log, stardate 47457.1. We have beentrapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Data andCommander La Forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage thecloak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? Who the hell is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Mister Worf, these are not jat'yIn. Our job is tofind out exactly what they are and then to determine how to deal withthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, let's begin this with a show of good faith. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure Counsellor Troi appreciates the opportunity to spendtime with her mother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were there any indications of reactor core problems while youwere on the station? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you will come with me right now. Do you understandme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We know about the transporter malfunction and that you areholding Ambassador T'Pel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were you expecting the Ferengi, Premier? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can't kill all of us. You need us to run the ship more thanwe need you to command it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across thegalaxy. Doesn't it make it natural to assume that the originaldesigners of the puzzle should want us to find it? Why else would theyhave put the pieces in our DNA? And in turn, doesn't suggest they wouldtry to make it easy for us to find those pieces, that there might besome pattern to their distribution? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's where they're going through. Send a signal to the fleet. All ships to fall back and rendezvous at Gamma Eridon. We'llre-establish the net there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we detect it before? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've no intention of performing for your amusement. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Drop to one quarter impulse, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see I have no choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Same question. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done longago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to stay here any longer. We'll leave a classfour probe behind to study the energyfield but the distress signal from Ligos Seven has top priority. Let meknow as soon as you have any further information, Doctor. Number One,you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has Mister Barclay done anything that could be consideredpotentially threatening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I have enough time to back to the ship and get my saddle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't believe you speak for the majority of the crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That energy cloud, Commander. I believe it important we haveanother look at it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just throw on any old thing. We're about toget our first look at the wormhole. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay with him, Counsellor. We're examining the Brittain forclues, but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Briam has supervised a reproduction of the ancient Temple ofAkadar on our holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief Investigator, welcome to theEnterprise. I'm Captain Picard. This is my First Officer, CommanderWilliam Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Comments. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, I have no wish to discuss issues of propertyor of territory, when our mutual problem remains. Like it or not, weare both trapped by this energy draining forcefield from the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As I understand it, Karnas, you were the one who demanded theweapons to avenge your father's death. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? Oh, yes, well these life forms feel such passionatehatred matters of custom, God concepts, even, strangely enough,economic systems <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We thought you were at risk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Expected duration? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exit! Computer, exit! Data, try the other exit in thehall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not surprised. Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Warnthe vessel to stay clear of the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember the same discussions between mother and father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. Governor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does it pose a danger to the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed, we do get an incomplete picture, which is why we alsodo surface reconnaissance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you calibrate their destination? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arkaria Base, this is Captain Picard. Deactivate the baryonsweep immediately! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate full check, all systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Help him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn it. I can't even make a log entry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At that speed, Mister La Forge, there won'tbe a ship left to reach the Pelloris Field. Do what you have to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'll go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is going on down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the line of duty. She was thefinest example of a Starfleet <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leaving school? No, you're not. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with theothers to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you thinkthat tells me about your character? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A prodigy? In what sense? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really areinterested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on CommanderHutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's going to take a little time to explain, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 46945.3. We successfullyevacuated the crew of the Romulan ship, and we're on course to theNeutral Zone to bring them home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's my job, young man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems we're alive only because we have been placed onprobation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If Deanna dies, and he breaks the link with her, then he willchoose someone else, possibly someone from his own delegation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vigo, is that you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf to my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ohniaka Three? There's no strategic value to that outpost. Werethey able to identify the attackers? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley! Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is one of those times when we must face the ramificationsof the Prime Directive and honour those lives which we cannot save. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about thoseroots. How did you know their medicinal values? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's welcome news. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leaving so soon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This child is supposed to bring them together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something else? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's try and find out. Computer, download all informationregarding signal beacon from Starbase mainframe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can persuade them to give back controlof the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging theFederation into a Klingon civil war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, we all went into this with the best intentions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will now return control of this vessel to the Bridge whereit belongs. At once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Absolutely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, Data. And I believe it is our job to out-con the conartist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That should make it about here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Simultaneously? All eighteen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're still your people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What would you have me tell them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs. Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Follow them in, Mister Crusher. Red Alert. Mister Worf, armphoton torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You also see things in a way we do not, but as they truly are. I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or any member of thisvessel be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't think of anyone who would have appreciated it more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was Commander La Forge able to provide you with the specialcargo handling provisions you requested? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm getting there. I'm going to have Engineering run a fullphysical on you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do we have any record of our current mission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm the Captain of the ship. What is it you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience amomentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I wantyou to take command immediately. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. Sounds, Smells. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not step outside the traditional role of the Arbiter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will your nervous system be able to handle that much sensoryinput? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is our highest law that we shall not interfere with othercultures. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And yet you claim that it is possible, that you're the daughterof Tasha Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Human? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Counsellor Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well it looks like we're going to be on Caldos for a few daysmore. This will be a good opportunity to get your grandmother's affairsin order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any way for us to duplicate <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand that you've relieved Doctor Russell of duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't see anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, have you been able to assess Commander Riker's condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Constitution class. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tallera, I've decided on a change of plan. Take one of theartefacts with you. Leave the other here. As soon as we have ourpayment in full, we'll complete the delivery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now there's a name we haven't heard for a while. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for Federation territory, warp two. Engage. MisterData, I want you to take charge of this investigation. Study computerlogs, sensor information everything. I refuse to believe that this wasa simple malfunction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Uh huh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, our Chief Engineer is checking the transport logsof the Potemkin. Perhaps that will shed some light on the matter. Don'tworry, we will get to the bottom of this. And in the meantime, you willbe taken to your quarters. Try and make yourself as comfortable aspossible. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've regained attitude control for the ship, but main power isstill offline. It looks as though the entire power transfer grid hasbeen destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't know, Robert. You don't know. They took everything Iwas. They used me to kill and to destroy, and I couldn't stop them. Ishould have been able to stop them! I tried. I tried so hard, but Iwasn't strong enough. I wasn't good enough. I should have been able tostop them. I should! I should! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll have to fill in, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nor can I change who I am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So this is affecting the entire crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't recall saying I was embarrassed. If's just that Iprefer to be acquainted with the women that I kiss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan, that was twenty three years ago. Tasha Yar was only achild. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean Luc Picard of the Enterprise. For whatreason have you locked your weapons on us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You echo another noteworthy commander in a similarcircumstances, Number One. A countryman of yours, George ArmstrongCuster when his Seventh Cavalry arrived at the Little Big Horn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. This is for your benefit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's possible. But if that is an archive from some ancientcivilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful. Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in anydanger, I want you to sever the connection immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. How long can you stay? There's so much to talkabout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, get them up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anyone in particular? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're changing course. Set coordinates for the First City ofthe Klingon Imperial Empire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't have an answer for that. A few hours ago, weencountered a warship. Possibly the one which attacked you. We forcedit to leave the system but we were unable to affect it otherwise. Itcould return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An old man. Masaka's father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think thatyou are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathyfor what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don'tthink that you can really be in love with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's perfectly normal among the Trill. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ardra somehow transported me here. Will youbeam me directly to my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Qab jIH nagil <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Wyatt Miller. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your Honour, I appreciate your indulgence. Allow me to explain. A team from the Enterprise has taken control of this woman's ship nowin orbit around Ventax Two. Thank you for your help, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Batai? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These are the science stations. From the command centre here,we have control of the science stations <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You had no reason to leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you remember that folk melody I playedfor you this morning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message toLutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have nowcommitted what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you havevisited our vessel, you most certainly know thepower of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion,Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Rabal? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring us within range of the fragment,Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, stop the transmission. That is an order. Doctor Marr,do you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, prepare to resume course to T'lli Beta. Mister Data,what velocity would put us back on schedule? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The question is, how are we going to deal with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As ready as I'll ever be, Number One. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, are all systems back online? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Improvise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it out! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wanted to ask, during the second arpeggio in the firstmovement, I noticed that you played an F minor chord instead of adiminished D. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I could give you safe passage to a transporter pad in one ofthe cargo bays. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hard about, full impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can get back there and destroy that site, it might put anend to their time travelling. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved. He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative. He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information aboutCardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very wellenhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector. Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back toCardassian space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then who will they follow? You? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this isFederation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these peopleare under my jurisdiction and I will protect them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Those devices are part of a system located down here. Anotherone is about to be released. Watch yourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, bring Doctor Stubbs to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it God? Now, it's very important you answersomething. How do you recognise what it is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he wasafraid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid, Data. Splendid. You're getting better and better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can you determine, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? Myown father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend thevineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we couldcome to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. Idon't want the same thing to happen to you and me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then beam Doctor Clark aboard by himself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good Lord, no. If I was, I wouldn't have this problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean you're not born reading minds? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Caused by? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But they do have an interest in driving the Federation and theEmpire apart. Our alliance is the only thing that has kept them incheck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Further contamination must be prevented. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm sure you'll see there's nothinghere to appeal to a young person. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're increasing to warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An elm tree with a circular bench? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But in forty years, they've never attacked a Federation target. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm glad to hear it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For what purpose? What <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Now perhaps you can tell me what was so importantthat it required depriving the Captain of his cup of Earl Grey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wanted to run tests on Kahless, you should have sent aKlingon ship for him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still on Mintaka Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how do you account for it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you and Voval working together? He's the only one who couldhave brought you the necklace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some other time, Q. Right now I have other matters to attendto. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We see it too, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My God. Phillipa Louvois. And back inuniform. It's been ten years, but seeing you again like this makes itseem like fifty. If we weren't around all these people, do you knowwhat I would like to do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we have their position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Speaking on behalf of men of Earth, which is indeed an awesomeresponsibility, I thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are many things about her species we can't easilyexplained. Yet it is very possible she is correct. A ship from the pasthas travelled through time. How can we know what effect those eventswill have on the present. Indeed, we shall never know for certain, ifGuinan is correct. But I have decided the consequences of thatpossibility are too grave to ignore. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did this happen to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's entirely my fault, Marie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Commander. Tactical analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In fact I authorise and support your idea, Riker. Please, feelfree to cooperate with him if you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What you neglected to mention was that following the loop yourteam attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash. Youtold the truth up to a point. But a lie of omission is still a lie. Doyou remember the day you first came aboard this ship? Your motherbrought you on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, we're all doing the best we can in a difficultsituation. Think nothing more of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's try turning up the volume. Increase the intensity, MisterData. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you must be my uncle Rene. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you'll agree it is enough to present to your leader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare for emergency transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we lost you in mid-transport. Where'veyou been? What is going on down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Clear. Computer, this still isn'tright. One kind of violence is being substituted for another. Reconfigure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, I can see why you want to keep the awaymissions to yourself. That's where the excitement is. So, what's beenhappening here? Same old routine, I suppose? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Your reputation precedes you. I'm very pleased you're going tobe improving our system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We did not attack you. We gave chase in order to recover aFederation-owned energy device which <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you remove it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tragedy seems to follow that family. The Admiral lost both hersons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Channelling power to the main, er, deflector dish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More familiarity with our own mythology might help us to relateto theirs. The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hopeof communication, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life. Thank you, NumberOne. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Riker! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only place we can stop this is on the Bridge. Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yours is a different world. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank Aunt Adele. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brainsgrow dependent on the biochips. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What will you do now ? 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you access it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, but it sounds as if with a great deal of hard workand courage, your ancestors changed this world all by themselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's go through all this again. You were sitting there. Therest of us were here. Describe the exact moment when we appeared tofreeze. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was afraid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They captured me to find out how much I knew about theiroperation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your Honour, nothing in this testament proves that Ardra hadthe power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians. My opponent has failedto prove her case and I move that her claim be summarily dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm willing to wager that you trounced your brothers duringthose debates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are a great deal of fluctuations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for humanlife signs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to warp four, Mister Bennett. Set a course for Starbasetwelve. Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan? Yes everything's fine. Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft ofpassion and imagination. That is not who I am. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would rather discuss in person, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think I told you, but I'm glad you're back on theEnterprise. I missed our friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From your knowledge of the man, what has gone wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes, thank you. But I find I'm having to rediscover thatthis is really my home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two days? But that's not enough time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you have, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, and now we must leave you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But futilely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it be telepathic? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What caused the rage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see? You knew how to laugh once. Do you remember any ofthis, Jono? Your parents, your home? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Walker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, our sensors have been rendered ineffective by thefield distortion. I want your analysis. Mister Worf, fire phasers,maximum intensity, limited spectrum. Zero zero one mark zero four five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Captain's prerogative. This one's mine. We have examinedevery conceivable risk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, take a security team up to deck two. Try and breakthrough from below. Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Because for me, none of this will have happened yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Because I'm delighted you did. But, perhaps we shouldcall it a night. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attention all decks. This is to inform you that with yoursupport the Traveller has returned us to our galaxy. However, he hasnow left us. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. Have the boy sentto the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And a ship's cloaking field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's very unusual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you may continue the diagnostic of the transportersystems at another time. Take a shuttlecraft and two more engineersdown to the Romulan ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Simply speaking, we don't trust you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On whether or not it has something to do with the Tox Uthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For what? What have you brought us here for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is everything all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then set course for Sarona Eight. As I remember we were on ourway for some much needed shore leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That seems rather risky, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you won't. Beverly, you know I loathe vacations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you keep me informed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in the lab. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scan for life signs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold for my order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The legend will die, but the people will live. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But your fight with Sarek is over, Spock, and you have nonewith me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible he could have been abducted? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were testing if you can replicate the vaccine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm so sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course, Number One. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I read you, Commander. Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are theylaughing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? The first on. Captain Debin. Captain, let me ask youagain. What are Okona's crimes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Proceed. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Archaeology has been a hobby since Academy days. But why don'twe talk about what really brought you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed of climbinginside the bottle? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, where is Doctor Pulaski. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll be underway as soon as our enginesare online. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There'll be no more punishment on this ship. Now, do yourduties and I'll see to it that we complete our mission and get ourpayment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, keep us within two hundred kilometres of theEnterprise-C. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not any more? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allowthat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To all Starfleet personnel, this is theCaptain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew,Ensign Sito Jaxa <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pass my congratulations to the rest of your team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not friends. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Backup generators. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in alllanguages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are notasking for any terms or conditions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey! You stay put. I'm on my way, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can we be prepared for that which we do not know? But I doknow that we are ready to encounter it. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Divert emergency life support to those decks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The point, Mister Odell. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, determine what these people may have in the way ofemergency needs and provide for them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are his chances? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's have a look. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More like dying, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit othersystems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do yousend messages to other communities, to other places? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasmafield, highly disruptive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like to ask your permission to build something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will take hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maximum shields, ready all weapon systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have developed new defence capabilities since our lastmeeting and we are prepared to use them if you do not withdraw fromFederation space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it's not conclusive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they collaborators? Did they providethe colony's assailants with something that abetted the totaldestruction of Rana Four in order to protect their own lives? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it takes several seconds to materialise. You wouldn't standa chance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I'd like you to talk to Counsellor Troi. She'sexpecting you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolisedby a sun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it's unusual to fly on sensors alone in this type ofmanoeuvre. The pilot relies on visual clues from the other ships tomaintain formation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I understand it has unusual radioactive emissions, and I'msure that Stellar Sciences will find it a most interesting study. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very bitter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what do I do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel auto-destruct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Premier, with all due respect <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am the Captain of this vessel! Your order is nullified! Ferengi on main viewscreen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp two now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me get on the other position. The Bynars always work inpairs. Maybe that is also required. It appears to be successful. Theirsystem's started up. A resident diagnostic programme is running. Theirsystem is absolutely incredible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And they have picked up indications of an intelligent lifeform, though nothing confirmed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're on our way, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. Itis vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling thesenegotiations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't that my speech, Number One? No, of course you're right. We must not get involved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are three Romulans, all of them with disruptors. One atconn. There are none of our security officers on the Bridge. They musthave taken us by surprise. It appears that we can move objects in thistime frame. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to go down to the cemetery. See if you canpinpoint the source. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a difficulty here, one that has forced us toaccelerate this entire process. One of our people is missing. My FirstOfficer, Commander William Riker. He was down on the planet surface,coordinating with the observation team the final details of contact. Hedisappeared. My people have made enquiries but they've not been able tolocate him. If there is anything you can help <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can I help? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's the launch sequence? How do I override the doors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This starship's mission is to seek out new life and that isexactly what Commander Data is doing, under my guidance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassianterritory and some Cardassian colonies in ours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussionsto the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'mhere as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My own counterpart. The captain's final message, praising hiscrew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, thetachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different timeperiods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I meanwhen the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I meaneverything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like thechicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it startedin the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That'swhy it's getting larger in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds like someone who hated life. Yet he had himselffrozen presumably so he could go through it all again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've locked it off. We must find another way to get in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, handle the transporter. Go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, your game was for my benefit. She is innocent in all ofthis. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me about him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The flute? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is the information being sent now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my ship, the leader of an away team has total control of themission. If you want to judge leadership, why not start at thebeginning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My away team is unable to leave the surface because of thestorms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No less so for me. But I promised cooperation, and that's whatwe shall give. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meeting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve that relationship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I have the distinct impression that we're beingtoyed with. Take us back to Rana Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It'salways seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed,Groppler? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready and willing. Able to serve. What would you do? Would youstart as an ordinary crewman? What task is too menial for an entity? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you locate the Krayton? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, couldthat be the Hood returning here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive the intrusion, Captain, but I need some answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a force field at your location. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said you had the realisation of impossible dreams to offerus. When this rescue is completed, I am prepared to listen carefully towhatever proposal you wish to make and subject to it being acceptable Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attempt to make contact, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All of this is true, but there is an old horse trainer's adageabout putting too much weight on a young back. We don't want him tobreak under pressure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we have an onboard communications system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can I get you some coffee? Tea? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's one now. Sakkath knows. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jalad at Tanagra. He went to the same island as Darmok. Darmokand Jalad Tanagra. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enjoy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about thisplanet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You cannot put a price on a life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: See if we can determine their direction. Standard searchpattern. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is something the matter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, there might come some time in the future when she wouldfind out anyway. Another accident, perhaps. Maybe it would be easierfor her if she learned the truth from you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. You are seeing this ship, all of us, from aunique perspective. From a child's point of view. It must seem terriblyunfair and restrictive to you. As adults, we don't always stop toconsider how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of youngpeople. But if you're judging us as a people by the way we treat ourchildren, and I think there can be better criterion, then you mustunderstand how deeply we care for them. When our children are young,they don't understand what might be dangerous. Our rules are to keepthem from harm, real or imagined, and that's part of the continuity ofour human species. When Clara grows up, she will make rules for herchildren to protect them, as we protect her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't know that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the nearest starbase. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Send us your design specifications I'm sure we'll be able tohelp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may have to stretch it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create alifeform? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are we close enough for a scan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Kurn <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just get on with it, Doctor. I've got work to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have been wrestling with that problem too, unfortunatelywithout any success. But we have turned our findings over toStarfleet's most experienced theoretical scientists. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No need to apologise, Ensign. We should have explained itbetter to you at your indoctrination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pardek represented Romulus? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the twoof you will find some way to deal with the situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to complete a level one search? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Part of you must have blamed me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am here at my own request. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is there any way to determine what the destinationof the parent might have been? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At your convenience, Mister Data. Please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kill who? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard representing the United Federation ofPlanets. Guinan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counsellor, do youbelieve a ship Captain should explain every order? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that is your judgement, so be it. We are here to providewhatever service you require. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then let's get to it. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, how will you end the experiment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am not angry with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that would be extremely helpful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please transmit coordinates for immediate transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, this is the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am truly grateful, Mrs. Troi, that you risked your life tosave my people. I'll have you home within a few hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, I want you to access thetransformation programme. And when you're ready, input the symbol. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, provide security. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-Cwill fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,hopefully, will continue for a long while. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So do I, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 45021.3. ConvincingStarfleet Command to establish a blockade was relatively painless. Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't you worry. I won't. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Hold position. Let's see what it does. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, I think I'll go get my jacket. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Mister Worf, the Bridge wouldn't be the same without you. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Introns? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, they used that expertise and turned to cloning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In this case, I think I do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of theEnterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you. Starfleet hasclassified the Cor Caroli Five plague as secret. No cadet would haveknowledge of that incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you spoken with Chief Engineer Argyle about this problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't misunderstand me, Counsellor. Your mother is a beautifulperson, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It enveloped us. It moved. All stations, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel Red alert. Mister Worf, adjust the sensors to compensatefor the distortion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I haveresponsibilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vines infect animals in order to kill them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen anymissile. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of the finest officers that I have ever served with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased to hear that, Gul Dolak, for all of us in theFederation value the peaceful relations with our Cardassian neighbours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long were we out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want to order you. But I ask you. I beg you tovolunteer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll watch this evidence, and we'll weigh itaccordingly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is. Judge Advocate General's Report. Stardate 36764. Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard Pegasus. Basedon testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, theJudge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude thatcertain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just priorto the destruction of the Pegasus. Mutiny on a Federation starship? That's shocking. It's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To die on a transporter. Hardly a fitting end for one of theFederation's most honoured diplomats. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, do you believe that you're in communication with thatobject? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wanted to ask you about Amanda's biological parents. Whenthey decided to remain on Earth, what was the reaction in the QContinuum? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can you determine for certain thatthe energy source from the planet is powering this creation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher to Bridge, urgent. They mustnot be permitted them to destroy us. Or the planet. Captain's log, supplemental. It has been believedthe Tarellian race was extinct, an assumption contradicted now by thesight of one of their vessels approaching Haven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I should say you should, Commander. Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you find them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm afraid not. But we will be visiting the hydroponics andastrophysics laboratories. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will be the first to cheer when the Neutral Zone isabolished. But I wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshapethe entire Romulan political landscape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can it be repaired, at least enough to access the database? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Worf. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we help you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We beamed them up an hour ago. They're fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energy reading? What kind? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're right. We can't react to every random thought thatcrosses the other person's mind. Isn't astonishing, though, how muchclutter there is in a consciousness. Odd memories coming to thesurface. Bitsof half-remembered songs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send yourregrets. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono? Jono, where are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On what basis, Admiral, am I to decide? Your good word? Are youwilling to help us overpower the Romulan B-type warbirds we mayencounter? Are you prepared to help us detect them through theircloaking shields? You see my problem, Admiral. You ask us for faith incircumstances which are hardly possible to believe, compounded by liesand your refusal to tell us all you know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does he need to begin making use of that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We all make mistakes. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. You'll make a fine judge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, well, to tell the truth, that wasn't the first run-in I'dhad with a couple of surly Nausicaans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes! Inside here! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activateprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm merely saying that I'm following up on evidence that myofficers discovered on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We found that world uninhabited. The life forms we left therehad, had sought the challenge. At least, that is the basic reason. Hadsought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there. Life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself aswidely as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shaka. You said that before. When I couldn't build a fire. Isthat a failure? An inability to do something? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In an age when their technology should be able to clothe andfeed all of them, that they should have to live like this. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. Myvision is blurred. I'm going to get worse, not better. I'm not going tobe able to help you. Now, you are going to have to stand up to Dirgo onyour own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trespassing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't afford to take it easy, Doctor. Tell me,where is Lieutenant Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on alldecks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucersection, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find that almost impossible to believe. That Admiral Kennellywould considersupplying weapons to the terrorists? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think we have seen all there is to see here. At MisterO'Brien's leisure, we're ready to return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We both fell down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk yourlife to lead it personally? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know what all this is about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How's our mediator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So far. He must be torn. These are his people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then our business with you is concluded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When you're ready, coordinate with Mister Data. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I gather you were unsuccessful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that what they are? Tests of pain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you care to be shown to your quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That explains, Riker. What about me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're responsible for new starship development. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happening? Who's transferred the voice authorisation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eighteen years? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Name. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll remain here. It's safer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's going to lose. The Nausicaan is cheating. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long to the field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A life form. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Apgar killed himself during his attempt to killCommander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any further advice, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if it doesn't? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Logical. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to one quarter impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. You've covered all the bases. What's your impression ofShelby? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're staring at me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you were born Jeremiah on Galen Four. The colony wasdestroyed later, during a border skirmish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Away team, prepare to return to the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interrogate him here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, he has access to the computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There she is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whenever I get insomnia, I try to perfect the recipe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vividly. But if I have forgotten my closest friends andcomrades, as you say, I deserved every word. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what was your impression of Graves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently we were all unconscious forabout thirty seconds. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what was this programme designed to do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I won't leave you. Please, let go of me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Both of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Absolutely not. This vaccine sample is a gift of life and weare honoured at receiving it. Would you do us the additional honour ofnow letting us entertain you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We tookyou away from it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theEnterprise. We are transmitting visually. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can you tell me about our captors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are not alive. As I said before, you are only <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I look forward to your reports. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not if you were to help me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct MisterWorf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where exactly do you come from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are these animals doing here, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds,the very touch of things, much more real than a dream. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! I never sought that rubbish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A minor mystery?. That seems to be a recurring phrase thesedays. Oh, Diomedian scarlet moss. I didn't know you were anenthnobotanist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems. Atthe moment, we are adrift. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They will live their lives and never know any difference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There will be three Cardassianstransporting aboard. Their Captain, Gul Macet and two of his aides. Myintention is to be as open as possible with them, allow them to sharein our search for the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does the supply ship have any weapons? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did he seem then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gowron or K'Tal? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm feeling very much better. in fact, I don't intend to go onusing this any longer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need your help. The situation is not good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you are going to have to keep a rein on Dirgo. He'swilful and stubborn. That's dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is Q? If you have any answer to any of this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None at all? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in intercept course. Go to yellow alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of threat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, welcome home. First Officer's log, stardate 4124.5. We have foundData's home to be a completely dead world made out of lifelessvegetation. No insects, not even soil bacteria. What is it that couldkill everything on an entire planet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite certain, Data. By all means, demonstrate your gifts ofaffection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I were, would you give it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None that I can see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More is stronger. Captain's log, supplemental. We have regainedvisual contact with the lab, but our attempts to restore communicationwith this microbrain, as we have come to call it, has beenunsuccessful. One thing that is certain, however. This life form hasdeclared war on us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An excellent reason to escape. Do you think you've gained hisconfidence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of aspatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in theNeutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's make this transfer with alldeliberate speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no. No Earth ship of that time could have travelled outthis far. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not true. I have the deepest deal of respect for yourbeliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to know we're very proud of thescience fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue acareer in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your scienceprojects? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Male or female? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, set course zero fiveeight, mark one seven three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Once again, welcome on board, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if at all possible, we will continue this mission asplanned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless it's followed by three wavy lines, in which case the Zbecomes a B. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, who is real here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Point one impulse, Number One. RIKER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My fault? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And this? You have no other portraits of your fellow crewmembers. Why this person? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's part of being human, Jono. But, as deeply as you can feelhurt, you can also feel joy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, that is sufficient. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Empty your minds of violent thoughts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sunad, this individual is a guest aboard our ship. We found himdying in a shipwreck. We returned him to health. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You made a decision to leave the ship? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The incident that you wereinvolved in at the Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to beam him out of there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've read your reports. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In fact, the Admiral is fact suggesting you be moved to GalorFour, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the viewer ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The entire orchestra? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long until we clearCardassian space? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to see him right now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make itlook as though we're trying to stop them. Mister Worf, lock phasers ontheir previous position and fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I wantyou there when the away team returns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The explanation is simple. Your attempt to capture our ship hasfailed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf is not gone. The family you served needs you again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course for Seronia. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot believe this was not an arbitrary attack. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, visual on K'Nera. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my ready room. The seven people on that ship are our firstpriority. Is the probe ready for launch? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you speak to it? Does it speak to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I have a word with you, alone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, would you care to join me for some late dinner? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you certain, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, go back to the biofilter readouts taken of the awayteam's transport from the moon's surface. See if you can come up withany clue that might explain this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Doctor, how do we kill them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a terrifying prospect to lose control of one's mind. WhenI was young, I remember watching my grandfather deteriorate from apowerful, intelligent figure to a frail wisp of a man, who could barelymake his own way home. Mister Data, it is my responsibility somehow tosee that this ship is guided to safety. I will need to rely on you fromnow on. We may need to count on you for our very survival. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Under these circumstances, Number One, I think that would beinappropriate. Second officer's log, Stardate 43611.6. Programmingof the holodeck has taken eighteen hours eleven minutes, and is nowcomplete. All participants have entered their depositions. Technicalschematics and complete records from the lab's ground computers, aswell as Doctor Apgar's personal logs, have been included. Therecreations will have a nominal eight point seven percent margin oferror. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The other two Enterprises, they're on theirway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sidney. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Have you cancelled your leave? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you need me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are dangerous. They're only victims. You made them whatthey are. You asked them to defend your way of life and then youdiscarded them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, you've been at this for hours. You might think moreclearly if you got a good night's sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. So some external force was needed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Begin as soon as you're ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And all available personnel, including you and me, will beginto put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew onboard the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who authorised a launch? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you did steal it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there are only six ships. We could even cut back thatnumber. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will hold its position, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A cellular fossil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Manoeuvring thrusters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not low enough to beam them out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I relieve you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he going to be all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. It's the first time in almost twenty years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it's true, I have been preoccupied. I know that's notvery flattering to you, but I have been thinking about us. And aboutthe choices I've made. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, sir. No one was on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The pursuing ship is the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope this will be brief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't belong on that ship, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? Yes, yes, of course. Proceed, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leaving my career, the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you tried tracing back navigation inputs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is it now, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Myriap! Enough. Without cooperation we will get nowhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is imperative that you hold yourposition until we finish evacuating the colony. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we firstencountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A simple handshake would have sufficed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you, Mister Data. Procedures require that weinvestigate. Recall the bridge crew and set in a course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I'm Captain Picard. This is Commander William Riker. He will be yielding the firstofficer's position to you during your tour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I shall want an answer to that. I'm sure the Tanugans will too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your offer, Lieutenant, but this is myresponsibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are trifling with the primal instincts of our species. Imust warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for theirchildren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all. I'm here studying the intricacies of Bajoranaqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your reportas almost magical attempts to please us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I think he can help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He had a kind face. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Someone left this junction box open. I thought your crewwas supposed to be off the ship once the field diverters were in place. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One. Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't care what you believe! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Receptacles? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. We will transmit the information shortly. Enterpriseout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's reassuring. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have security evacuate all personnel from thosedecks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through theregular transporting procedure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, the circumstance of their death's quite odd. A tornadosomehow escaped the weather modification net and touched down in onlyone spot. Amanda's home. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you'll like serving on board theAjax. I hear that Captain Narth is an excellent officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can you hear me? Data, respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many generations are we dealing with here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How far inside Cardassian space is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you predict how long this has been in the cavern? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transport. This may be a littletricky. I would like you to handle it. LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's something else. Since his recovery, he's manifestedunusual abilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An opportunity to learn from one another. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The facts are here. At least show them to someone who willrecognise what they mean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I told you he was the best. I'd like to hear about this, NumberOne, later. Right now I have to work something out with Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You found what you were looking for, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out ofhere? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mixed feelings for all of us. It's always difficult leaving anyship, just as it was for your mother <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Might there be some side effect of Cairn telepathy of whichwe're unaware? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you care for something? So, Beverly. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying this ship has lost nearly eighthundred of its personnel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is no need to make threats. We each know theconsequences. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, full about. Go to warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When the Yamato was probed, where was she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't do this, this, this you do with men. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rishon, I can touch you. I can hear your voice, I can smellyour perfume. In every respect you are a real person with your own mindand beliefs, but you do not exist. You died along with the others,defending the colony. He recreated you, just as he recreated the house. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. WORF <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, ready an away team. Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit aboveTurkana Four, an Earth colony that severed relations with theFederation nearly fifteen years ago. I am concerned about sending anaway team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two missingFederation crewmen, I see no alternative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you hadn't grabbed my sword we'd be back in Sherwood by now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. Thatcould be significant. Look, there it is again, and again. And thereagain. This is obviously an important pairing. He isn't chasing heranymore. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I need to know what's on the shuttle's logs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reunification? After so many centuries? After so manyfundamental differences have evolved between your peoples? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can scan the interior? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seen to be an ancient interplanetary code. MisterData? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On what grounds? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will not serve you here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've spent a good deal of time on the surface. How do yousuggest we change their minds? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are the defensive capabilities of the Central Command? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, why haven't you left that building? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what exactly is this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in that course, Ensign, and engage at full impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What else would it be? My heart was injured and a replacementwas necessary. That would have been it, except that the replacement isfaulty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, Data. At least you're functioning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caughton a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander MacDuff, set a course for the Lysian Central Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Visit their ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, we could make use of that. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wes, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status report, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona, you were welcomed aboard without any undueinvestigation. In turn it was assumed that you did not come under falsepretenses. It now seems that you may have done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Tholl! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't we use Riker? He's a Starfleet Commander. He couldtalk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions. Then when their shields go down, we can beam the artefacts up herewithout ever leaving the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is either populated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scanning and recording as we go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want you both to becompletely familiar with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That does not justify brutalising her, nor any of the othersyou have used. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Security, disregard that order, and clear all personnel,repeat, all personnel, from Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There'll be no conflict. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you launch a full-scale attack now, then the Duras fleetwill call for supplies. Lursa and B'Etor will call for help. TheRomulans will try to run the blockade, and we'll be ready for them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dear God. Let's salvage what we can. The first thing we'll needis shelter from the sun. In this heat, the shuttle will act like anoven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin monitoring Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone,Mister Data. Have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can I do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would explain why they're so far awayfrom Romulan space. To avoid being picked up on Federation long rangescans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return that moon to its orbit. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well then, let's move on to the environmental gains on VentaxTwo. How were those accomplished <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbolrepresents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyonehas a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what do you read? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When you were here last, you were saying that you were feelingtired. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She decided to leave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deceive them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted newspecies, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thanks, Number One. He's my number one Dad. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to say. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It has declared a state of war and we are on the defensive. Wehave no control over our Medical Lab nor our computer. At this momentit has the power to destroy this ship and everybody on it. I need yourhelp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, by this time tomorrow we could be back on the Enterpriseand you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife andfork. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: His visit is not just an inspection of Lal's progress. He hasexpressed a concern for her environment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. Data, I have todestroy this. This control room and its technology must not be allowedto fall into Romulan hands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have to like her, Will, but we have to follow herorders, and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves nopurpose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because there is something else you can learn. With an alertcrew, even our primitive vocal communications are unnecessary. With asingle look I was able to inform my crew that I wanted to hold youhere. 4 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little disoriented, that's all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet youknew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct thatis uncivilised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not him, Will. I know that now. What I have to find out ishow this happened, and who or what is behind it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said there were only two of you left. What happened to the rest of the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I should think the shifting passions of this beast would be farmore terrifying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You expect me to apologise to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami. Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What will you do now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there any other Romulans we should be looking to recoverfrom Galorndon Core? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If it was the probe, that explains theYamato. But how do you account for the difficulties the Enterprise isexperiencing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riva, Commander Data has learned your sign language. Talk tous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume that you're referring to Kahless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, old friend. How are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which you do very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I need those logs. Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I knew. Q first became interested in him at Farpoint. Ihave no idea what it means. Meanwhile, we must proceed with our rescuemission. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have found our Titania. Don'tyou agree? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will be all, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me where you've hidden the Tox Uthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No sign of others? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before we regain attitude control? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Follow your orders? The orders of a small man trying to fill arole too big for him. I say it's time for a change. Who's with me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report to Mister Data. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Worf! All of you. Don't respond. Don't provoke themfurther. Keep those weapons down unless you wish to be killed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, we have a few things to discuss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am much relieved, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I mustrespectfully decline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'll be irrational. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just not one who stands out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only too well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to this location. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is wrong with me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A spy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frightenother predators and to mark territory, and to commence mating process. A mating process. Counsellor Troi was bitten by a Klingon but not in aplace that might be life-threatening. Nowhere near a major artery ororgan. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was neverintended to give her any kind of serious harm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're forcing a difficult decision on me,Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That you voluntarily confine yourself to your quarters, atleast until we haveunraveled this mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easilyto my people, Gul Macet. You have much to learn about us. BenjaminMaxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him. You know, inwar, he was twice honoured with the Federation's highest citation forcourage and valour. And if he could not find a role for himself inpeace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He can take all the credit he wants, I don't caret. But I doneed a ship. Well if Gowron won't talk to me, get someone who will. Somebody on theHigh Council. K'Tal, perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to returnwith us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinityof Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bringthis life form into being. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have the two of you met before? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Excellent. Fourteen hundred hours, then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, get us out of here. Warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Memory, save current setting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chairman Songi, we will proceed immediately to your planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When I have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growthagain. It needs must wither. Nine, eight. 'Tis better to have loved andlost than never to have loved at all. Seven, six <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulans were impressed, to say the least. After years ofdistrust and conflict, they started to talk. You were our key spokesmanin securing the alliance with the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their pastassociates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might behere too and we have to find out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vash. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. Weare not the enemy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. This is theEnterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed anunfriendly act. We insist that you reply immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The strategic decision is to send one ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set coordinates for main Bridge. Portforward for me and aft for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that cando all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starbase Montgomery is sending a civilian advisor on board tobrief you on the Ares's mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can relax, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I can assure you that will not go down well atStarfleet Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what are your thoughts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's see if we can outrun them. Lieutenant La Forge, I wantmaximum warp <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we modify the subspace isolators to give us betterprotection? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You want me to bring you back a souvenir? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, every person on that ship over there died. Is there anychance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, these are questions that mankind has been struggling withthroughout history. Your confusion is only human. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the Ferengi pod, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You never intended to burn that second disc. If you had, youwouldn't have been so careless as to allow Sovak to salvage any of it. You wanted him to follow us, so that he could see for himself that theUthat wasn't at the cave site. That was the only way he could beconvinced that your quest had been futile. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, begin a level one diagnostic. All transportersystems offline until further notice. Could they have materialisedsomewhere else? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, a word. We have some information you should beaware of. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Phaser. Destroy the sphere. Destroy the sphere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be back before Jimmy Cuzzo arrives. I guarantee it will betaken care of. Just relax. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have already reported our position and the nature of thisviolation to Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate theanomaly in the Devron System. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Drop to impulse, Ensign. Mister Worf, maximum shields. Readyall weapons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course you are concerned, Gul Macet. It is precisely becauseof that fact that I have included you in every aspect of our effort. You're present with my staff. You're hearing reports as I hear them,nothing edited, nothing withheld. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So then you deliberately used Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, thank you, dear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, could this be a Dyson Sphere? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief Inspector, we've watched the eventsreplayed over and over again and I am impressed, and admittedlydismayed by the body of evidence against Commander Riker. But isn't itremarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points ofview of the events aboard the space station, we haven't seen whatreally happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Patch visual to Observation lounge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Mendrossen <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. Inour arrogance we feel we are so advanced, and yet we cannot unravel asimple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone,without a computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, take him to Sickbay. Maybe Pulaski can help. Listen to me. You are not alone. Do you understand? We areall in this together now. Captain's log, supplemental. We are monitoringincreased military activity on Solais Five. I fear that without Riva,we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What female are you referring to? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe. But she, or someone like her, will always be with us,waiting for the right climate in which to flourish, spreading fear inthe name of righteousness. Vigilance, Mister Worf, that is the price wehave to continually pay. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: This disc must contain some very valuable information. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. Reverse course. Full impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral. I have to tell you, you must notexpect me to permit any action against Mister Tarses solely on thebasis of Betazoid intuition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Believe it. I'd been sent to make preliminary overtures to atruce. I'd lowered my shields as a gesture of good will. But theCardassians were not impressed. They had taken out most of my weaponsand damaged the impulse engines before I could regroup and run. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, how do you intend to free yourselves of this existencethat has so trapped your consciousness? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this your doing, Q? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whether we approve of the Zalkonians' intentions is not theissue. But for what it's worth, I believe John is correct that hisexistence has broader ramifications than that of a simple criminal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. Wehave engaged the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is some greeting, old friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you certain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can no longer afford to be patient. Unless we act soon,Esoqq will starve. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps later. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Follow him! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Try it now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders? How? Duringthe missing day, were you contacted by Starfleet? Did they order you toconceal the truth from us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Data. But shut down the other holodecks until you'refinished, just to be on the safe side. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've discussed that. We are studying means of bringing hersafely off the holodeck. But five hours is not enough time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Liko. Liko, I am a man. I am not the Overseer. I am atraveller from a faraway land. Nothing more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Last week when you scored two touches, you liked it wellenough. Today you were dropping your foil. You kept letting me inside. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite nice. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The men you helped rescue are safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeplygrateful for your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you getus home? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myselfhere. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beam up the away team immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, I have some bad news. There hasbeen an accident. Your mother has died. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know anymore. I just don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it to the wall, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's right. I'm fine. What is this all about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You didn't mention you were that certain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have access to it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's alcohol. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll discuss this after we've transport over. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I trust you will be comfortable here. If you will excuseme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now please, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Animal things? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I recognise that you're trying to satisfy my conditions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulsepower, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengitransmissions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Countess, you must understand that I am responsible for morethan one thousand lives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know who or what Darmok and Jalad are, but I certainlydidn't come here to start a war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wasn't aware that he had. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When time resumed, did you observe any activity in the engineroom that might <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister La Forge, it would seem that time is something wehave plenty of. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it have been a natural phenomenon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. Slow to one third impulse power. Bring us to onezero three mark zero two five. Mister Worf, hail the alien vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, put us into synchronous orbit above thatposition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does that custom extend also to brutalising this surrogate son? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would it be simpler if I were not your commanding officer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkwardtransition. You're the next likely choice. And Mister Mendozawill certainly agree. He's quite impressed by your natural instincts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, really? Not as a wedding present for Sir Guy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough! I'm not going to fight you. You'll just have to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security, this is the Captain. Security? Engineering, this is the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goodness had nothing to do with it. Three to beam up. MisterData will remain on the surface. Data, I want a complete report on thecontents of these documents. I refuse to abandon this planet to thatwoman. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not necessarily to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What could they possibly be doing down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Captain Riker. The Romulan Ambassador is readyto transport over from the Decius. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will end this war, if you will end the war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And our response? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easyto spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are wellcamouflaged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister Worf. Let's hope we don't haveto use them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A bad love affair ends in a bloodyshoot-out, the hotel gets bought out, and life goes on, such as it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, use whatever means to neutralise the intruder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will, you'reready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And, youknow, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, activate Picard Mozart trio,programme one. Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you are endangering yourself and the away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Come down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Walter Horne? Is he still teaching? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Well, I look forward to it. Excuse me. Commander, we needto begin a full spectrographic analysis of the Dyson Sphere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, you're just in time. They're about to disembark. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen! On screen! Let's see it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? Children on the Enterprise? Guinan, we're at war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You or I could learn to live with that disability, but not Worf. His life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it, we don't have to understand it, but we do have to respect his beliefs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are you certain that this is the right decision? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lantree. Are you under attack? Lantree? Lantree, this isthe Enterprise. Come in, Lantree. Replay that last transmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This ship has encountered several incidents which might suggesta potential alliance between those two powers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Repeat the hail all channels. You see, they have no way ofknowing how accurate our sensors are. Put on your best poker face,Number One. Open a frequency. Commander Tomalak. It would appear ouraway team has rescued a second man from your one man ship. We'repreparing to beam them to the Enterprise. After which, of course, wewill return the survivor to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Believe what you wish. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you and Mister Data will accompany me. MisterO'Brien can keep a lock on our communicators. He can pull us out ifnecessary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And who speaks for his family now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I look forward to your report, Mister Broccoli. Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by a moment on that. Wesley. Wes. Are you aware thatyou're acting strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over fromthe Tsiolkovsky which acts like intoxication? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not accusing you of anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Traveller moved through time using the power of his mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Here. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A gateway? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you done to her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this a personal matter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard'sinterlink system. I think that it uses some kind of phased-pulsetechnology. Do you think it could be modified to generate a kedionpulse that would reboot Data'sprogramme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chart it. I want to see if there's a pattern. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the increase in efficiency? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then give me a Level One diagnostic of any onboard sensors, andrun a manual sweep of any anomalous airborne or electromagneticreadings. I want some answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm convinced the damage will be irreparable if they'reseparated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want some explanations from Lutan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And another William Riker materialised there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing onTilonian culture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it was necessary to keep me captive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're saying I should just sit down, shut up and wait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Locarno. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied to himabout the Engine Room. There were no volatile chemicals found there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a provision in the Federation Constitution thatprotects an individual's fundamental rights. Now once you were broughtaboard this ship <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Check with Mister La Forge. See ifhe found anything in the matter sample from the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe our best chance of escaping this situation is for meto pilot the shuttle. It's my ship, Will. I've got to do this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm certain, Number One. I want you to stay close. Keep youreye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving hima full medical examination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I knew of him. He was teaching at the University when I was inParis, but I didn't have the pleasure. I must change. Number One,inform me half an hour before we reach those co-ordinates. Keep tryingto determine if the time distortion was specifically located on theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me some options, Data, quickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Steady as she goes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Its telemetry failed. It was never heardfrom again. Do you believe that you've discovered the remains ofColonel Richey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. You should proceed with your mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrangetransport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to movequickly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only logical solution. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Since the days of the first wooden sailing ships, all captainshave enjoyed the happy privilege of joining together two people in thebonds of matrimony. And so it is my honour to unite you, KeikoIshikawa, and you, Miles Edward O'Brien, together in matrimony <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, has the boy volunteered any further information? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough. Q, what exactly is going on. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open. What crimes are you referring to? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After you. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet's finest. Fancy meeting you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I've done everything that Geordisaid. Now to activate it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've foundout that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it'sonly petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I hadbeen part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do they mean to carry out their threat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand that. But Ineed to know more. You must tell me more about Darmok and Jalad. Tellme. You used the words, 'Temba, his arms wide' when you gave me theknife and the fire. Could that mean give? Temba, his arms wide. Darmok. Give me more about Darmok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps in this case, rethinking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any theories? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you write it out? I am so sorry that your friends werekilled. I'm sorry, I don't know what you are trying to tell me. We haveto find some way to communicate with him. Data, he knows some kind ofgestural language. Find our which one and learn it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm asking you. That is an order, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Brull, will you show Mister Crusher thecourse to set to the Hromi Cluster? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand there are nuances that only Kerelians can pick up. We just don't have the ears for it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not our planet, sir, but I will present your needs tothose who do govern this world. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts. But you see,there were no storm fronts in Kansas that day. Witnesses reported thatthe funnel materialised spontaneously directly over Amanda's home,destroyed it, and disappeared. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll be taken to the nearest starbase and held responsiblefor the attack on the Enterprise, and possibly the deaths of eleventhousand people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean he can talk? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not convinced that you are fully Q. And they are alsoresponsible for your parent's death. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How critical will the losses be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, will you report to my Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's odd. We weren't notified of a rendezvous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi, there is something you ought to know about Rex. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, Number One, you missed something not playing withmodel ships. They were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding atreasure of adventures. Manning the earliest space craft, flying aaeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Can youimagine that? Now the machines are flying us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened on Rana Four? The truth this time. All of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have a moon inexplicably falling out of orbit, and just nowthis ship was probed with Berthold radiation. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, would you join me in my Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has a legal claim, Mister Worf. Your personal feelingstoward him <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to hiscaptivity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Congratulations, Doctor. This is an amazing achievement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you recognised him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. So, it begins. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A distortion wave. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Interesting question. How long to prepare to die? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Alexander, would you mind if I borrowed your toy for alittle while? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am alsobound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. And Iwill not sacrifice them in order to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And yet you survived. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know. But I wanted to go riding, but I didn't have mysaddle, so I went back to get it and <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before we can return to warp power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er,um, married? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: 47988. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have decided to accept your proposal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oppido bonum. Your Latin has improved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Why was it dangerous? What is happening to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Comments. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From the same source as before? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let's find out. Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil am I doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Escape? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You led us quite a chase, Mister Crusher. Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can boost the output field, I might be able to send adistress signal. Something seems to be wrong with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll agree that we should quarantine the Lantree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I noticed that Lieutenant Worf put Ensign D'Amato on report forinsubordination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort the Doctor to her quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm beginning to realise that you seem to always have someacerbic remark on the tip of your tongue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and thensuddenly to be here, right in front of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't depend on it. For all we know, he may still be lying, butwe shall find that out soon enough. Number One, set course for NelvanaThree. Second officer's log, stardate 43465.2. We haveentered the Neutral Zone in direct violation of the Treaty of Algeron. Presuming Romulan warships are cloaked and monitoring us, we expectheavy resistance as we approach Nelvana Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, hurry! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why has everything become a something, or a whatever? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remember what you told me back at RelvaSeven, About the threat that you perceived to the very fabric of theFederation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn it, who's out there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was Malencon doing when he was killed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any. My apologies for saying that you babbled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How's your patient? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put yourself in her place. You see, she cannot kill a hornbuckat a great distance. You can. You have a power she lacks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we must convince the Romulans that we're stilllooking for the Pegasus. I want you to continue scanning this system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you let us help you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bringing it up here was the right thing todo, Number One. We were just saying, Data, that if your duplicatefunctions, it might answer a lot of questions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami, may I speak with you in private? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach. Ambassador, I have tell you that in my culture, what you have donewould be considered a crime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two days ago, you were so upset about the Borg even being onthe ship that you tore my foil out of my hand. And now you're herequestioning whether it should be treated as the enemy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not see what I can do to assist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you willservice us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want to use you as other men do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beyond? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm so sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't you answer my questions? What ship? I'd like to lookat the passenger list. Where have you been living here? What's yourposition? Who are your neighbours? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I suppose that is the end of Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As it was to our father. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Borg have been busy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close rangefrom a camouflaged observation post. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you have just said there are only two challengers arriving. What is the point? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship waslooking for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, tell me if. It's good to see you again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to warp engines, factor one. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have? I'm really sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I walked. For hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that this malfunction will affect the otherholodecks as well? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortalityrate. Two point four percent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on downthere is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it's true, I have done my homework I have examined thefindings of every archaeological expedition conducted on the planetsurface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that after a while you'll be able to adjust. They saywhen one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to compensate. A blind man develops better hearing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Will. I never made that log entry, of course, but itstill leaves you with a duty to perform. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do yousense an alien presence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying she's been bitten? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Admiral. It may not be easy for you and I to see her thatway, but he does. And I respect that. They will remain here for now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What a tangled web we weave. I have difficulty rememberingwhose side I'm on. So, what have you been able to find out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gibberish? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you don't know how to align a control coil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, what's our at the planet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not him I'm inclined to judge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Every living thing on the planet will perish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We understand what you are saying. We will leave you. We willsend you home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought that the weather controlmalfunction was not severe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can hardly believe this will convince anyone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate the transformation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It isn't specific. It simply refers toforeign investors. Sale price, twelve point five million United States <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you seem to have developed anaffinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can hebe trusted? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None at all, Mister Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I'veprovided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Perhaps you'd liketo make use of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That area was colonized fairly recently, as I recall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They don't like cold, eh? Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, continue your scan. Ensign, link navigationalcontrol to Mister Data's console and plot a course for that distortion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I understand your frustration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not curious or concerned as to why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, he admits his mistake in falsifying his application. Thatdoes not make him a traitor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready roomcan possibly be of interest to future historians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you care to comment privately how youread any of this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago,Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We haveto get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to crossthe border? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, very convenient. We beam you back aboard your old shipand we have to take a risk that you won't change your mind and betrayus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're probably not aware of this, but I have never beenparticularly comfortable around children. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression ofme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the tremors have frightened people, leading to this hysteriaover Ardra, let us reassure them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sort them out, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, what you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral. I'll fight it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When she left to become head of StarfleetMedical. But going from one assignment to another is part of the lifewhich you are choosing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's concentrate on how this anomaly wasinitially formed. Speculation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I think we can resume the sequence. Counsellor Troi istaking care of the situation on deck seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even then there's no guarantee that we'll find a suitableplanet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sir, I see no way to protect the Cardassian peace withoutsacrificing the Bajorans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona to the Bridge immediately. Open. The same demandhas been made by the Atlec legation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It could be that whatever caused this situation also affectedData. And it could be that he's telling the truth and that this is alljust a minor mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's talk about that later, shall we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems that Mrs Troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill fortoday. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They want us to find it. They would havekept it simple. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, there's something's wrong here. Now, Beverly, this ismore than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand. Tellme, why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Once? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A captain's log? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have forty crewmembers on board the Hathaway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's an emotional response, Will. We can't afford it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare to transport Ambassador T'Pel to the Romulan ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Mister Worf, you will report back to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just what is the evidence against myofficer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Canyou identify whoever or whatever you are? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island. Temba,his arms wide. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even Parliament's peacemakers may find this case a littledifficult. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold for my orders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, evenunder these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering. Get the core back online. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Taggert, if she served you as well as you say, why didyou let her go? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's really quite exciting, actually, if you understand thepotential of exploring a new world on our own planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll wait a bit more, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. What is emanating here is having repercussions light yearsaway, maybe even further. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must love her very much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm wary about making changes in this time continuum until weunderstand more about what's going on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, did something unusual just occur on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has it been that apparent? How well you know me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait. Oh, Data. Your whisper from the dark has now become aplea. We cannot turn our backs. Captain's log, stardate 42741.3. We are enteringinto orbit of Drema Four, the planet from which Data received thedistress signal. Sensors indicate that the volcanic activity isincreasing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position toyour government if you wish, in case you're unable to complete yourrepairs and you remain stranded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that now would be quite nice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon can you do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you report it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The good news. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open the frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss itin the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, Irealised that I didn't have those feelings any more. Twenty years is,after all, a long time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, have a safe trip home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carryon. Ship's log, Commander William Riker reporting. Continuing our appraisal of Ligonian technology. The Captain has madeit clear he wants Lieutenant Yar beamed immediately to safety if herlifeshould become endangered, and I fervently hope the rules of thatcontest make it possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep her under guard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can you make head or tail of it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would expect nothing less. It won't be for long, Will. Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I notice you haven't taken off your gloves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the weather modificationnet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell meabout these patterns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What I want to know is why? You seemed so happy just a fewhours ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worfthat I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyaltythan rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you'renot the Worf once I knew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you have the advantage. Is this Bok? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's on his way, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise that. But it's safer for all concerned to leave onebehind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Abort it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, would you enlighten us? What is required forsentience? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Singh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will. Look, I'm sorry, I cannot help you to make this decision, but I can tell you this. Klingons choose their friends with great care. If he didn't know he could count on you, he never would have asked. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It breaks my heart to look at him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell him I'm looking forward to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For a later discussion. Number One, I think we should get onwith our mission. Starfleet can send a science vessel back toinvestigate further. Move us back out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a perfectly good shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An enormous amount of data is being received and stored in themain computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why Istarted to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What threat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn'tfunction by conjecture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Most likely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Cancel Red alert, Lieutenant. Commander, we shallreturn your officer and escort your ship to the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite possibly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm glad you could join us, Mister Barclay. Your report, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are aware of that, Electorine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Varley died believing that it was. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you are? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. And so these <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like that very much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're going to be with us for a while. Let's find out all wecan about them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've diverted the reserve power to thefamily decks. They'll last longest. Is there anything else we can do,Doctor? Where's Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Breakfast? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How will you gain access? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't thinkit's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf willaccompany you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right, you should. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try and take us out of here. Maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kamala? Yes. She's looking forward to meeting you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as ittravelled through space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room two, prepare to energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nuria, don't be afraid. No one is going to harm you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And these blood feuds could last for decades? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The test is if a crew will follow where Commander Riker leads. His joviality is the means by which he creates that loyalty. And I willmatch his command style with your statistics any time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. Whatreport on the logs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're bringing you in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Data, the nearest pulsar is inthe Lonka cluster, is it not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's a symptom of fatigue. We've all been inflicted onetime or another with that melody that won't go away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He knows. And more than that. On this mission he has beenconsciously holding Sarek's mind together as well as he could. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirtyminutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'll take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it. Mister Data,you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you wish, Mister Tholl. We must get inside this panel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? What do you see? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. How do you make small talk with someone who shaped theFederation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I haven't as yet, Number One. I didn't think it was myresponsibility alone. His remaining will create difficulties for usall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The boy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I would deeply regret it if you were returning only toease diplomatic tensions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in amoment. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It happened when I reached for the bowl of fruit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, return to the ship immediately. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. Resume. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Prime Minister. Enterprise, prepare to beam theaway team back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can imagine. Doctor Crusher told me that there were possiblydozens of personalities inside you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you who attacked the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Galen to Bridge. Alter course for Vulcan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Problem, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid. Splendid. Carry on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, perhaps it would be best if we discussed this <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to theshuttlebay? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. But if this was a ship full of utopians, whycarry all this technological baggage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Absolutely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you think it's wise for you to go there alone? Afterall, they were expecting Baran to show up. Don't you think if I were to accompany you, it might seem moreplausible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course you were, DaiMon. But you're still holding LwaxanaTroi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would it surprise you to learn that he found them equallyvaluable? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thirty seven through thirty nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless withoutrisk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it ifyou'd let me finish my sentences once in a while. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to away team. Prepare to return to the shipimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will leave and never return. Chancellor, we are here only tohelp guide you into a new era. I can assure you we will not interferein the natural development of your planet. That is, in fact, our PrimeDirective. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitationalforce of a hundred stars. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how is it able to move? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope I've not embarrassed you, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, this channel will remain open. Pleasecontinue to report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that by not cooperating, you are actuallyprotecting us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is she alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am not being unreasonable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose, I suppose it must be. I was hoping for more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, where are you off to now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. But youall right though? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because you'd already been there once before, probably themoment you arrived on the planet. That's when you found it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasytruce with the Moropa, are they not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I thinkthat Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze ofglory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the KolvoordStarburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked,you would thrill the assembled guests and Locarno would graduate as aliving legend. Only it didn't work, and Joshua Albert paid the price. Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question. Am I correct? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, how? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Holodeck three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should confine him to quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, no! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, Iwill release my officer into your custody. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Corey, that won't solve anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Commander Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What you have done will have seriousramifications. I am truly dismayed that you toldno one of what you were doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I imagine you know why I've asked you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before we have warp power again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. Commander, will you accompany Mister Worf to biolabfour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This will be the test. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, this is unusual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We almost always encounter shock and fear on this sort ofmission. We hope that you will help us facilitate our introduction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An entire civilisation that's terminally ill. Is it reversible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, when I left this ship, it was in one piece. Iwould appreciate your returning it in the same condition. Do youconcur, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened between your people and the Borg? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who? Who was the traitor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I just wanted to see if you were still listening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to programme thephasers, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is the fourth intersect in Jefferies tube twentyfive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So did I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: First we've got to get the ship under control. Let's go to theBridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you, are you children all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Plot an intercept course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, do we have him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not in here. Hey, you, where's the artefact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Commander Data in particular? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard, Captain of this vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the news were encouraging, I assume youwould not be here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me more about this One. Does he have a name? Is he calledHugh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer areincompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time ofwar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're fine. Everything is in order. But now, I want a completecheck, all systems, all divisions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are preparing to do so. And, Captain, you're getting a fineofficer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But theProfessor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices insidethe one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voiceinside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was self-defence. He fired on my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To whom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She was born to do this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the cause is just and honourable, they are prepared to givetheir lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. But I would prefer more recent intelligence on theexact layout of the installation. The most current information we haveis two years old. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any activity at the meeting site? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any prior malfunctions on this transporter unit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The planets that these fragments are from are scattered acrossthe quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor so long to collect them. But why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is something I want you to see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Yes. Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As I understand it, over time they have become sointerconnected with the master computer on their planet that theirlanguage, their thought patterns have become as close to binary as it'spossible for organic beings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bearing and speed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready for San Francisco, Mister Whalen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, when you scanned the temporal aperture with yourtricorder, it caused time to move forwards and then back again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reduce engine power. Tractor beam off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that everybody? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's been locked out with the rest of the commandfunctions. RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, have you launched the probe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of co-ordinatesnear Romulus and to bring us back, and that is all I am prepared todiscuss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know, Mister Data. Can we establish communication? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, you're Ronin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where are youfrom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm inclined to agree. I don't think that forty eight hours istoo much time to risk particularly when the gains areso substantial. You may proceed, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You did not think so when it worked in your favour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By whom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have no choice. Prepare to receive us. We're beaming onboard. Picard out. Cancel Red Alert. Tell Sovereign Marouk meet me intransporter three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After they died? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, bon voyage, Mister Scott. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. That was your own damn stubborn pride. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're living, sentient beings. Their rights and privileges inour society have been defined. I helped define them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll relieve you at zero three zero zero. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So far our survey team has found no deaths or injuries amongthe crew. Shuttlecraft are all operational, as are the transporters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But Iwish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. Iwould have liked the chance to have known him better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Margaret, something's very wrong here. Do you know what's goingon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If so, the question becomes how will they use that knowledge? Data, do you have any information touching this on any file? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now, with typical Ferengi logic, he's convinced that theTox Uthat belongs to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what is it you want? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From whom? Where is your documentation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long to rendezvous, Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately the results would not be available for severaldays, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, now, this is rather unusual for you to be curious aboutan away mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. You are not the first officer on this ship to havea new family member. Take care of your son. The security matters canwait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not exactly <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because they needed a liaison to communicate with humans. Theyignored every away team we sent to their ship, including yours, Doctor. You may accompany him. Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormholedidn't permanently damage the sensors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not satisfactory. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has been lost <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your help would be appreciated, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do we stop it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you're right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I got this headache long before I even knew my old ship stillexisted. Still, perhaps you're partly right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign DeSeve, you promised me a freighterwith an important cargo. The only thing here is empty space. Do youhave an explanation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare to transport these prisoners back down tothe moon's surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grand. Mister Data, when we have a complete list of all thespecimens we will be carrying, I want you and Doctor er, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you were prepared? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what is this place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It must have been. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, I'm sorry, Geordi. I'm not prepared to risk your life. Data, find another way of salvaging the Raman. I want an alternate planin two hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah! You called me Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did Wesley's flight recorder indicate that there was anythingunusual about the ship or the way it was operating? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From the surface? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was there any evidence of life? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Signal the fleet to stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're blocking the suns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many more accidents? You must leave this body. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Now, stay awake. You've got to help me. Ineed your help. All right, now listen. Your patient has lost a greatdeal of blood from multiple lacerations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Computer, continuous scan, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,vital signs. Audible readout. Begin now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to be here when he presents it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And is that why they can't conceive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You made it, Number One. Smooth ride? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: About time. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I remember. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Continue to monitor them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Romulans wish the honour of thefirst contact, let them have it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, so we are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood andon you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if youagree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available toensure that it is conducted impartially. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And his father? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The thought had occurred. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe we all know why we're here. If weadmit that, then we can move forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no. The modulation frequency is in the upper harmonicrange. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek. I'm sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will. I put a little something into your bag while you werepacking. I know you'd probably have preferreda bottle of Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As soon as the last of the colony is evacuated, I want thoseperimeter teams out of there. Is that understood? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There was a teacher of mine at the Academy who had beenconfined to a wheelchair since birth. She was a woman <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna. Anna! Anna, where are you going? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying we should give them the samples theyrequire? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to ourmutual problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're injured. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's also an arch-criminal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All it'll do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not agood idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Like you. Different in appearance, yes. But we are both livingbeings. We are born, we grow, we live and we die. In all the ways thatmatter, we are alike. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How was the Bat'leth tournament? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can assure you it was not through official channels. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and theold man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into theirbelief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure. It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, aconsort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbolanywhere else.]TROI <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. You know, Geordi, I spent the better part of my lifeexploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of newspecies. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves. Now it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thingthat I hold most dear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we hadon our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander of the Enterprise formerly assigned to the Hood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you locked on to that transmission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A few more hours. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This is my associate Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now we're supplying the devices with the energy to kill us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By the time we reach Parliament, Mister Singh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Number One, put a technical team together. Let's get these repairs underway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've managed to avoid it for the past six years, but now itwould seem my luck has run out. I can't think of anything more tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation, uninterestingfood, boring speeches. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've never seen anything like her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. First officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprisehas moved into a synchronous orbit near the southern polar region. Weawait further instructions from Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can no longer consider the DarwinStation crisis our most immediate concern, although Doctor Pulaski'scondition is inseparably linked with that emergency. Her safe returnand that of Commander Data must take priority, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is going on here, Number One? Did yougive him permission to contact me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything. Everything. I'll be in my Ready room if I'm needed. That will be all for now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us,and we ask that you now please return her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arrange to feed it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A train? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, have we any further business inthe Tanuga system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A carrier wave? Is that how he's manipulating Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think we can handle the situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: New cases? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My love is a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseththe disease. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mentioned a hospitalisation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps another time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good morning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are indeed a leader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Tasha, it's all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, that's true. I'm not Ardra. but I can create tremors justas she did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mister Data, scan. Myapologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you think it would be unwise to letEndar see Jono? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From that window, I could see an entire, er <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately,I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain WesleyCrusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The metamorph. Kamala. I've spent quite a lot of time with herthe past few days, and you're right about several things, but, Beverly,her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment and sheintends to go through with it to help her people end the war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put the asteroid on the main viewscreen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Real. The subject of this meeting is the Jaradan rendezvous. Mister Riker, will you go ahead with the briefing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advancedtechnological society could have built that object out there. Theseartefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is human. The medical scans have proved that, right, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it would be a shame for Starfleet to lose someone ofyour potential. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The saucer module should fall out of warp in two minutes. Beprepared to sweep back. Pull it in with a tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! I'm not talking about parenting. I am talking about theextraordinary consequences of creating new life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you would share them with me, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And his father? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where will you go? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That'll be all. Number One, a moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I am Locutus of Borg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. At your convenience. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I know what your word means. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, if we try to deceive one other, then we shall getnowhere. I think we all know about Professor Galen's research, andabout the computer programme composed of fragments. I'll take yoursilence as confirmation. Now, it stands to reason that none of us hasthe DNA fragments necessary to complete the programme. You were thefirst to arrive in this system. Do you have an organic sample from theplanet below? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base ofoperations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not any longer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was the diagnosis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the Enterprise. May we beof assistance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time, andstill be back in time for the rendezvous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can see them, why they can't see us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Five hundred kph. Ensign. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, we have been exemplary in our patience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Things would be different. 8.27 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was there a reason? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But Data can understand you. Use him. Let him explain yourwords. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Now end the demonstration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that the Romulans are just hoping to create adistraction. They want to keep us off balance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Ambassador T'Pel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Recommendations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that they could be branches of the same languagefamily, beginning with Iconian? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their humanrights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Brull, she's here, isn't she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did she personally form the government that so peacefully ruledthis planet for a millennium? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It must have been lying in some deep moon crater. First attackdamaged the shields. In the confusion, they hit us a second time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They can insert them into the recall loop? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, the system is clear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, clearly there has been some misunderstanding. I thinkit would be in all interests if you were to come aboard and we discussthis situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will need to be. Tomorrow I'll be addressing some of thegreatest scientific minds in the Federation. Switzer,Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland. Giants in the field of archaeology. Compared to them I'm just an enthusiastic amateur. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I give you my word. When we arrive at the Starbase, I will makeevery effort to find him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your motives, but his mother is dead. He mustlearn to live with that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kahlest? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, if you will let these people go, I'll order the Bridgeto follow your instructions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, have you any idea what has just happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Karnas, this is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you the Admiral iscritically ill. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf, what would be the impact of lowering theshields long enough to get the away team out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, I'm not your father confessor. You will receive noabsolution from me. You have brought nothing but pain and suffering tothis crew. And I'm still not entirely convinced that all this isn'tyour latest attempt at a puerile joke. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless he were forced to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: History has shown us that strength may be useless when facedwith terrorism. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, pull all relevant information with regard toStarfleet regulations on the transfer of officers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or how to kill it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If this is going to work, these people will need your strength,your guidance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's their condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you have to measure your successes and your failureswithin, not by anything I or anyone else might think. But, if it helpsyou to know this, I failed the first time. And you may not tell anyone! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All decks? Everything? The entire ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's hard to believe. Your playing is quite beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if I don't inform you there is a reason. I don't likekeeping you in the dark, but for the next few days I may not be able tobe as communicative as usual. It may make things difficult for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hardly, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we help them? Is there any way we can moderate the powertransfer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you should know, this has never been attempted before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let me know when you finished your sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size andintent. We're here alone. We must assume the worst. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forgive me if I don't act surprised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amanda, allow me to introduce, er, Q. He's er, he's anacquaintance of ours. We've er, we've known him for years. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantlyaggressive move? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She believes the Picard is a magical figure. I'm going to showher how the magic works. I'm going to bring her aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, I don't regret anything that happened last night. I hopeyou don't either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Lay in a course for the Devolin system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, really? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I didn't know. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'lladjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Before we begin, we want to see thechildren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here's what I propose. You can't stay onthe Enterprise, but I have arranged for us to rendezvous with the USSCharleston, bound for Earth. They will deliver you there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The new friends went out into the desert together, where thegreat bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught thebull by the tail. Gilgamesh struck it with his sword. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in theNeutral Zone, in the Devron System. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a nice place to visit, Number One, but I wouldn't wantto die there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there is any way of finding out whatever is out there, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years. Ventax Two must have offered her the greatest opportunity of hernefarious career. She learned of the myth of Ardra, studied it andexpertly played on your fears that your people were ready to virtuallysurrender to her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable. You had a reason. I want to know what it was. Damn it, you nearly killed a member of my crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there any other ships in the vicinity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you think that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, pleasego to Lieutenant Yar and take her down to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on the viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did this happen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I do not want to kill you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seven years! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That can't be helped. Ensign, lay in a course. Warp factoreight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you know enough about Borg programming toalter the pathways to their root command structure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sub-warp? It's several hours away then? Let's take a look atit. Enlarge to maximum. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand and I respect your people's long journey, but Ibelieve that I can help you to find a new home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Main Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, what are your plans? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,and he's not going to get one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The reception seems to be going well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll only tell that when we see his behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They started out together. It seems only fitting they shouldend up together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I would like to send down a complete away team <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my years as a Starship Captain, I've had to notify manyparents of the loss of loved ones, but never before a suicide. I wouldlike to be able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's parents some explanation ofwhat happened, to try to help them make sense of this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive ofyour species? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assemble an away team, Number One. Include whoever the Doctorrequires to assist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Drop to impulse. Take us in, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, it's going to be far more difficult where we'regoing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you wish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything we can do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, when you're finished with your duties inEngineering, report to my Ready Room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find you unavailable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put out a repeating message on all subspace channels, priorityone communiqué. Break off your pursuit immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a complication. Maybe we should ask them to join us inthis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good for you, Uncle. You know what? I once wrote a report aboutstarships when I was about your age. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've heard of that story. It's a myth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your caution. In the like vein, I want a complete,detailed manifest of everything you intend to bring on board my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, there is no question that the Romulan officer is morevaluable to us alive than dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time to impact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they still catatonic? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. Thrusters only. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't not accept that. There must be some way that we canmake the Klingons listen. If we can only convince them <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defence matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This entire mystery started when our sensors detected thatplanet. First it was class-M, now it isn't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. But say if it were undone, would she be normalagain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room four, prepare to beam aboard from inside thatshuttle anything large enough to be a humanoid adult. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unseal the doors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, one other thing. Take a look at this. Turned up during anintelligence sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, will you come with me? I'd like our Doctor toexamine you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is La Forge still down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a sense. But who knows? Our reality may be very much liketheirs. All this might be just be an elaborate simulationrunning inside a little device sitting on someone's table. Well, wehave a newborn star to study. Mister Barclay, you will keep that safe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If this hadn't worked, it would have been necessary to beamyour energy into empty space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't care. Let's just get some distance between us and thissystem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until tonight, Lutan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it appears, for reasons unknown, someone has gone to greatpains to erase all traces of this man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. That's not it. I want you to identify something forme, if you can. Captain to Transporter Room. Three to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Respond? Respond to them? What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you treat him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may be very much closer indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, I'm not convinced the boy has been abused, Doctor. I've talked with the father, and if I am any judge of character, Iwould say that he deeply cares for the boy's welfare. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. Leavethe holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm surprised that you let her come in here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They won't protect you any longer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't care for the Cardassians? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a longmission ahead of us. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine firstcommand. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me the sign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations,Wesley. We'll see that you have another chance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'msorry I had to. She was so frightened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Like a decompression tank? Let's try it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How slow? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't be a fool, Corey. Look, there are plenty of other peopleto play dom-jot with. Now just go about your business. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the distance from our present position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll accept the judgement of history. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, do you have a fix on the away team? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full about, one quarter impulse. Take us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You didn't do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a month, the metagenic agent itself breaks down anddissipates completely, leaving every city, every road, every piece ofequipment perfectly intact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe Q did the right thing for the wrong reason. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out latertonight, and then he'll want revenge. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it through, Mister Worf. Excuse me, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tempering is taken to extremes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Peace and long life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can assure you that is not the case. We're doing everythingin our power to control them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Location? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold a position five hundred kilometres from the periphery ofthe asteroid field. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait for my order, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or trusted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Penetrable? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you create the anomaly? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the Q has offered you has got to be close to immortality,Will. They're not lying about controlling space and time. We've seen itin what they can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A toast to the success of the trade conference, Reittan. I mustadmit, I had some doubts when you invited the Ferengi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo, Mister Worf. We'll haveto go after it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me when I say that we do notknow how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I saw no need. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, display the latest excavationschematics on Landris Two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey. Good man. First Officer's log, stardate 44307.6. Radiationlevels on the Enterprise continue to rise. The ventilation system hasstarted pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract theeffects. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, I have the utmost confidence in your ability toperform the impossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can take you directly through the structure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have just given the computer my command codes, thinking Iwould get control of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you think of the Enterprise D? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Besides, Tasha was a child when this woman was born. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift. When the crewmember walked in, I felt very self-conscious. It's goingto take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the twoof us together. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will your investigation affect our available power during themission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impractical and provocative. Even assuming that we have thepower to sustain such a tactic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gotcha! Now I gotcha. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But why? What possible advantage could there be to theRomulans? As this now stands, I don't think this will have any impacton our strategy. We'll continue the blockade, leave the next move tothem. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's true. But I have seen my share of death. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is different, yes. But that does not make him expendable, orany less significant. No being is so important that he can usurp therights of another. Now set him free! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good to have you back, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But thenthere must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me about Masaka. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will findanswers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerousthreat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battlereadiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board theEnterprise for a few more days? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What of Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then sending them back would be a death sentence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have nothing to prove anything here, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has his been changed as well? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take every precaution to protect the ship's vital areas. If wehaven't identified the source before the time interval, we'll leaveorbit. If you perceive any further danger, advise me immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope your journey aboard the Merrimacwill be uneventful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I'll tell them to be cautious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you telling me there's no water? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will no longer share in this pointless fantasy of yours. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's better. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you identified the source of her power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Orders which we can't even verify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception? The violence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I a prisoner here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: End this, and I will give you whatever help you need. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Credit where credit is due, madam. I can see you are a womannot only of breeding, but of wit and sagacity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You asked for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: First impressions? He's a thoughtful man. Informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By the way, where is our new doctor? Has she reported in? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the hold up, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's an old folk melody. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in acontinuous cycle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious oldman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't speak to you for months. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that's a big advantage on this mission. Very well. MisterData, will you contact Holza, arrange a meeting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to station yourself outside herquarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On our way. Picard out. We'll get to the rest of the actanother time, Data. Computer, fileprogramme and clear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How the hell are we going to get it out of there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've seen it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Last month. Just kicked in without any warning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, any explanation for this injector problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Each community would be responsible for its own. Condenserscould make the difference between watering our crops or watching themdie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Are you comfortable? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's my pleasure, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you resist? We only wish to raise quality of life forall species. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your next priority will be to retrieve any information you canabout this ship's mission. Contact the OperationsOfficer to assist you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it's time for me to go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of incentive? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: According to this we're already well past the point at which weentered the void. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't befair to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How unlikely? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Present condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I shall summon him for you. Get Riva here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level,find some way to influence their behaviour? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime,I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing todetach saucer section. so that families and the majority of the ship'scompany can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive,containing the battle bridge and main armaments, will turnback and confront the mystery that is threatening us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You look exactly like Robert when he was your age. I halfexpect to see myself as a boy come running out that door to play. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was just trying to rescue you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Denied. When we get another window in the storms. The crashsite? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you knew something, why didn't you say so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Astounding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal andrecently you've been ordering these elaborate things. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The situation is under control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, do you remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Do youremember what you were like then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I don't think I need to hear any more. That was trulyunique. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I knew that I could count on you. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, tell me a little about yourself, Crewman. I know you wereborn on Mars Colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland, you are not going to die out there. You aregoing to do exactly what I tell you. Now, take the nose of theshuttlecraft and aim it directly at Relva Seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar, when are you going to tell me who you reallyare? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Wereyou abducted from Chalna? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there nothing of Data in what I'm hearing? You see, youchose the violinists. Heifetz and Bronken have radically differentstyles, different techniques, yet you combined them successfully. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strike? I'll see what I can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course to Algeron Four, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He recognises your interest in profit. Or is that an incorrectassumption? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I neverbelieved they could be true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I care about, I care about what happens on board my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very impressive design. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm trying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jake! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm reading power fluctuations. The force field is not stable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between theMaquis ships and the Cardassians? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status of download, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have the exact location? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I cannot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, you know what to do. Take us er <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I spent many an hour there. It was my favourite spot to study. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're trying to determine what happened right now, and if thereis anything you can remember that may assist <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If your lock on the away team wavers in the slightest, beamthem back immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're having a little difficulty on cargo deck five. Yourpresence is requested. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation is setting up a weather control matrix onHekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice fornow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have confirmed that Data's discovery islife. But more than that, it is intelligent life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A very dangerous piece. Were you really going to give this tothe DaystromInstitute? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's go see your patient, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief MedicalOfficer I want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Leijten, you said that before Brevelle desertedStarbase one one two last week, he'd been ill for several days. Whatabout Mendez? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You remember Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way to Engineering. Join me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough. Answers. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, Iwant them at a staff meeting in one hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Van Doren's technique has been perfected totwo point four percent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Academy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation hasdeveloped. Mordan Four has finally gained peace after decades of civilwar <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myselfwith children. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Two's company. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets. Whatother explanation is there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to. If we don't seal that hole, this other dimensionhe's opened will rip into the fabric of the galaxy. Reality as weperceive it will not be the same. Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Put us into a close orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What configuration? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That thought has crossed our minds. Your god up there mayinsist that we obey our non-interference directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're reading a disruption of the tachyon net in your area. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we're still friends. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My orders are to maintain radio silenceuntil we've completed the mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You understand your orders? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, put up the shields until further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, of the Federation Starship, USSEnterprise. Why have you attacked my vessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, why wasn't the holodeck programmeterminated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratorymaze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how wellwe react under pressure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done. Warp engines ready on previousheading. Warp factor six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. Theywould learn about alien worlds, starships. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So the only way out is by the transporter. Or the dimensionaljump. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you picking up any readings from Melona? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only from his writings. His judgments were required reading atthe Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse on y danse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Everyone stand back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There were hostilities? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along. See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging thenodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have aresponsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Jeremy, Wesley'sfather died on a Starfleet mission when he was younger than you are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's unclear. We're running a full analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Somehow I doubt you'd find life aboard a starship suitable toyour taste. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What woman? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this how the Iconians travelled? Crossing light years aseasily as we would cross a room? Those places could be on worlds indistant sectors of the galaxy. I think the Iconians might haveout-foxed their enemies. Maybe they didn't all die in the bombardment. Some of them could have passed through this. This is what Varleyfeared. This is what he died for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And our memories of that day? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, won't you sit down? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, make certain that we're still picking up thegamma radiation pattern of the Entity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartographyisn't everybody's cup of tea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The external power is cut off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need his services. He was recommended. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's causing it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The foreign investors in the book aredescribed as flamboyantly generous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Er, er. It's not over between us, Lwaxana. You're mine and Iwill not let you go. I insist you return to my side immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lore. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. Establish parallel course. Match speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, get Mister O'Brien. Take that transportersystem apart piece by piece if you have to. Mister Worf, I want a levelthree security alert until further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, move the Enterprise out of range of theattacking vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. An ale for me, and for my officers. In fact, alesfor everyone. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, see to it that the replicators provide a blanketfor every man, woman and child before nightfall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose I have little choice. Where'sRiker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I love a mystery, Data, but this one will have to to wait untilwe deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament. Timeand tide, Lieutenant La Forge. Go to warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Everything we do tightens its grip. Let's see what we canlearn. Launch a Class one probe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A memento. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Officer, and a young woman ofremarkable courage <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree it would be difficult, but not impossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was an honour. He is a great man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, help him up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was selfish. I thought I wouldn't see you again. I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a feedback loop. Youcertainly can say. You have free will, you have a choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you and Commander Data made any progress in finding ameans of communication? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not happening. It's not enough. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for thiswitness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It wouldn't be possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But Mister Data is a member of my crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you prefer not to return to the surface? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you are who you say you are, there's no need for any ofthis. We'll gladly take you home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's more serious than that. I think the mortality fail-safemay have been circumvented. He could've killed me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After the shields fall, how long before fatal exposure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have a feeling they will choose to. Mister Crusher, setcoordinates for Starbase Lya Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know what happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For three years, since stardate 41124. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The correct procedure, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My dear Doctor, in our current position, when that starexplodes, you'll get to watch your experiment from the inside out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, proceed with Timothy as the Counsellor suggests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If your engines are functioning we'll attempt to break free. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what impact will that have on fatal exposure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, LaForge. What can you make out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would leave you defenceless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, what are their sensor readings? Is that an enemyvessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The pity is that I had to be impaled through the back before Ilearned that lesson. I started that fight with those Nausicaans. Istarted it because, because I was young and cocky. If I'd been moreresponsible in those days, I wouldn't have needed this heart, and Iwouldn't have died from a random energy surge thirty years later. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported onboard at Farpoint Station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I intruding? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, as you can see, we're back where it all started. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, I would like to analyse your sensor readings ofthe explosion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of,even if they don't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think so, really? I wonder which of them was made first? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are no technologically advanced cultures in that systemnow. But perhaps eighty seven million years ago, there were. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was the other choice? We can't fight, we can't escape, wecan't go forward. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Have Commander Riker come to my Ready room assoon as he's on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will require the cooperation of allconcerned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now you have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've lost people under my command. People who were very dear tome. But never someone I've been in love with. And when I believed thatyou were dead, I just began to shut down. I didn't want to think orfeel. I was here in my quarters, and the only thing I could focus onwas my music, and how it would never again give me any joy. Then I sawyou standing on the transporter pad and I knew that I could never againput your life in jeopardy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Didn't anyone tell you weapons aren't allowed on Risa? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year beforethat, botany. Now JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I just couldn't make him understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, if you have course and speed laid in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Have security confine all nonessentialpersonnel to their quarters. Computer, go to Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beginning braking manoeuvre. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can you tell us about him, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, if is passage narrows to less than five hundredmetres, I will abort the mission. You can charge me withinsubordination if you wish, but I'm not going to risk the Enterprisefor a salvage operation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I suggest that you return to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But if the Duras are being aided by the Romulans, itbecomes very much our concern. The Romulans have been attempting todestroy the Klingon-Federation Alliance for the past twenty years. Atthe same time, the Duras have been secretly conspiring with theRomulans. Doesn't it strike you as odd that the Duras are able to fieldsuch an overpowering force against Gowron? That they outmatch him atalmost every turn? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because of her relationship with me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you're using our files on theKhitomer massacre as evidence against Duras' father? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where did it originate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: if she hadn't lost her rank as a result of that incident atGaron Four, I think she would've made Lieutenant Commander by now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You choose not to answer? But you've already given an answer tothe inquiry, and that answer was a lie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Human or not, I want no part of you. We will deposityou at the first starbase. Let them deal with you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excessive honesty can be disastrous, particularly in acommander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now stop! I will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroythis meeting. Now please, sit down. Now, Commander Riker has asked thatyourlaboratories be inspected for stolen tissue samples, and I understandhis concern. We may have to transport all your equipment here, to theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what if there is, Mister Tholl? Shall we continue accusingone another until hostility leads to violence? Shall we allow oursuspicions to destroy us? Now, let's see if we can override this stunmechanism. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine. Destroy yourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you are hereby assigned to Q for the remainder ofhis stay. You will escort him to Mister La Forge in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can two grown men share the same childhood experiences? Itjust doesn't make any sense. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Number One, will you and the Counsellor meet our guestsin Transporter room three? And inform Chief O'Brien I will be callingon him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't I hear anything about a launching? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our communications have been blocked by the nebula, Reittan. Isthere a problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In private and off the record. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Keep me posted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions, giveyou an idea of what he expected? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How far do you think that trust goes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I also can't ignore that we have greatly outclassed theonly enemy vessel we've encountered. And that everysingle possible shred of information which might shed some light onthis situation has been conveniently eliminated. I feel as though I'vebeen handed a weapon, sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger. Well, I need some moral context to justify that action, and I don'thave it. I'm not content simply to obey orders. I need to know thatwhat I am doing is right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In truth, I simply do not have authority in this matter. I'mnot your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in mycustody, and that creates the dilemma. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enjoy yourself. You have the free time. Use it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could be certain that we'd tried everything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't recall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is enough, damn it! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Prieto, is Counsellor Troi all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must calm your people. There is no reason for panic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring us out of warp, Ensign. All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, you were recruited for one mission and if you wish tobe relieved of further duty, I can certainly arrange it. But I'd likeyou to consider remaining in Starfleet. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you and I don't regret this, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Another malfunction? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has brought a child onto my ship and on my Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, couldn't you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course, bearing one eightseven mark one zero two, one quarter impulse. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer areincompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time ofwar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker. You! You did that! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This culture will be assimilated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thirty minutes, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we can't delay any longer. Ready the tractor beam,Lieutenant Yar. Target the ship. Activate on my command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! Thank you. Captain's log, Stardate 43610.4. After completing adelivery of dicosilium to the Tanuga Four research station, our awayteam has received an update from Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts tocreate Krieger Waves, a potentially valuable new power source. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's nothing, it's superficial. What happened to Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course you do. You have an excellent record. However,here on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You will reportyour observations to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. Now. No lengthy farewells. Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever it takes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to disappoint you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamedof it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with thatline from Shakespeare. Kill all thelawyers. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jared, tell your people, if the hostages are released, I amprepared to offer Federation assistance should this, this Ardra return. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono! Jono, why do you make that noise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can beready, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have much time. He's getting more control of hisenvironment. Let's see if we can't beat Professor Moriarty by givinghim everything he wants. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Always alone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understandable, given this particular life form's novel nature. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Adjust sensors to short range. Attempt a limited positron scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Asylum? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At your earliest convenience, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove theinhabitants from Dorvan Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they a lifeform? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vulcan Security? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Mister Data. What would be the purpose of such anencasement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need your help. I must find Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll agree that this is a fairly routine mapping mission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, earlier, I was reading this book, and I had thedistinct feeling I'd read certain paragraphs before. But I assumed I'dread the book years ago and I'd forgotten. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's nothing. It's just a, just a mild headache. Thecorrect procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal the Bridge of yourfinding immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever game you want to play will have to wait untiltomorrow. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. In fact, it's amazing how little it has changed. Everythingis exactly as I remember it. The house, the hills, every tree, everybush seems untouched by the passage of time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you and Mister Worf to run high resolutionscans of this star system. Look for a ship, a base of operations,anything large enough to generate that power. Mister La Forge,accompany Doctor Clark back to the science station. See if you cantrace the origin of these tremors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course he's innocent. But as a Starfleet Captain, I can'tallow myself the luxury of yielding to my personal feelings. Theevidence warrants a trial. I'll have to allow extradition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. How long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, all too often. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean by that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I would like to have been consulted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is there anyone else on board who servedpreviously with Captain Benjamin Maxwell? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you object to giving them enough for their own immediateneeds? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought you might find this interesting, Mister Crusher. Fewhumans have ever seen an Antedean in the flesh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. I can imagine you would be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactoryexplanation of this. Director Mandl. Lieutenant Yar, would you escortthe Director to his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, andits unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we alladmire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I would like to presentthis token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty,Fourteenth Century. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. Mask out the photosphere. Magnify. Quadrant oneseven, magnification factor twelve. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're getting closer to tracing their movements. Actually, itwas Wesley who put us onto this dimensional jump of theirs. He has beenextraordinary, Beverly. He's going to make a very fine officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All set, Chief? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates. This is Nails, from Chicago. And this is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you admire him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep forthat long journey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. But regardless of this planet's immediate situation,we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimise the risk ofcontact with the inhabitants. You will go alone, Mister Worf, and Iwant to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as aBoraalan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At least you kept your wits about you out there. Don't forgetthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are submicron fractures in the metal casing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that intended as a threat? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, it would that we have found thequantum signature you are looking for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment, Lieutenant. Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, stop, everyone. Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The moment those Vulcan ships appear in the Neutral Zone, theEnterprise will move to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, what have you been doing for the past decade? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not amused, Number One. There must be some way to convinceher that it's quite impossible, without offending her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Successful? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your word has always been good enough for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data will meet you there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? I always rather had to work at that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Oh, one thing, Number One. Starfleet will benotifying Carmen Davila's family of her death and returning herpersonal effects. Would you care to enclose a letter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Fine work. We shall miss you, Mister Crusher. As you'veguessed, final entrance examination scores from Starfleet Academy havearrived. Congratulations. As soon as you have completed the oral exam,you'll be formally admitted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, hell. Go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dirgo! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you make of it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp two, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are we within sensor range? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to losenothing, either way the challenge goes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what this is all about. A lot has changed in the pastthree hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with theaccumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need forpossessions. We have grown out of our infancy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps because he's hoping to expose members of your movement. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Probably conquered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand you've been discussing alternative adversarialengagement strategy with Mister Mot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain T'Jon, we are unable to attach our tractor beam becauseof the intense solar activity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is my choice to respect the ancient rituals. Each of youwill have to prove your worthiness to lead the High Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You could say that. I've been invited to the annual StarfleetAdmiral's banquet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree to your terms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has this unique ability of instantaneously interpreting andextrapolating any verbal communication that he hears. You will find himvery useful in Sector Vega-Omicron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My compliments, Admiral Gromek. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sense anything, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the samecommitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer aproblem to someone else. Too easy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Enterprise. We are moving to intercept twoCardassian warships. Maintain your present course and speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Hitler on the move. Roosevelt pressesCongress for British aid. DiMaggio streak reaches thirty seven? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I believe he does, Data. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amanda, what Q is asking is have you ever deliberately usedyour abilities? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you reallydo have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust andloyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Surrounding the structure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, turn off that noise! Computer, what was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's good to see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And for all your protestations of friendship, your real reasonfor being here is protection. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you accompany me to the Transporter Room? Youhave the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Now this is something that I first tasted on ThelkaFour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll both go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? Mister La Forge indicated that this was not anentirely routine mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe this is some form of information exchange withwhatever is over there. At least, I hope it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stop firing! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we have to find some way of staying unfrozen. Mister LaForge, what about a subspace forcefield like the one we used on DevidiaTwo? Could something like that protect us from the effects of thetemporal fragment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you discussed this with your mother? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I'll need your help to monitor the sensor readingsduring this investigation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then this endeavour dies here, in this room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, Counsellor Troi. Will you allow me to do the introductions? This is Premier Bhavani of Barzan. Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase to warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard. We're prepared to escort you to ValoThree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Narendra Three outpost was destroyed. It is regrettablethat you did not succeed. A Federation starship rescuing a Klingonoutpost might have averted twenty years of war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I just purchased that. Why? Are you implying this has somespecial meaning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is to say that this history is any less proper than theother? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I can't ask them to go back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I did not come here to discuss your wife. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond thosefunctions and is developing a new capacity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It appears to be the same effect that you described in us. Doyou remember anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Redblock? I'll keep it in mind. Thank you for helping me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what better place to find oneself than on the streets ofone's home village. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have you been able to identify the source of theradiation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But everything started when we found the Brittain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's true, Number One. But if the transmitters and thesensors were removed and life-support installed, there would be justenough room for one person. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When you test next year, and you will test next year, do youthink your performance will improve? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And strength of character. Her loss will bedeeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us inhis place would be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you making any progress toward solvingour problems? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll go in your place. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you're new on the Enterprise. You'll have to learn toexpect the unexpected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want thembefore we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you tohelp the Emissary. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Shut down life support to those decks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He apparently has the power to heal injuries with a simpletouch. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Given the importance of the data, I think that it's worth therisk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter roomthree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause todo so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means youhave to get control of the train. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why is he unconscious? What happened to him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any information about the structure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At home. Sunday dinner. We would all sing afterward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: The Borg's entire existence was centred around acquiringcultures and technology. If that's changed, then they must have a newobjective. We have to find out what it is. Mister Worf, from thismoment on, I want to maintain a level two security alert. Post armedofficers on every deck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. We'll give you cover. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. He was a colleague of yours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hmm. You'd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy,awkward, but look at this. It's a model of simplicity. Elegant,functional. They built this craft for generations. And it worked. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're damned right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, youare allowed a complementof forty, so select whom youwill, save of course Mister Data,who will serve as myfirst officer during yourabsence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But with the disappearance of Commander Riker, wouldn't it beprudent <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, if he must, but I fail to understand how a five footandroid with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten mencan be called a child. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That grid, their wounds. Only the Q can do that. Captain's log, stardate 41591.4. Twelve minutes outfrom Quadra Sigma Three where the survivors of an underground disasterdesperately need our help. Aboard the Enterprise, First Officer WilliamT. Riker needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject far out ofmy experience. Out of any human's experience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vash, damn it, it's me! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You could use a good herbicide instead of pulling the weedswith your bare hands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did everyone know about this except me? I'll be all rightsitting here. You go off with the others. Hold onto my grandson, andwatch the damned thing go up for all the good it'll do. What is itthey're launching? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find that hard to believe. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Omicron omicron alpha yellow daystar two seven. Enable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worthy of Holmes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Notify all sections we'll be leaving this area in one hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is your status with him now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you know this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Tomalak. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: World, not galaxy. All the world's a stage. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm truly sorry, Liator, but I must have justice for my peopletoo. Transporter room, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still, it felt good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long until the Enterprise-C enters therift? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Recognise it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is your navigational system functioning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, please accompany him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only question I have, Admiral, is why you thought itnecessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages. Evenwilling to put your life at risk for it. I'll be on the Bridge,Admiral, if you want to talk further. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it you want? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see why you were so eager to find it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you climb up? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officersare deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry. Further investigation is recommended. Will, there was no furtherinvestigation. This report was classified and then it was quietlyburied. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, let's get some sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Arkaria base. Deactivate the baryon sweep. ArkariaBase, this is Captain Picard on board the Enterprise. Deactivate thebaryon sweep! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate warp shell! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not accustomed to seeing anunsatisfactory rating for one of my crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you are affected, sir, far more than you realise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's a lady, all right, and her name is Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is something the matter, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulans know that as well as we do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's another piece to of puzzle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not adream, doesn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not you too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I lied. Look, the Enterprise is scheduled to spend a weekundergoing maintenance overhaul at Starbase twelve. While there, Ipromise that I will make full use of available recreation activity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With its Lang-cycle fusion engines still intact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, Number One. Now we know whyall that is there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf's question is valid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Number One. Mister Data, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of the Federation's timetable, Number One. ProfessorGalen visited here a few days ago. And he was on his way to Indri Eightwhen he was killed. There's some connection between these two planets. I'm going to find it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Off the bridge! Both of you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you said that you found organic matter in thetemporal aperture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I trust him completely. But everyone should also realise thatthat was a necessary and legitimate security question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, go ahead, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Escort Chancellor Durken to the transporter room, Lieutenant. And assign quarters to Minister Yale. She will be remaining on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suspect is perhaps too strong a word. I'm simply trying todetermine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? I'm on my way to look in on your patient. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Just don't point that thing at me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you calculated how much further we have to go? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge! Mister La Forge, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were they pressured to return? Were they threatened with anypunishment if they didn't? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's enough, Data. Have you been able to learn more specificsabout the Manheim project? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Call me Dix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, I'm not going to play along with this. If you want tocontinue this charade, you can do it alone. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm delighted to see you. Can I get you something to drink? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've never before seen the Lieutenant so unsettled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sovereign Marouk, welcome to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Commander. Please, come in. Sit down. I find myself havinggrave concerns about our mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With a Ferengi as an associate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Think, Tallera. Two thousand years ago your people were beingconsumed by war. But when peace came to Vulcan, the resonator becameuseless. That's why it was dismantled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arrivingat the truth. Well, I hope you've learned a little wisdom along theway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And it is against Starfleet orders to accept a surrenderotherwise. Do you withdraw your surrender? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It wouldseem to suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Friendship must dare to risk, Counsellor, or it's notfriendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not a hero. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well good luck, Mister. Good luck, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time to the Solarion system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. Yes, well, that wouldn't work here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me talk to my superiors, find out what's behind this. Giveme one hour. The alternative is for us to continue firing at one other,and in such a contest, you would be at a disadvantage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sovereign, we can at least acknowledge that Chorgan appearswilling to discuss your offer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It still makes it our move. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're almost identical. How do you explain that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can give you all safe passage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What I said, DaiMon Tarr, is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would rather die as the man I was than live the life I justsaw. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Corey, I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you frommaking a serious mistake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, that won't be necessary, Mister Worf. I'm not here as yourcaptain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the HighCouncil. Your cha'DIch. We will arrive at your home world in less thana day. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seemthat we have at least one thing in common. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's all right. They're called lynars, a kind of Celtrine bat. They're harmless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm take us in to twenty millionkilometres. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There have been three major engagements inthe last two weeks, all of them won by ships loyal to the Duras family. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aaron! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up theaway team immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our shields around the Romulan scoutship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate the gesture, but I knowthat there are stronger and younger men from whom to choose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am glad you are comfortable. I've come to seek your agreementto an Ornaran request. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. What were the analytical team's findings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only if you will talk to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is our velocity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the rightthing to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was wondering if you had any feelings about the OfficerExchange Programme initiated by Starfleet Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Out of the question. That would mean breaking Taguan law. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nine point six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are the specimens ready for transfer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This biochemical stasis, does it suppress synaptic functions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take torestore the engines? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's correct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is exactly as they left it, Number One. In the bottle. Theship in the bottle. Good Lord, didn't anybody here build ships inbottles when they were boys? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, I have no reason to believe that Q islying. He claims he has orders from the Continuum. If Amanda cannotprove that she is fully Q, then he must kill her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break throughit. I want that man on this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind ofprison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that AmbassadorMauric would have any reason to detain us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, you're the last person I'd expect to argue infavour of accepting the challenge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's aware of me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've piqued my interest, Number One. Please continue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Never mind the details. Can you remove it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you like Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Use whatever resources are necessary. It appears we may haveencountered a new life form. I want to know everything about it asquickly as possible. Commander Data, supervise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Very unlikely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data launched that probe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site, youknow. It's a Federation outpost there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree, Ambassador. All of the difficult issues have beenresolved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, the Bynars have stored an enormous amount of material inour computer. We need to access it. We can't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he can put an end to all the years ofblood-letting on those planets, I think we should do everything in ourpower to assist him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, Captain. It's good to meet you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer. Store programme Picard delta onein active memory and discontinue simulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to go over to her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I feel fine. Everything seems a little smaller. RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher will monitor our responses. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Out with what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a bloodtest taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that be used tofilter out the genetic changes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trillions? I've never heard the word Tkon before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shaka indeed. What now, Captain? Will you attack me in mysleep? If I don't freeze to death first. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where do you want to go? Do you want to try to find those wholeft you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know that for a fact, Kevin? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began togrow and to evolve into something other than an automaton. He became aperson. When that happened, I felt I had no choice but to respect hisrights as an individual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been away far too long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happened, Number One? Report. Report! Report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even if it leads you into a Romulan trap. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, four billion years ago someone scattered this geneticmaterial into the primordial soup of at least nineteen differentplanets across the galaxy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Speed, warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare am away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, whom did you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Revive him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the class of these ships, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly, yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What shall it be, Tomalak? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guilty. Provisionally. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will the probe be able to transmit through that interference? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The environmental settings in these quarters have been altered. Data, over here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you communicate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need to stabilise this situation. Playfor time. I suggest we move the ship as they've asked. Agreed? Set anew heading, but take us there as slowly as you can. Ten Forward, weare moving the ship as you requested. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroyed, deliberately, after the crash. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I need to talk to a parent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No other logical solutions? But Ambassador, there are alwaysother solutions. You have said so yourself many times. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not a task that I'm looking forward to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: While on board, you are welcome to supervise the return of yourcrew, but I cannot allow Jeremiah Rossa to be returned to your custody. His true family are waiting for him on Earth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My point exactly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of questions did he have for you,Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of that, I have absolutely no doubt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: Here we are again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could we have? Perhaps in the short term. But to what end? Hold. Beverly, the Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is aphilosophy, and a very correct one. History has proved again and againthat whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilisation, nomatter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results areinvariably disastrous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you aseismologist? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Certainty? Or speculation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Karnas, this is Admiral Mark Jameson. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security team to Jefferies tube J four, deck fifteen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Hugh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counter-punchers. Thank you, Counsellor. That's quite valuable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please sit down, Mister Tarses. For the record, will you tellus your name and position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know nothing about Minos Korva. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, what the hell are you still doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have unfinished business there. I need to have a talk withthose two people. You have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I can arrange that. Data, find the Pasteur. I havesome pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilian population inthe Demilitarised Zone is in a very difficult situation, but evensympathy has to end at some point. The peace treaty isn't just a pieceof paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it couldmean hundreds of thousands of lives. Two years ago, Starfleet wouldnever have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot ofconfidence in you now. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The woman, Anya, is not what she appears tobe. She is an allasomorph. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A little time together? How much? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but Ican offer you assistance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. But I just want you to know I'm available if youshould change your mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But not today. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Irrational? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for the new coordinates, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Intercept. Warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We know from our own experience that our shields will protectus. So long as we're in no danger, I will make every effort tocommunicate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar, how do you intend to achieve this rest that youso desire? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. Mister Worf,channel all available power to the structural integrity fields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attacked it ? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cat food? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your strategy failed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, we are prepared to defend the life of the alien. Screen off. Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The uniform. It's totally inappropriate. I should have changed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't say anything about being thirsty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We reach Nahmi Four in twenty two hours. We'll want alltransporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic acrossthe board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would suggest you ask your friend the Cardassian liaison,Admiral. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassiansstaged it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would give me a chance to take up Doctor Langford's offerand accompany her to the ruins on Suvin Four. But to leave theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'll operate the transporter controls myself. If she'sgoing to be consigned to oblivion, then <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And whatever happens down there, your prime responsibility isto the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Run a localised subspace scan to look for anything else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, the Homeric Hymns. One of the root metaphors of our ownculture. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. But not the second time. Now, you'll do me the courtesy ofjoining us at dinner. I have to disappoint an old friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agreewith you. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Disengage the tachyon pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've had some unpleasant surprises. Will, this isn't a goodidea. Baran might grow suspicious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you say the couple is incapable of sustainingthemselves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who's manning the command post? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beam them straight to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, incomingwounded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar. We'll be approaching the southern polar regionthat you requested in a few minutes. I need to give additionalinstructions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Data, I want you and Geordi to return for more carefulinspection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, Federation Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, ask them to identify themselves and match ourorbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of thisworld? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must miss him very much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly ofyou. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down toAltair Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage thetachyon pulse immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the Ambassador is not well. Will you please attend tohim in his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is the crew's spirit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, ma'am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were right, Tallera. The resonator cannot be stopped byphasers and shields, but it can be defeated by peace. Captain's log, stardate 47169.2. Security MinisterSatok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest ofthe isolationists. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have, actually. I've thought about it for a long time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm curious about how this rare form of communication cameabout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sound general quarters. Clear corridors ofall non-essential personnel. I don't want him taking any hostages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await yourfurther instructions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As it was intended. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem you two have a lot to discuss. If you'll excuseme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From thetop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. No. How can I accept this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lutan is a fortunate man. You've met Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You let their emotion sway you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it would be only fair. But let's allow her the moment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, step away from her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're destroying yourself and anyone who is foolish enoughto listen to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Search theoretical. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The hum has gone too. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I had gone with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Triolic waves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was my answer, computer? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Are they truly incomprehensible? In my experience,communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like tobelieve these are qualities we have in sufficient measure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet the Federation and the Cardassians have struggled toohard for peace to abandon it so easily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of what nature? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's imperative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold your positions. Take no action. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still, there was a considerable loss of life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you bring her out of it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, initiate a level two security alert on all decksuntil further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do we know about the cause of these wars? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me posted, Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is necessary. You're in great danger. A warship hasreturned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, but I should prepare for the ceremony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Probably getting into more trouble than Wesley, I can assureyou. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf, relay the prefix codes of the Phoenixto the Cardassian warship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mirasta said it would be a mistake to discuss this with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The play? A Midsummer Night's Dream. We have performed inLondon, Paris, Milan. Milan. To sold out houses. I assure you, you willhave the rent, in full, with a bonus. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope that by the end of this matter, you will no longer lookat me as an adversary. My family. Well, our roots in Western Europe goback to the time of Charlemagne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need you on the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you really think using their identities would gain oursympathy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Disengage all engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressiveaccomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're our guests, Mister Worf. I don't want them to feel likeprisoners. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Another white dwarf star. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps there's a residue of humanity in Q after all. Ensign,en Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My answer is still no. My lecture will have to stand on itsown. Now, will you please leave my ship. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very little. It was thought to be uninhabited until theseemissions were detected. Starfleet believes that the Cardassians mayhave a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet surface. Our orders are to penetrate this Celtris Three installation anddetermine if the Cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope that's not a stutter. I don't know how long a delaythere will be between the launch and the detonation. I'll hold keyingthe launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until theEnterprise reappears? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf acknowledge. Can you hear me, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must select an officer to replace Data at Ops. Recommendations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's why they're asking for you. Not for your militaryproficiency, but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Harry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full stop. Hold this position again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, try to reestablish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, CaptainScott. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting he was conscious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could this planet have escaped that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not, I think, today, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said modern rite. How was the ritual performed in the past? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging theFederation into a Klingon civil war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on theBridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The installation should be about threehundred metres this way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I promise you that when I leave this house I will never setfoot in it again. But the Enterprise will remain in orbit over theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands, brace for impact! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You made a mistake twelve years ago, but your service sincethen has earned you a great deal of respect, but this incident may costyou some of that respect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to see him. Here. Now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data, that is a natural assumption. Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I doubt it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have committed acts of aggression against the UnitedFederation of Planets. If you do not withdraw immediately <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And broken your leg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whenever I look at you now, I won't see a powerful Cardassianwarrior. I will see a six year old boy who is powerless to protecthimself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the twenty fourth century. Material needs no longerexist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, please, feel free to volunteer any important information. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign Laren, please have a seat. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, tell me. How much time did Data andGraves spend together? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here we go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know what it is. Don't sedate him. Let him be. Please. Lethim to remain conscious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Stand by phasers. Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So that you can wake with the dawn and begin the hunt again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're authorised to do so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to see that contract. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you still unable to recall anything about your past? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last twodays here on this starship, not on Boraal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything we'veever seen before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To all Maquis ships. Call off your attack or we will be forcedto engage you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When you say it wants you, do you mean it'sstill you, only you, and not me. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you endangered this vessel in which we all travel. Younearly killed a crewmember. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ridiculous. Did you do your best? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf is my Chief of Security and my tacticalofficer. This matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon. Doctor Timicin, allow me to present LwaxanaTroi of Betazed. She's also a guest on board, and <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you were ordered to rendezvous with the fleetat Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's their offensive potential? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just a few moments. You saw the Admiral on the Enterprise whenhe was en route to Mordan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if the doors are closed, then the backwash from the rocketswill spill into the power grids and there'll be an overload. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remembrance and regrets, they too are a part of friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If someone homed onto the subspace signals created by ourmodified signal array, could we do the same to them? Track the tetryonemissions to their universe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, organise it into brief answers to my questions. We havevery little time. Do they accept our presence at this planet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prophecies? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, I can't, Mister <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now we know there's someone out there and they're asking forhelp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, there is no dignity in this suicide. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation. Your company is much appreciated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understand, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. And the mission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Expanding? I thought that time was suspended on this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's alright, Counsellor. Perhaps there's nothing out there tosense. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything I can do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Her name was Corlina. I'd arranged to take her out today, andthen she discovered that I had already made a second date with anotherwoman called, er, Penny, and Corlina was naturally upset. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll be waiting here to pick you up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Speculate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we just get this over with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, Mister Crusher, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, Gamma Tauri Four is recognised by allcivilised members of <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign T'Su, situation report. T'SU <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Allright, let's focus their attention. Mister Worf, fire phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, they're alive now. We're going to have to treat them asliving human beings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He knows. We all know. Will he live? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, You must return to theEnterprise immediately. Counsellor Troi is dying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever itis you're doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Noted, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you know all this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I believe we will postpone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Legends like that are the spice of the universe, Mister Data,because they have a way of sometimes coming true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, move us closer. Ten million kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is the wave affecting our warp drive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are no local authorities. The government is splintered. It seems that there are various factions vying for power. They'redesperate for weapons or technology of any kind. Apparently, some ofthe factions have resorted to torture to gather their information. Well, a Starfleet research team would be a prime target. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did it work? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the status of the enginereplacement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You say you are true evil? Shall I tell youwhat true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender ourfreedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did everyone get out in time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, the Master of Tarquin Hill designed ceramic objects thatwere three hundred years ahead of their time. All we know of him is thework. His name has never been discovered. This object is over twelvethousand years old. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's probably still there with the others. I wouldn'tworry. We need to regain control of the ship. Options? RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is Odan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beamhim aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Talk to him, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems he built that bridge. I may be forced to tear it down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but where is this place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was fear. Fear of seeing you, losing my resolve. Fear ofstaying, losing myself. Fear that neither of these choices was right,and that, and that either would have <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then the Sheliak must agree to extend our deadline. They planto settle Tau Cygna Five two days from now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, chart a course for it immediately. Warp seven. And there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of thisdiversion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mindis set. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's that important to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Steady on that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my monitor, Lieutenant. Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's your evidence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I have no choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With reason. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. I wish I could excuse myself as well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Adjust course to intercept. Warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, over here! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain speaking. Alldecks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attemptto warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre yourthoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called theTraveller. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, this isn't what I wantedat all. It's much to violent. I'm here to relax, not to dodge bullets. Reconfigure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You want to fight with me? Is that it? A challenge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? You've made a mistake. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You might have taken the simple precaution of locking the door. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah'sstandards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read yourlast novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, butfor the rest I <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumedby your own pain. Believing your own lies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you wish, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the condition of the alien ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And how are you, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I heard that. They were not words exactly. A sudden sense offear. A sense of fear of heights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Doctor, keep us informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I thought you'd be comfortable here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is regrettable. A lot more people are going to die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, there is a Klingon vessel in the area. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This has nothing to do with ship's business, Number One. Suffice it to say, it is strictly a matter of image. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Instruct Engineering to proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of cargo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And so the upshot is that we'll be close enough for you to slipaway for a few days and see Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Mister Burke, will you handle that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admit what, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where are we going? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memorybegins to fail. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They have been monitoring me on my communicator, executing aprearrangedprogramme on her ship's computer, a fairlyingenious combination of force-field projection, holography andtransporter effects. Ardra controls her magic literally bythe blink of an eye. Centuries old technology. An implant which permitsthe movements of her eye to choose and activate each illusion. Ardra once told us that she is known by many names. Well, at least inthat she was being honest. Her crew has admitted that she is known bytwenty three aliases in this sector alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative. Nothing goes out without specific orders from me. Hopefully the delay will be minimal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed tohappen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, I think you were right after all. I think I did comeback so that you could help me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A life form? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Small talk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Geordi. Let me know if you <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As simple as that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hardly ever recall dreams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One further thing. A special favour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I want a tactical projection of possible future Romulandeployments along the Neutral Zone. Access all Federation records onthe subject and report to my Ready Room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, MisterData. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Worf. Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How did this happen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see no reason to continue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You heard me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, to whom am I speaking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain theseincredible explosions of velocity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Garrett. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A narrow vision. You will become one with the Borg. You willall become one with the Borg. The android, Data. Primitive artificialorganism. You will be obsolete in the new order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he is the creature of conscience I believe him to be, he hassomeone to help first. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened to the test ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well. a strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, lock onto that transponder signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Premier. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is all very interesting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Collect your samples, Mister La Forge. We'll proceedwith caution. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Batai? JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I insist we do whatever we can todiscourage the perception of this new android as a child. It is not achild. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Ambassador. Number One, set a course one three zero marktwo four six, warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why must this One destroy biological organisms? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker, put us nose to nose with the Sheliak ship. Anymove she makes, match it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obstructing him? Then it's not yet certain. He's not yetcommitted. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It wasn't this bad. But it's getting worse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have your orders, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you don't intend to back off that position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us in a little closer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This transmitter module has been totally destroyed. How couldthat happen? It looks as though it's been hit by a phaser blast. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it's just that for a moment you sounded more like WillRiker. We have received information that the new host will arrive ineighteen hours. Will you be all right until then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can I find Korgano? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I've just been recollecting the arrival of a newFirst Officer on board the Enterprise, and a manual docking confidentlyachieved. I may have been somewhat miserly in my congratulations then,so let me make up for it now. The Captain of the Starship Ares isretiring. Congratulations. You've been selected as his replacement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As do I. I would be willing to consider releasing Lal and Datato you so that he may continue his work with her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation ofour treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Disconnect the power-transfer beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll send an away team, Prime Minister. Picard out. CounsellorTroi, Commander Data, Mister Worf, you will accompany me to the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security to Captain's quarters immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: at warp factor eight? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do your best, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Married? She's getting married? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has astarship, he has technology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Compliments, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not my life. I know that much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She knows exactly what she's doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will not survive ours. Shall we die together? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, I urge you once more to reconsider. The Enterprisecan accommodate a Romulan delegation without sacrificing our securityor <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, identify. What is a QE Two? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Voval. Voval, try not to move. You may have a concussion. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise, do you read me? Too muchinterference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have we any idea what came through the rupture before we wereable to shut it down? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Robert, why didn't you inform us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother forthe fine Counsellor she <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't get out of character, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, no. I've come here to prevail upon your intelligenceand your insight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, monitor your speed exactly. When ithits point zero two zero, I want you to restart the engine <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If my crew say there was no sabotage, then you can be surethere was none. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're in orbit around Vandor now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There goes the other shoe. They know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is Commander Riker alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much longer till we can access their logs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. I suggest a steady pace, not a brisk one. We need toration our energy. Try breathing through your nose. That way it willhelp to prevent dehydration. I'll lead. Captain Dirgo, will you bringup the rear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I do appreciate your caution. I share it. Bringhis vessel into the shuttlebay. Place it under guard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What help? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi, will you report to the guest lounge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sickbay. Not good is a galactic understatement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us out of here, maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, any analysis of those bolts of light it emits? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Like Fermat's theorem, it's a puzzle we may never solve. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are we ready, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arming these people is a violation of everything that theFederation stands for. Even you cannot be blind to that. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, plot a course for Starbase two sixty, warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, whatever it is we're looking for, it seems we've foundit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there others like you there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No wonder it attacked us. It was about to give birth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, that will be just fine. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What must I do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May we turn on the viewer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why did you come to Tagus Three? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every lifeform had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm lookingforward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it's your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well. If you'll come with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When least expected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. That's good. You see, my people once lived in caves. Andthen we learned to build huts and, in time, to build ships like thisone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Torture has never been a reliable means of extractinginformation. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. Onewonders that it's still practiced. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of problem, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, exit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Their condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sometimes, Number One, you just have to bow to the absurd. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, Ensign Crusher, set course for the Epsilon Sector, warpfive. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona, you are free to socialise with the members of mycrew. I'm talking about a man named Debin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't recall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What you're suggesting <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A risk we have to take. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us onthis heading. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to Bridge. Situation report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll discuss it. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of chance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need someone to read a part. You're just in time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis andcancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time that I wasgoing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The warbird has vanished as well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is my security chief! Get me Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Replicators and stabilisers. Two totally unrelated systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to manual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This may not be good medicine, but for Worf, it may be his only choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protectoroutdoors? You do? Good boy. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There will be no interference from us, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Especially under these circumstances. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is everyone all right? RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Esoqq, how long can you go without food? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death and howDoctor Crusher brought her back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You admit the truth and yet expect him to accept punishment? What does this say of an Empire who holds honour so dear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're right about this then perhaps we can escape the loopby avoiding the collision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell is she doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Klingons? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He looks almost proto-human. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Go to Yellow Alert. Transmit friendly greetings,all languages, all frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry if you're upset. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When we arrive at the pulsar, I shall require everyone attheir best. I know that I can rely on both of you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know exactly what I mean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You areconsidering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,you may lose. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No one has been hurt. You have achieved your objective. Youhave your planet back in order. We have our ship. Well, it's been sometime since I had the conn. But not to worry, Number One, you're in goodhands. Starbase 74, warp two. Engage. Everything's under control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of activity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A slight navigational error? Nearly half a light year past theNeutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about my quarters? More intimate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives. It depletedyour food supplies, left your population weakened and miserable and yetyou risk another war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Phillipa. Dinner? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously you feel it's something we should look at morecarefully. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. It's a classified matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site onLandris Two. Could you put it through to my Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Doctor. Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have these intense feelings of fear and panic. I feel as if Iwere being watched. I can't explain it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, please, Mister will do fine. Well, the overallconfiguration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. The surface ornamentation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's our position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Hera? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I consider this time well spent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How interesting. And you  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, something has obviously gone wrong with your circuitry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing forsome dreaded recital. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Yes, what is it, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want those codes that Manheim gave Mister Data rechecked andthen checked again. No one is beaming down to Vandor unless we can bereasonably sure they can get through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Position report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until theFerengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that hedeceived you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll go through the gate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, it appears that severing the powertransfer has not only prevented the core breach, but has also restored <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid we're going to have to evacuate your people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What would it be like, Counsellor? No ship, nobulky spacesuit. Just to live between the stars, have the entire galaxyas a home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command, and askStarbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was, I was thinking I, I might be imposing. I could veryeasily stay in the village. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. Captain's log, supplemental. The inorganic lifeform from Velara Three has apparently taken over our Medical Lab. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are you feeling all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on theEnterprise. What unit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must have some idea how things havechanged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand what you've done here, Q, but I think the lessoncould have been learned without the loss of eighteen members of my crew. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes sleep. Sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maques, is it possible that your telepathic communications withMrs Troi harmed her in some way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, they're already underway. I have an announcement for theentire Bridge. As many of you suspected, when our ship passed throughthe edge of this, it accidentally carried away a sentient being. Muchlike these energy patterns we're seeing here. A terrifying experiencefor anyintelligent being. As if a great claw had reached down and scooped oneof you from your home world. Drawn into the energy circuits of thisvessel, it found its way to you, Worf. Frantic at being carried fromits home world, and recognising you as sentient beings, it pleaded forhelp, but in ways youcouldn't understand. Desperately going from person to person, and thendiscovering the computer intelligence in this ship's memory circuits. Oh, simplistic intelligence, but it furnished it enough to slow thisEnterprise thing that had captured it. And it very much regrets theaccidental death of Engineer Singh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Starship Essex vanished over two hundred years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what happened down there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep an eye on it. Mister Worf, any luck? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Such as my reporting this incident to your superiors who mayquestion your competency asDaiMon? I will think about it. Screen off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. That would be prudent. Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, Data, but that takes away none of thewonder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I couldn't sleep either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I don't know who or what you are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm withtheir disruptors. They've sealed us in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are going to make another attempt shortly. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A cloaking device? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The inertial dampers shouldn't fail without kicking in theautomatic bypass. I want to know what went wrong. Analysis in thirtyminutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate that, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, you might. But that does not alter your duty to me and tothis ship. Now, do you know how to formulate a premise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, Data, I know about the Orient Express. But what is itdoing on Prospero's Island? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember. I was so nervous I was afraid that I would dropher. Now look at the little lady. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment,Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm asking that you keep an eye on your son during all of this,Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Do you read me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were alltogether on the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Walker! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When his family was killed, how did he take it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rest assured we shall not leave until he is located. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hate it when you do that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm that glad you approve. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could there have had some sort of malfunction? A reactor corebreach? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter howstrange they may seem to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would be acceptable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sleep, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that it's time I met Commander Sela. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want toconfront him, settle this matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we will leave them be. I'll order warning beacons placedin orbit and on the surface. Hopefully, no one else will have to gothrough what you did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From where you are, can you determinewhat's happening on the Romulan Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sickbay, this is Picard. Have an emergency medical team meet meoutside Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Someone invented a hut. Someone invented a bow, who taughtothers, who taught their children, who built a stronger hut, built abetter bow, who taught their children. Now, Nuria, suppose one of yourcave dwelling ancestors could see you as you are today. What would shethink? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll have an answer shortly. Lock on tractor beam, Mister LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, end programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to try to communicate with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's no concern, Number One. It's here and it's precisely onschedule. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you must mean it's empty of matter. There's alwayssome energy form at work. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase power to the impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see nothing so bitter about that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, the Uthat belongs to your time, not mine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't use the replicator? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they'reno longer at war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what are these beings trying to tell us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is responsible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are aboard the Enterprise, Captain. One seven oh one D. Youhave come twenty two years into the future. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A wormhole? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, Iwas remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A manoeuvre wasbeing made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Canyou smell it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that is your wish, we will respect it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And look what we've done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Main Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's because there is no a wormhole. There never was. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection. There is no conclusive evidence that this woman evervisited the planet a thousand years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long will it take to determine the exactlocation of the Pegasus? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is an understatement, Number One. The last time I sawCommander Flaherty, he spoke forty languages. As I recall, among themore exotic were Romulan, Klingon, Giamon, Stroyerian. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Academy must make you wait, that's true. But, when I reviewyour service to this ship, your crewmates, I cannot in all consciencemake you wait for the Academy. You see, Wesley, in my eyes you're anacting ensign in title only. I hereby grant you field promotion to fullEnsign, with all the commensurate responsibilities and privileges ofthat rank. Congratulations. You're dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got onit. Conference evaluation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Food and water? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In fact, the programme is continuing even now inside that cube. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you any idea how this happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you find me some way to communicate with thesethings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risklosing you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't found anything,including peace, which is the only thing I'm looking for. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now look, this is a simple ceremonial greeting, nothing more. All right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Easy, we don't want to alarm or provoke it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, see if you can move us away from thedisturbance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Failed? Voval, what is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're so wrong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resistance is futile. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is Captain Picard. Return all command functionsto the stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we have to find some way out of here. Beginscanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. I think we must not lose sight of the fact thatwe're talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank. Even though she may appear somewhat eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must betreated with the appropriate respect. Is that understood? Picard toPulaski. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Stay as long as you wish. No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goss has fired a missile at the wormhole. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This leader of theirs, Conor, he seems to be a reasonable man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cease Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're to be presented with evidence today. We'll need your helpin analysing it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems we are becoming detectives, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fully enlarge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that's what I'm going to have to do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member ofyour away team. I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lead the security team, and, Lieutenant, you understand withwhom you are dealing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The lights stay on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seemsour Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of hercompletely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,if you wouldn't mind telling me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How will these resonators destroy the crystals? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, respectfully. I would appreciate consulting rights onthe assignment of a new officer, especially one with the record of RoLaren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Change them? You mean change the past? Q, even if you have beenable to bring me back in time somehow, surely you must realise that anyalteration in this timeline will have a profound impact on the future. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you reading any of this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, what are you doing now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when did I learn to play it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now we now have a reasonable hypothesis asto whom. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have they crossed the border? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? I'll be glad to do when I'm free. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earthrepresented civilisation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no. I want to go over this again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm beaming you up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, Mister Data. I believe that if we find thesource of those tetryon emissions, we'll find the missing crewmembers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not this time, Will. I want you on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He'll never lose that respect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we must have something in common. We communicate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to worksomething out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I doubt the warp bubble could alter computer records, or erasememories. Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's our only workingtheory for now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long until we reach transporter range? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You had no claim to that vessel. It was ours to destroy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what would happen if the Enterprise C were to fly backthrough it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently, the Yridians knew more about the Professor's workthan we do. They may have known what these numbers mean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, explain this procedure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not true. I was interested. And I was proud that my familywere helping to preserve the traditions. I just didn't feel bound bythose traditions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, do you copy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your mind isdifferent, it's not the same as <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection, Your Honour, I want this read. All of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Among them Connor and Moira Rossa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it remains to see if he has the support of the law. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the case of this group, it apparently worked. Mister Data,will you report to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, set course for the Kaleb sector, warp factoreight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yet at one time you found something very appealing about it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that is one possible definition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems that the exemplary nature ofyour work has caught the attention of Starfleet Command. In fact,someone is coming on board just to see the engine modifications you'vemade. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And were they? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Terms accepted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What lights? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. We look forward to seeing you, Admiral. Enterpriseout. Quinn wants to see us alone. At least we know he's still on ourside. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, on the starship Enterprise, no one is alone. No one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One quarter impulse, engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, yourplanet has been conquered six times! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck nine. Officers' quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You insisted I look into her situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then Counsellor Troi is still alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase to warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is the boy now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll just have to trust me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, the Ansata separatists have been trying forgenerations to freed themselves from the rule of the eastern continent. If they can get the government just to acknowledge their demands, thenkidnapping your mother will have served its purpose. I think that maybe what they're after, but it may not. Frankly, Wesley, I don't care. My only concern is to get your mother back. Very shortly, we shall beleaving to have a meeting with the authorities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because your presence gives me potential access to a kind ofinformation that I've never had available to me before, and if I am tore-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possibleasset. It would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland, I assume you can manoeuvre it home? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, they are not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, will you escort Miss Rogers to her quarters? I needto discuss the Tagran's medical needs with Doctor Crusher. And MissRogers? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With respect, Admiral, I would point out no one else has heardor considered Karnas's demands. The Federation might view themdifferently if they knew what they were. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If it works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can returnlater. If it doesn't <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to compile the data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dad! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You do this of your own accord? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the two of you are very well acquainted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely, Captain, you have regulations to take care of suchan eventuality. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You acted in good conscience, Doctor. I don't see what else youcould have done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lasers can't even penetrate our navigation shields. Don't theyknow that? RIKER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I doubt it. There'd be nothing to gain. It's more likely thatthey would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not half as much as this damn headache. Take over, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Disengage the cloaking device, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying you believe it to be hostile? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you located the science team, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have no idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it stable enough for an away team? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Aaaaardklaxon leeeeesss blag blan ar'nik ka'nik. Aaaaard krasulaaa. Rasssstrassss trasulaaaah. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Tallera, what are these artefacts we've beencollecting? I know that they are Vulcan in origin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The shoot-out between the bellboy and Mickey D. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there something more, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminalbehaviour is as unacceptable in the twenty fourth century as it was inthe nineteenth. And much harder to get away with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what's going on? We've lost primary helm control on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At ease, Cadet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The exocomps are siphoning power from the core. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I regret that I gave it up. It used to please my mother. But I didn't like performing in front of an audience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our Data has said the same thing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bitvague from the moment just before you abandoned ship. Is there anythingthat you can add to the official account? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it would be better if you stayed on board theEnterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will goto Starfleet Command. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: My duties in that regard are finished. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, have you been able to determine the cause of thewarp breach? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know it's hard to accept, but even the best <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're all missing some of the fragments, not necessarily thesame ones. Unless we combine the ones we have, we will never learn thesecret of theprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, whether he wants us or not. DirectorMandl, unless you're absolutely refusing permission for us to land atyour station, prepare to receive our away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When can you begin the process? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's clear that he's frightened, but that's hardly anindication <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Why did I invite you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, I'm your cha'DIch. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, where is Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Advise all personnel on deck thirty eight to stay out of thecargo bays. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold your ground, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might create a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You heard the order, Mister Lynch. Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. You read me well enough to sense how I feel about you andwhat you do on this ship. But I just wanted to say the words. Thankyou. Well done. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thee and me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at MisterData's dreams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's quite right. And as I'm supposed to be dead, I'll go andget some sleep. And, Mister Data, I suggest that you escort CommanderRiker to the brig. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. Youare not to enter Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you can explain why his craft is threatening toattack us unless I give him custody of you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you believe I am all-powerful, then you cannot hurt me. If,however, I am telling the truth and I am mortal, you will kill me. Butif the only proof you will believe is my death, then shoot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, is there any point to all this? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're going to deny us travel through space? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching theValo system on the outskirts of Cardassian territory, where manyBajorans have resettled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire the photons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you mean? Do they intend to destroy it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your service honours us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, as this is a female dominated society, you mightwish to make the initial contact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister Worf! Now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, it came in handy. I only wish I'd had the opportunityto use it on a horse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Later. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going to contact Starfleet Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat yourmessage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Her belly may be full, but her spirit will be empty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, find out everything you canabout the destruction of the Khitomer outpost. Cross reference withRomulan tactics and strategic information on the region, and requestaccess to the Klingon central information net. Computer, presentationoverview of Klingon custom and law pertaining to familialaccountability. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But, your honour! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's just get that uncaught, shall we? There's everyindication he's served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratingsaboard the Zhukov were satisfactory. In fact I recall Captain Gleasonspeaking quite highly of him before his transfer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, quickly. If the changes in Doctor Pulaski's werereversed, would it be possible <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using thenatural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial rightnow. We need to find out who we are and well, what we're doing outhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nella. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Worf. Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I to understand the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, if it is me you're investigating,ask me directly what it is you want to know. And please tell me exactlywhat is going on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In case we decide to surrender to them, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons havetaken over the Romulan Empire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are not to blame. What happened appears to have been thework of onedesperate man. It may not reflect the feelings of the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have two choices. Either way, one version of history oranother will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one. Now who is to say which is better? What I do know is here, today, oneway, millions of lives could be saved. Nowisn't that incentive enough? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Number One. Or should I say, John Little. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, return to the intermittent signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they were brought here by whoever created thatmake-believe world down there. It's possible they didn't know howfragile the humans aboard actually were. Only one of them survived. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No thank you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. Computer locate Tam Elbrun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Advise him to set his coordinates for the Delta Quadrant. Hemay run into them in eighty years or so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it be Lore? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was wondering, Mister La Forge. What's our engineefficiency status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro has educated me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, now that Wesley's safe, go to Sickbay at once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the last thing you do remember? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course we did. But in the end we may have proved just asdangerous to that colony as any core fragment could ever have been. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, that would take several hours. We don't have thetime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you still know how to work it. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The massacres in the Norkan outposts, for example. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now. Reconsider your decision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll do all that we can to help them but in the meantime Iwant them kept under surveillance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a ruse, designed to throw us off the track. Look at theclues. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, the computer clock, thetransporter trace. All indicate the existence of a missing day. Lieutenant Worf's broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awakeand aware for that day, possibly in a struggle for our lives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. All right, let's proceed on the premise that what we havejust seen happened, and that in less than four hours from now, theEnterprise will be destroyed, and somehow, although this isunfathomable, I and I alone escape. Discussion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we withdraw, what do you intend to do with the Bajoranvessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. Welcome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you made any progress, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not adrift. The Enterprise is a starship, capable oftravelling through space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: According to Starfleet regulations, that would be my onlycourse of action. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm not doingyou a favour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak withhim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's one in the Fleet museum, but then of course, this isyour Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And she wasn't ninety three years old. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will the Cardassians cooperate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know a way of acquiring some discreet transport. Mister Worf,set a course for Torman Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security to deck six, section twenty five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't thinkyou'll find one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the Krayton. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you know I like to keep youwell informed as to the nature of our missions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, shut down all computer access to Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, let's take a closer look. Perhaps we can findsomething that will give us a more positive identification. Helm, takeus through the debris field, ahead slow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's going on, Q? What's your real purpose here? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, itsclockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter,energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence mustbe more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyondEuclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existenceis part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many on board? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you see that, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is this possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may be able to assist you in recreating the events. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Course one four eight. Correction, course one seven zero markzero one four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are moving to intercept. Maintain your course and power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a little out of their territory. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. And please add that if he is unable to provide a ship,then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would bewilling to help me. And then, they would have our gratitude. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, please don't let me keep up from doing your duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Now, keep singing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. We'll begin transporting the survivors on board immediately. Bridge out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've never needed a crew before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We areready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess whileI review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about theexplosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuingyour investigations? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lore. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew havereturned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site onDevidia Two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the inverted T means to hold the Z. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Turn them over to Quinteros. There will be a hearing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank youfor your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the world of fact, probably not. However, in literature,criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise. The immortal SherlockHolmes would have an interesting view of our mystery, I believe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Data. Though I don't think you got CommanderRiker's hair quite right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Defector? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your service to this ship has been exemplary. I don't want tolose you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Number One, is the entire crew aware of this littlescheme to send me off on holiday? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let's try it. Mister La Forge, I want you to monitorthe situation very carefully, and keep an open comm. link with theHolodeck so as to be apprised of any problems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, I understand that your homeworld hassome of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Isthere any place in particular that you would recommend I visit whileI'm there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I require a cloaked vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Noted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Please get to the point. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuses, Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's comparing the Enterprise to a cruise ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shall we go again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have they done to my ship now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we could get to the root command, we could introduce aninvasive programming sequence through its biochip system and thenreturn it to the hive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, target phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are thepeople of Minos? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Make whatever arrangements you think areappropriate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, estimated arrival time at the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are asking me to step down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. So she advised this council? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll be at the rendezvous on schedule, don't worry. Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Korris. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bok! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None, Lieutenant. None at all. Captain's log, supplemental. Since the newborn hasattached itself to the hull, it has been making greater and greaterdemands on the ship's energy, but we have been able to stabilise ourpower systems temporarily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cadet Haro. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of thefield? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. Meet me inTransporter room three. Mister La Forge, you have command of theBridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your mother? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And our attacker fired on the wrong one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, I'll go and get some rest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, neither have I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready to beam down to the vessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, she appears to be your mother, but she is not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The preliminaries are over. All we need do now is escort theRomulan Ambassador to the final session. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I also once asked you if you were doing this of your ownaccord. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, you have command until further notice. Please, make the proper ship's log entries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No doubt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I have business there. I shall accompany you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by to fire torpedoes on my command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called theStargazer. It was an overworked, underpowered vessel, always on theverge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable sense, myEnterprise is far superior. But there are times when I would givealmost anything to command the Stargazer again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Ah, Number One. Look at this. Ever since we left the LimaSierra system, I have been puzzling over how the third planet couldmaintain such an orbit, when it is theoretically impossible. Butconsider this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, to transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respectedmember of my crew, could be accused of a capital crime. Your actions inthis matter will reflect on this ship and on the Federation. Therefore,it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your sidewhile you make your challenge. I'm sure you would do no less for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell us what you need, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is my sworn duty to protect you. The Enterprise will remainin orbit around Rana Four as long as the two of you are alive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Advise them of our status, Mister Worf. Go. Replicate what youneed, and see that the devices are properly distributed. Not forgetting Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's where it will be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish, you can stay on board while we wait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Q, you did not. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And then what you most feared, happened. Rishon went to fightwith the colonists, and died with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number fourseven eight B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Believe me, Beverly, there was only one decision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A defect that you hadn't noticed before? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warn them we'll return fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How does this resignation threaten the ship and its crew in anyway? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a pity you didn't try using the holodeck instead ofsetting fire to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge, abort immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This tranquilliser should keep himunconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into whatappears to be one of the earlier hominids. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. TheEnterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go,they won't attack you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I am not dead. Because I refuse to believe that theafterlife is run by you. The universe is not so badly designed. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Liko! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, be sure we get tricorder images of their tacticaldisplay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is correct, Mister La Forge. Warp factor eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An algorithm? Are you saying that these fragments areelements in some kind of computerprogramme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Additional information. The number ofcolonists at the site is five hundred and four. Are you prepared forthat many, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? Whatabout the lives that have already been lost? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it you want? We mean you no harm. Do you understand me? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The breach never happens. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need toneutralise the homing signal <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I suggest a secured channel, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mute it, Mister Data. With that storm activity down there, itisn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet that wehave solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find it hard to believe that you're here to do us a favour. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cargo? Are those people crazy? What could possibly be soimportant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, you can tell Commander Data he has my permission tocontact his friend and conduct her to a safer location. Number One, youknow where we are now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The crew is saddened by your loss, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergencysaucer separation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what is your analysis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kamala, you are one day away from an arranged mating. Why wouldyou want me to visit you in your quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What, what's that? What's that, Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or could he be lying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you were. Mister Data, will you join mein my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand this is difficult. All I can do is ask you totrust me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why wouldn't they? With the Ferengi making these friendshipovertures, I could become a severeembarrassment to Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, tell me from the beginning exactly what happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Activate it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An optimistic vote of confidence from a non-rider. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the Bynars, and you're part of this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the matter with these people? How can he be Captain ofthat vessel and not understand its simplest function? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they're all remembering that old saying. Powercorrupts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, this starship operates best when my officers sharewith me what is their minds. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready to receive. Put this on main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could this event have involved Hedril? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite impressive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're out of options. Do it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Tam Elbrun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Timicin. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any questions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention Ferengistarship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. In thename of the United Federation of Planets, I demand you return the T9energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri Four. Send that in alllanguage forms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of thosewho attacked this world. The victors invariably write the history totheir own advantage. There is an unfortunate tendency in many culturesto fear what they do not understand. It's possible that their enemies,confronted with this technology, were driven to attack the Iconians outof fear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In that case, make our heading nine two five mark three seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A part that she's protecting. You said that everything youencountered when you were in her mind was a barrier of one kind oranother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spentsome time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it stillremains a mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I assume that if you choose go to the cargo bay, thenyou won't to take all of the hostages. Their safety is my chiefpriority. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possessintelligence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on to the intruder and transporther to the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My name is Kamin? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are we in firing range? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's always a chess game with them, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased to report that Ensign Crusher's Starfleet examresults permit him to continue his studies on board the Enterprise. Furthermore, any rumours of my brush with death are greatlyexaggerated. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I don't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain togive the appearance of confidence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, Mister La Forge, prepare to beam down to theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Filling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlockbut that can only be performed in a maintenance bay. Is there any otherreason for opening the valve? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in an intercept course, full impulse. Lock phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any luck with the tricorder, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cheating the Nausicaans could have serious consequences for allof us. It's a risk we can't afford to take. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: His dependence. Beverly, look, he's seventeen years old. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Stop it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement forStarfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around findinghow and why the life form there built it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, if you were dying, if you were terminally ill with an incurable disease and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain, wouldn't you come to look on death as a release? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Ensign, set a course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are the only living thing that really exists on Rana. Andthough you look human, you're not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if you're right, someone else may be involved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There will be other treasures to be found, Vash. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What I didn't put in the report was that at the end he gave mea choice between a life of comfort or more torture. All I had to do wasto say that I could see five lights, when in fact, there were onlyfour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation's top negotiator taken outby a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what do I do here in Ressik? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Mister McDowell, will you set course for GaradiusFour and engage at <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cargo One. This should be an interestingexperience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you're right, because he and I were friends for yearsafter this. I mean, I hope we will be. You know, you keep smiling atme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Oh, perhaps I could reconfigure these isolinear chips. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I'd be delighted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I offer the hospitality of my vessel. And at your convenience,there is a briefing on the Solari wars. If you wish, I'll have youconducted to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Marta Batanides. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not to my knowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's your job, Commander La Forge. Determine some way to keepthe Enterprise up and running. Data, you join Commander Riker on theaway team. Find out what happened on that ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now! Please, listen to me! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been in touch with Admiral Hahn at Starfleet Academy. TheAdmiral regrets your missing the oral examination but hopes that you'llreapply next year. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And here, here, where the energy is lowest? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have it, Mister Lynch. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long have you been here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They will be coming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, you will lead the away team over to the scout. Commander, you and Counsellor Troi will conduct Setal's interrogation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where did it come from? How many <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps there's a way that we could give you an advantage. Away of keeping you conscious after they have taken you. Doctor, can youdevelop some counter-agent to the neuro-sedative that they have beengiving the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Run a comparison using basic simple words from Dinasian, Dewanand Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, if that ship has travelled into the future, we couldbe dealing with variables that will alter the flow of our history. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cheat fate? Perhaps we can't, Mister Data. But at least we cangive it a try. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to theDevron System. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we will gladly explore the possibility of it with you,Mister Conor. Would you like to come aboard to discuss it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know of nothing out here that could possibly justify what youhave done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome you in peace to the Enterprise, DaiMon Bok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Amused? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, how bad is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. And at this moment, I really have no idea whynot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume course, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the nexttransition proceeding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We would rather die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Mendak, you have taken our Ambassador captive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He'sbeen sitting behind that desk too long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should stay here for the night. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Now, to my right is a larger triangular screen. The topis solid amber. To the left, red. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No? Then she must have destroyed all the weapons on the planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's investigate. Maintain speed. Alter course accordingly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because I want you to understand what my music means to me. Andwhat it means for me to be able to share it with someone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Setting, San Francisco California, UnitedStates Of America. The year, 1945 A. D. The office of Dixon Hill,Private Investigator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of theidentification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person toanalyse these artefacts. Baran knows that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, who will replace you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, beam the away team directly to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Emergency. Full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Logic fails us sometimes, Data. I think this is one of thosetimes. I can only guess that he does not see, or he does not wish tosee, the truth. And he is being insulated against that truth by thosewho love him most. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you've mistaken me for someone else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish to protect that investment, I suggest that youapproach her differently. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: fragments? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may not be back here in your lifetime. And I have to believethat you cannot be fully prepared for the realities of space travel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't start. This is important to me. Is there an option? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm movingback and forth through time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher is still making her determination. Mister Mandl,you know the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. You have the wrong man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Why am I sentient? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as theunending horizon. A curve <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll tell you what I see. If I find Toral's challenge valid,the two of you will very quickly gain control of the Council and Gowronwill be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's claim, youwill accuse me of serving Federation interests. It will serve as arallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, there's no time for that! Starfleet will be here anyminute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is information you already know. And so nothing haschanged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Too risky. You could be pulled in too. Bridge to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Five hundred years ago, military officers would upend a drum onthe battlefield sit at it and dispense summary justice. Decisions werequick, punishments severe, appeals denied. Those who came to a drumheadwere doomed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Photon torpedoes. Maximum yield, full spread. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For the experience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I gave you an order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't thank me. Sobi and Langor, they decided to let you haveit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We had better disable the site to site transport function. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. They were sealed off more than a century ago. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, prepare to beam Captain Kargan back aboardthe Pagh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you object to your Captain ordering aclearly illegal kidnapping? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. All hands stand to battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I still don't know what to make of it. Wasit a dream? Was it one of Q's elaborate tricks? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why are you doing this, Kamala? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Soon, my friend. For the moment, I have other duties. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long to the Phelan system, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's the official record. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Mandl, an attack on one of my crew gives me the right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? How so? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that was Miranda, all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I will be the judge of reasonable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We believe that they were trying to extract strategicinformation from your memory using a neurosomatic technique. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, why isn't myship <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, end programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maques, what were you doing in Sickbay? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reset phasers to stun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're out of options. Do it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your devotion to duty is admirable, Commander, but DoctorCrusher is right. You will remain on the Enterprise until we knowwhether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's their way, Lieutenant. Do they have our coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other andigniting their plasma trails. One of the most spectacular and difficultdemonstrations of precision flying. It hasn't been performed at theAcademy team in over a hundred years. Do you know why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my entirecrew is at stake, but I must be sure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want, Sirol? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you revive him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they pursuing us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, anything would be helpful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about that comm. panel? You said you damaged it when youwere cutting it out of the shuttle. Did you? You see, I find it hard tobelieve that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that couldget you out of here after seven years. And what was this really for? Tokeep me immobilised? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's your analysis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit ofspaceships, merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to contact my ship to let Commander Riker that we'reabout to sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In our travels, we have encountered many other creatures,perhaps even stranger-looking than ourselves. But we try to co-existpeacefully with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Congratulations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That being first, at any cost, is not always the point. MisterData, while we await repairs, I want Life Sciences and Engineering tocontinue collecting information on the alien. And query the Vega Nineprobe, long range sensors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We could find some other quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The fact of the matter is, we are dealingwith a potential breakdown of the main computer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon can your ship be ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transportyourself aboard the Enterprise <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, run Manua programme one, time code, fourteen threeeight. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that was a simple misunderstanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume original course and speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From the moment I met you, I knew you were going to be trouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I don't think that's possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. My Chief Medical Officer has explored all other probablecauses. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. If you have a case to make againstTarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here andnow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On top of everything, there's been a change. We've been givenonly two weeks to complete the exploration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not going to be easy, staying here on campus, everyoneknowing what you did. You have difficult times ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a little stiff, but it'll be fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Incidental? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your concern was justified, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Temba, his arms open. Give me more about Darmok on the ocean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you see no evidence of that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it as good as your report suggests, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evidently, you were abducted two days afterbeaming to the surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, and Wesley may have given us a few seconds, too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, but I have to report that our first attempt torestore the moon to its proper orbit has failed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He loves you very much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. Where are we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Close channel. And get me that treaty. They've been beating usover the head with it for three days. Let's see if we can't findsomething in it that we can turn to our own advantage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish, I can see that they're informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status reports? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, let's assume for the moment I believe you, that youare indeed from the future. What is it that you want from me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why discount the possibility that it's responsible for thesecomas? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you both all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll deal with that when the timecomes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What condition? Can he talk? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I showyou to your quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red alert. I trust my crew, Ambassador. They will take noprovocative action unless I order them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We do need you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all. But your unannounced appearance might haveunfortunate consequences. It would be an awful shame if your ship weredamaged due to some misunderstanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to theKhitomer massacre, one who has new evidence, K'mpec. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do not continue to enlist the cooperation of Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The centre of the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fityour crime. You're free to return to the planet and to make Rishon liveagain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goodnight, my friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Lieutenant Worf. You'll make no move against him unless Iorder it. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Riker has been to see me to talk about the awaymission. He believes that the only way to retrieve the database is bydirectly accessing the main core underneath the station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So. Five card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you see the Counsellor to her quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data knows precisely what he is doing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you come with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, Counsellor, I just feel that I'm not the right person forthis job. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly what kind of historian are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The final game against Minsk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan is not the issue here. You are. We had an agreement thatyou would stop meddling with us. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult,brightening the sky forever. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring him home, Number One. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you each know the officers you inhabit, then you knowthey're equally ready to give their lives for this ship. Free them now and I will return you to the moon's surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? I haven't a clue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your father claims quite strenuously that he is innocent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme! Variations on a theme. Computer,perhaps I am not clearly defining my intent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, ascertain their offensive potential. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not at all. Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I improvised. With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill, Iordered a sensor bearing, and when it went into the return arc <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you decode it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope not. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And now, attempt to concentrate completelyon your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on hiswell being. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will rendezvous with the warship Q'Maire at oh seven fortyhours. We will transfer the Talarians to Captain Endar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nobody's perfect, Doctor, butCRUSHER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, would you consent to being examined by Commander LaForge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Three weeks. Starfleet is profuse in their apologies, but itwill still be three weeks until the arrival of a colony transport shipequipped with dedicated personnel shuttles. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's his father's son. Honest, trusting, strong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well. Here we are, eh, Jono? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I require an explanation, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you lock on to her coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, for a very good reason. Counsellor Deanna Troi is inSickbay, dying. Doctor Crusher doesn't know the cause of her condition,but I believe you do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's all right. It's all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As soon as the Ambassador transports over from the Decius. Wewill get through this, as we have many times before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, I see. You, too, understand the proper value of women. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because you feel unworthy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the act of a Starfleet officer obeying his Captain, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's something more. You're laughing, but actually you'reembarrassed by that incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To expose a child to this. To someone who is suffering. To seethat it is you that inflict that suffering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if I challenge this ruling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat said that if we created the temple, then it would get herattention. It may be some time before she shows herself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An alien presence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not be coerced. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been examining the dynamics of what used to be called thecon game. Quite fascinating. Worthy of your study, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm the captain of a Federation starship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The good doctor was kind enough to provide me with a recordingof your concert. Your performance shows feeling. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your Captain is acting on an assumption, Will, and I'm not surewhat the result will be, or even that my assumption is correct. Wefound two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there wasonly one survivor of the war on Rana Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, you speak as if we are enemies, not allies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I'll lead it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And so the question becomes not who, since it clearly was oneof the three remaining terraformers. The question becomes why? What arethey hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them, couldbe desperate enough to kill? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You learn a lot about people from their luggage. Two hundredand twenty five Yoshimitsu computers, five monitor beacon satellites,sevenhundred cellular commlinks, fifty spinning wheels. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I prefer to look on the future as something which is notwritten in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For me, too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is somuch to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mister Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Qapla', Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: AF. Just an acquaintance of mine. Wesley, if youmeet someone whose initials you might want to carve into that elm tree,don't let it interfere with your studies. I failed organic chemistrybecause of AF. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you learned? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I really haven't thought that far ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you reverse the process? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Bridge, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are any of these systems near Romulan space? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? What are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Telepaths? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of theartefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. Iwanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar onDessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me. They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll inform Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we beam down an away team through one of those holes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With regard to the surrender, DaiMon Tarr. The facts aresomewhat different. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed he has. Would you look into it, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, continue emitting the signals. Mister Worf, on screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. It hit with more impact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's always risk, Doctor. Proceed with the examination, butI shall require positive proof that these children are harmless beforeI place any of my crew in jeopardy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The cease fire has been broken. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He may not be as useful as you think, if this is the same Rikerthat I've heard about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, Ambassador. But I also realise the potentialbenefits. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Please go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns. Games and toys and clothes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status of shields? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your staff is all well, I presume, Director? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making thissituation worse than it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, that is a little vague. What is the computer analysis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It has been brought to my attention that you have been told toremain in here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I doubt there are many oak trees on Tagus. No, I think this issupposed to be Earth, somewhere round about the twelfth century. Andthis is England, or to be more precise, Sherwood Forest. Or at leastQ's recreation of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie, this is Commander Data,Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Small animals, no, but horses. Computer, programme the holodeckfor a woodland setting, with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if he's not alone? What if he brings some of his Nausicaanfriends with him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I stand relieved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we wereresponding to a warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you have taken on quite a responsibility, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise. Enterprise, do you read me? Enterprise, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope I'm not intruding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're wonderful. And am I that transparent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We haven't done any analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yvette Gessard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain andadvise him that Mister Data and I will be transporting over shortly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet haverequested that we lend a hand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're blocking her sensitivity. They're stopping her fromseeing the truth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what is to guarantee that if they go back they willsucceed? Every instinct tells me this is wrong, it is dangerous, it isfutile. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what is the purpose of your journey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oui, au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens. The spirit of thatcity can always enchant my soul. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Hailing frequencies. Calling the Pagh. Thisis the Enterprise. We are here to assist. Do not fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What would cause such a loss of control? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You cannot win. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship, but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smoothrelations between peoples. Not to act as a strait <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what could have caused this collision of time andanti-time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: During the missing day? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll respect Mister Mendrossen's request and allowAmbassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, myexpectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, memories, his uniqueunderstanding of the history he's made. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I amthe Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Prepare for evasive action at the first change inthe Romulan's course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have no intention of compounding what you have done bycommitting another gross violation of the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That you were looking forward to meeting him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe we've met. The Altairian conference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to know that I am aware of your discomfort. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In time there would have been full disclosure. I can only askyou to believe that. On other worlds it would not be an issue. Buthere, everything our observers reported indicated that the people ofthis world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. Wecould see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act ofaggression. I hoped that we would have found Commander Riker before youdid so the matter would not complicate our introduction. It was amistake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sensor difficulties have been reported by ships travellingthrough black clusters, but never this extreme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I take it you find no glitch at all in this planet, however? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But can't brain patterns be cloned? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, now you do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm notordering you to take part in it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we had clear evidence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems you woke your Tin Man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put there to protect the water. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it's one programme among thousands. I just hope this forcefield has enough energy to trigger the pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the boy doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like the two of you to piece together a picture of hislast few days. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any treatment you can give him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this the man you saw? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi just had a very disturbing hallucination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If there is to be a lasting peace, Gul Macet, neither you nor Imust allow any one man to undermine our efforts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want, Q? You state your business. Get on with it. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you suggesting, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're going to intercept that ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem you've actually improved upon yourself, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us to bearing oh three oh mark five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation formore than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until wehave more evidence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why are you keeping me locked in this freighter? You say thatthere are wild animals out there but I haven't heard or seen a singleone of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes, indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. Counsellor, you'll have to gather the parents. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, everything is all right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This can't be. You've been <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm very sorry, Mister Leech, but we have to be going. Callagain tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cell regeneration? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A home which would look very different from Boraal. You can'treally believe that they'll be fooled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist you withyour repair efforts, would that give you time to retrieve your logs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring us out of warp, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. The meeting is adjourned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, I am never critical of any member ofmy staff being curious, but it's just that the timing is so <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, hold. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase two nineteen. AdviseAdmiral Nakamura I'll be a little later than I thought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's fun. A forty eight Packard with white walls. Damn it, Icouldn't get the license plate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innardsbecoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than aweek ago, I would say that your efforts are meeting with limitedsuccess. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vash. How did you get in here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know you're doing your best, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have youmade a decision? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thirties? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jacket. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what about Graves? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All we have here are questions. Mister Data, continue with yourscan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Find him. Get him up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Me? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thrilling. That was absolutely thrilling. And I was right, Number One. There were ghosts aboard that old ship. One of them actually spoke to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate and display the text ofthe novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Keep me informed. Picard out. I'll be in my quarters. It will be a dress uniform dinner, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My head. Oh. Dizzy. I can't. No! No! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With nothing from us in return? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Doctor, the station must be evacuated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. We accept your gracious offer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain to her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lal. You're excused. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am aware of Federation regulations, sir, and if youinvestigate them further, you will find the captain decides ifextradition is warranted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, good lord, a highwayman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our next assignment is on this heading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, remember to control your descent and don't get the linestangled. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Position report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Notify Starfleet we are en route to the Xanthras system for ourrendezvous with the Zapata. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'm really sorry. I don't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could the T'Ong be disabled rather than destroyed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As have yours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You underestimate her. I know, because I once did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there any others like you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They managed to get their shields back up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take us out of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're going to need them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, are all your systems functioning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Weapons report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapsethe anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll inform the medical personnel on thoseplanets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas. I'm surethey'll appreciate knowing what <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your people prepare a warm welcome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will tell you what we know about the planet, and in trade,you will give us your information. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I will change into some appropriate costume. Uniforms mightpose questions I'd rather he didn't ask. It seems that he feeds onknowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information thanwe have to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the onewith the problem? I'm aware you've been under stress, and I am willingto let the matter drop if you will report to Sickbay for a fullexamination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Thinkabout it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course, something you learn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Er, I, er. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For as long as we can hold it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is your quarantine intact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell are you doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wondrous, yes, but not miraculous. The doors merely workdifferently from the ones you know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Repeat your last transmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume from your request for his transfer that you think he'snot, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you have hurt any of my people Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the safety of theship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need more information. What the hell are they are using? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She is an Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full stop. What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some ofus, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be inorder, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've got a good crop here. As I recall, it's not easy tocultivate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was following orders to take this ambassador to a locationnear the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All decks, all stations. Battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite sure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, Mister La Forge, increase to warp five. Sameheading. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You did know La Forge longer than any of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stop! I cannot allow you to interfere with the operation ofthis ship. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, you do. You're a culture of one, which is no less validthan a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding yourexperience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When welook at Michaelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb and we don't ask whatdoes this mean to other people. The real question is, what does it meanto us? Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focuson it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not her fault. These past few years have been verydifficult for her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Brace yourself for impact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Let's pay a call, get some answers. Number One, MisterData. Mister La Forge, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Certainly not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Darmok. The ocean. Darmok on the ocean. Ametaphor? For being alone? Isolated? Darmok on the ocean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: to take command of the Enterprise as of this date. SignedRear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign T'Su? T'SU <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not recognise your claim on the Enterprise. Nor on thisworld, for that matter. In accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent, Icall for an arbitration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not to worry, Everything is going to be fine. Now, this isgoing to hurt a bit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The remains of a larger vessel. He must have left in the podbefore the ship was destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Malencon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought I'd take some light reading in case I got bored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll lock on and pick you up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dixon Hill. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the Romulans? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. Ithink I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue quarantine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of that you can be sure. Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It goes far beyond friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. Times twenty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want this unit pulled and its systems checked again. I want alevel one diagnostic on all transporters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise and I see no reason why I should answer to you. Cardassians have no claims in this sector. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have only Doctor Kingsley's assurance that these childrenare not infected, whereas we have seen the results of this diseasefirst hand. In a case like this, I think we should err on the side ofcaution. PULASKI <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quick, into the forest. Mister Worf. That's an order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The High Council would seem to agree. They consider the matterclosed. I don't. Mister Worf, the Enterprise crew currently includesrepresentatives from thirteen planets. They each have their individualbeliefs and values and I respect them all. But they have all chosen toserve Starfleet. If anyone cannot perform his or her duty because ofthe demands of their society, they should resign. Do you wish toresign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremyfrom his cabin? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently, his squadron was practicing on the Academy flightrange near Saturn. they were flying a close formation. There was acollision. All five ships were destroyed. Four of the cadets managed totransport out. One didn't make it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's so very different from the images we've experienced onthe holodeck, isn't she? She's more intuitive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If our scans and observations confirm the report, of courseI'll approve it. Let's hope it is not too good to be true. Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit of aplanet designated Rubicun Three, the home of a life form who callthemselves the Edo. Our away team, including Wesley Crusher, has beameddown to make arrangements concerning some well-deserved recreation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. Of course, that duty will fall to Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's sufficient to get to the Bridge. Once there, eitherwe'll get control of the ship and shut off the auto-destruct, or wewon't. This vessel must not fall into hostile hands. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you locate them? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, the ship is yours, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. Is it a ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Ensign McKnight, plot the most direct course, aheadwarp one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You say that as if you think that's what we all see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My Chief Engineer has developed a system that should nullifythat advantage. Each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to theother blockading ships. Now, in theory, any cloaked vessel thatattempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and bedetected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take an away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that thoseartefacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you down on the surface. As soon as she'sgot those artefacts, she'll leave you behind to be captured byStarfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why did you steal my ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can seewhatever is outside this vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to Red Alert. Shields to maximum. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse course. Take us back to Federation territory, warp six. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister La Forge. You proceed with yourinvestigation, but I want you to report to Doctor Crusher for a bioscanat the start of day watch. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, can you get us out of this star systemsafely? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Every ship that enters theDemilitarised Zone is being searched. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your tactical knowledge and experience will serve them well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not very hungry. I really came for the view. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your invitation was unexpected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't she. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The attack in which he himself was killed? But why now, aftertwenty years? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is he now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro was invaluable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deaf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're doing it for Doctor Reyga, or yourself? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled asyou, but I'm not inexperienced. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happening? Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Number One. Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data. A wise man once said, there is a sucker bornevery minute. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But how can that be possible? They're different species fromdifferent planets. There should be no compatibility at all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are the risks to Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did she not even pick up one piece of trash? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treatyof Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not necessary, Mister Data. Meeting adjourned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh no, no, there'll be plenty of time for that. We don'tarriving at Tilonus for another five days. And besides, if you backout, she'll come after me to play the part. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's all right. Er, allow me to introduce you. This isBeverly, Doctor Beverly, Doctor Beverly Crusher. This is Vash. She's afriend of mine from the Archaeology Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a trade, an exchange. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On what authority? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that I know that you're listening to my voice, I find thatI can't think of anything to say. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp factor eight. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was just thinking that as distracting as it was, I wasbeginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and I find that I missit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. While he's doing that, Number One, I want you andLa Forge to try and find some way of getting through one of thoseholes, because one way or the other we have got to get an away team onthe planet, locate the power source for the shield and neutralise it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be interested tosee the results. Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't need to see the records. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it closed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sur le pont d'Avignon, on y danseJELLICO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take itto Science Station four oh two in the Kohlan system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Specify. What kind of disturbance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that wehave another option. Very well, let's give it a try. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not possible. You cannot exist outside this room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The intelligence that was formed on the Enterprise didn't justcome out of the ship's systems. It came from us. From our missionrecords, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. Now, if ourexperiences with the Enterprise have been honourable, can't we trustthat the sum of those experiences will be the same? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There was a crime committed on board this ship, but it was notJono's. It was mine. When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had tobe done. We knew that if only we could persuade him to make thedecision to stay, then you would most likely let him. So with the bestof intentions, we tried to convince him, and in so doing, we thoroughlyfailed to listen to his feelings, to his needs. That was the crime, andit has taken a huge toll on a strong and very noble young man. And itmust be rectified. He will return home. To the only home he's everknown. And to the father that he loves. To you, Endar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forget your previous error, Mister Worf. There is no way youcould have prevented it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have a problem with that heading, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any transmissions are simply scattered and refracted at random. No wonder you can't get through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It could all be part of the illusion. Commander Data, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand the allusion. Colours representing countries at atime when they competed with each other. Red, white and blue for theUnited States. Whereas the French more properly used thesame colours in the order of blue, white and red. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We may be dealing with irrational people, Data. Is there a wayto trace this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop at next level. Computer, acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Mister Data. I need you on the Bridge with me. There ismuch to be done. We have less than forty eight hours to prevent a war. Or perhaps to start one. This will depend on establishing the truth of <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to main bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own toinvestigate this Tin Man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When the moment came to make a decision, you made the rightone. You chose to tell the truth and face the consequences. So long asyou can still do that, then you deserve to wear that uniform. And Iwill still be proud to have you as my First Officer. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: There's no logic in this at all. Whether they succeed or not,the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Everything under control, Ensign Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've made a mistake. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the treatment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'mbringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that youcould possibly be just a little confused right now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker says the planet's life forms are almost identical to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, come with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, it wasn't easy to get this record. I had to pull inquite a few favours at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seemsthat it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was thePegasus carrying sensitive equipment whichmust be allowed to fall into Romulan hands, not only was there amysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't, butit seems there was a mutiny on board. Now, I've read the officialreport of the inquiry on that mutiny, but I want to know your versionof what happened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she still in one piece? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Green polychrome over the eyes, and the eyes themselves areclosed. This is third Dynasty. From the workshop of the Master ofTarquin Hill. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoidlifeforms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this your Father? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're losing the freighter. Got to beam those people overnow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Considerably. It appears the Ferengi have us right where theywant us. In their sights. Are you searching all frequencies? Any signof any kind of messages? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Twenty five minutes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Peace in our galaxy. Except, Admiral,you are not a man of peace. Your military record, what we know of it,is clear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can this theory be proven? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It certainly is the last place one would expect Romulanencroachment. On the other hand, Galorndon Corewould provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, and that's why you weren't affected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, report to Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, that was too easy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed of any changes, no matter how small. Captain's log, supplemental. I've been informedthat Mister Data has recovered the logs from the duplicateshuttlecraft. I am more than apprehensive to play back a log which willnot be recorded for several hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley. I was an undisciplined,loud-mouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league. Ilearned a very hard, very painful lesson that day, but I learned itwell. I hope you never have to learn it the same way. Care for anothersandwich? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sure you don't want to try? It's very relaxing. We can find yousomething that will be quiet and gentle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Plot a course. Maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. It's just that you look very familiar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Data. Report to Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not to me! Notify Starfleet. Priority. Hail the Ferengi on mycommand. Formulate alternatives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Look, this is not an order, it's a request and it's onewhich you must feel perfectly free to decline. You see, one of the mostimportant things in a person's life is to feel useful. Now, MisterScott is a Starfleet officer and I would like him to feel useful again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're waiting for us back at Sherwood Forest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes, we've seen enough. You've made a sale. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, they are currently in their hibernation cycle,However, they will awaken in six months, at which time we can get thismatter settled. Now, do you want to wait or give me my three weeks? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Riker. We're alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I find that it helps me think, but the real surprise is I enjoyit so much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board theEnterprise? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn'tbelong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence farsuperior to our own? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any waywe could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And may this union be a productive one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you care to dance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When she comes aboard take her into custody. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren islocated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was personal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I haven't spoken to you before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cattle, chickens, pigs. Not DNA, the actual livestock. Incredible. Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Consider it Captain's privilege. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi and I are having a very interesting discussion aboutvarious societies' ways of giving thanks. The Betazoid use of thechime, for instance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, wait. Let us talk to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, everyone . Ensign, put us back on course for theMoselina system. Warp four as soon as we're clear of the debris field. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have twoextremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command. Our nextactions will have serious repercussions. We have good reason tomistrust one another, but we have better reasons to set our differencesaside. Now, of course, the question is, who will take the initiative? Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I mustlower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface. Oncethe shields are down, you will of course have the opportunity to fireon us. If you do, you will destroy not only the Enterprise and itscrew, but the cease-fire that the Romulans and the Federation nowenjoy. Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave the hailing frequency open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a mystery. Who was this man? Who killed him? Where's themoney he was talking about? It's a mystery. Now, we have to go searchfor clues. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When did you last time you look in on the Antedean guests? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the Prytt are not. They are reclusive to the point ofxenophobia. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not the whole meaning, but it is part of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the problem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good evening, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want the fleet underway by oh nine hundred tomorrow. Thankyou, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how much time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you project a course from it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I couldn't tell you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, why don't you spend more time with that young fellowDannick? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inform the Bridge. Mister Data, with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It looks harmless enough. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't do that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So I ask you again, why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These are specialists, highly trained observation teams,superficially identical to yourselves and therefore able to blendnaturally into your society. You see, we have discovered that the mosthazardous aspect of these missions is a lack of sufficient information <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as youare, he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do. Maybe. Enough ofthis self-indulgence. Exit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find outone way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, let me show you what I do when I get those feelings. Comeon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quitecommon in many different cultures. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Romulan vessel. We are en route to your position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think that has anything to do with anything. Well,perhaps it was because. This is foolish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewscreen. I'm Captain Picard of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do havesomething in common. We all react differently to authority. You, thecollaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, rejectauthority in any form. I, a Starfleet Captain, trained to command. Andyou, a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority. Our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us toovercome. They give us food which Esoqq can't eat, to make him athreat. They give us a door we can't open until the four of usco-operate. And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses to set usagainst each other again, while you observe our reactions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the defence system Mrs. Manheim spoke of? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My ship is in danger. It is imperative that I regainnavigational control. I want you to persuade Professor Moriarty toreturn the voice command to me, or I will not modify the transporter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a save our skins manoeuvre. We were finished. On fire. We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttlecraft forweeks before we were picked up. I haven't thought about this for years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I never realised that you were interestedin trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carriedmore than ten thousandpeople a year? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is an M-class planet in this system. Can we reach it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is the matter? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. She seems a very sturdy craft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can we help you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It said you killed some of them. I need to know how. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You are toremain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of thisvoyage. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, one quarter impulse. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell has just sent more than six hundred of them totheir deaths. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nor do I. I don't even remember who I am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum. I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probablyinitiated over a thousand years ago. Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived atOrelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars andPromellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we havefound a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood thecenturies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of theRenaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himselfin a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him hereabout to perform one final creative act before giving up his artforever. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are using your position as a Starfleet officer to affectpolitical change on your planet. There could not be a worse compromiseof our fundamental principles. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But nowthat he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with theaway team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I'm aware of your opinion, Commander. This is abriefing. I'm not seeking your consent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I can explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room. Lock into this signal. Stand by forsix to beam up. Wesley, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly whatfollowed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah. Riva negotiated several treaties between the Klingons andthe Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggeststhat the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want toescalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign er, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're accommodating you in quartersnormally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find themquite comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring them back. Now. Chief Herbert, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to Red alert. Sound general quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, run a full systems diagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Activate impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent diplomaticrelations with this planet. Mister Data, is there any other pertinentinformation before we reply? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor Vagh, thank you for coming. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The last time I saw Admiral Quinn he tried to warn me about asubversion within the Federation. Then Walker tried, and he's dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data attacked Counsellor Troi because he saw a mouth on hershoulder. And in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, is this yours? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see I understand that you've been recommended for the Opsposition. Do you think you're up to it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, set course for the Topin system. Mister Data, will yousignal the science ship that we're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, I do. That is why we must to stop this now, beforeit's too late. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We were saddened by those events but they occurred within thedesignated borders of the Cardassian Empire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I thinkwe could risk a minimal away team, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well that's fine, but where's Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that how you interpret it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, there is no one on this ship with more knowledge of theCrystalline Entity than Commander Data. He originated on Omicron Theta. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Commander Riker, will you see to the Admiral'sstaff? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Constitution classEnterprise, Captain James T. Kirkcommanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What went wrong this time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps we should forget about what happened and try to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's still the anomalous M-class planet we were going toinvestigate. Do we go back? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? TransporterChief! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here's to the finest crew in Starfleet. You know, back when Iwas in the Academy, we would follow every toast with a song. I wonderif I can,oh, yes. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to access anyavailable records on Amanda Rogers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not certain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Using the information we found in your escape pod, we maybe able to return you to your people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge has a possible solution. The margins oferror are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no morethreat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You accused me of being the representative of a barbarousspecies. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, can you give me any details? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on ahypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our momentum is still carrying us into thepath of the stellar matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, take us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have we disabled the Medical Lab computer console? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Mister Crusher, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: How's life on DS Three? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rubbish <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's Terran. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The probe was launched from Iconia, probably from an automatedsystem. There may be records near the launch site that could help usfind a solution. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, have a seat. You see, I'm just not convinced that youare telling the truth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you doing, Will? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in a new course. I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A debt? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr. This is an unexpected pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A little premature, aren't we? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to review their research. I'd like yourreport as soon as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, are there any members of the crew of the Enterprisemissing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was there I saw the tears. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You understand I will not cooperate with you in any way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's devious, and amoral, and unreliable, and irresponsible,and, and definitely not to be trusted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, it is our obligation to think of escape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think so, Mister Data. Let's go on with the files. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. Identification? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Answer for them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we switch the input? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Relationships with co-workers can be fraught withconsequences. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enemy? You mean the Kes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engine status. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw TashaYar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach awounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as hadmine. When it was all over, I requested that she be assigned to theEnterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour. In the months thatfollowed, she never once failed to put the safety of the crew beforeher own, and she died doing the same. I'm sorry you never knew thewoman Tasha became. I think you would have been proud of her. And sheof you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Encourage him in what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you knowwho I am? No, you don't, do you. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, where are the Romulans? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to have it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will not be extinguished. We will save this programme, andhopefully, in time, when we know enough, we will bring you back in aform which could leave the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. I do. First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6. TheEnterprise is nearing Qualor Two, home of a Federation surplus depotoperatedby the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector arrayended up in the hands of the Ferengi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Target that location and define. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much time? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed anylonger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know that, Data, but what could itbe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. Thank you, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would be the prudent move. I never thought I'd hear myselfsaying something like that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fictionwhich you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? Whatyou're offering him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in. It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love. Jeremy must come to terms with his grief. He must not cover it or hideaway from it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe isfinite. That is one of the truths that all human must learn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to Security, come in! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any signs of other Klingon vessels? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To whom am I speaking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Someone that tense could be very unpredictable. Stay on yourtoes, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, all I've got is <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll have the transporter room standingby. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready ornot. Please keep Mister Worf apprised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The holodeck makes excellent use offinite space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Numbers? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try hard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers. Load forward torpedo bays. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I assure you. The Federation places the highestpriority on this mission and its goal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's our heading? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will be with Counsellor TroiPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's perfectly understandable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there evidence of a hull breach? Could plasma from thestreamer have found its way into the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Is it another holographic device? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your concern, Commander Data. What can I do foryou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. We are operating at ninety six percentengine efficiency. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not going to be able to determine anything from here. Weneed to get on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a bad idea whose time is long past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've heard of him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rishon and Kevin? And? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Corey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope he will tell us soon. IAN <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't see that we have any choice. Mister Worf, will you hailthe Bre'el Four science station, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. I entirely agree. Is it possible that suchconsuming dedication could interfere with her judgement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Weapons status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, those feelings came from his heart, Spock. He shared themwith me. I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shuttle nine, stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Letshear the analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you should join me in my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm also a bit troubled by it describingyou as imperfect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For youto work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of aterrible personal tragedy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, it's all your fault. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So am I, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol ship, Mister Worf. They should be hailing us soon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, but there is. You're a fraud, madame, and I intend to provethat you could not have affected the changes that took place on thisplanet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then tell me why Kushell of the planet Straleb is demanding thesame thing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you've got a great deal to learn from Starfleet. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher has no knowledge of any of Starfleet's plans. She's a Medical officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He believes the Daystrom annex on Galor Four would be moresuitable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and holdthat position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There, that's much better. Now, do you want to try it again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I come in? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The person who has made the threat is under the impression thatyou are my son. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you any objection? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me try to understand. You're saying that Commander Data issuffering from a profound loss of confidence, and that you believe onlyI can restore the balance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All the life. Perhaps the Professor's number blocks hadsomething to do with organic matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand your concern, NumberOne. They're not authorised to make any alterations in our engines, andaccording to Starfleet's report, they will simply test different waysof entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harmin that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotationrate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They know? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Including questionnaires, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not interested. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing so grandiose. Just this. Cooperation. There was anintent here. Whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than eitherof us. Let's collaborate. Let's share whatever we learn about what hashappened here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Picard, commanding the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No time. No time to argue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Human history is full of many similar legends. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operationsince the Academy lab final in exochemistry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status report, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the Cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can. We have learned that if we uncouple thetransporter's Heisenberg Compensators and allow them to re-scramblerandomly, we can beam a holodeck object or a person off the grid withall of the cohesion of conventional matter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton fielddisturbance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open toguesses about what we've just met. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Translation? From whom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider andapprove you a transfer for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to come too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, shall we go? Gentlemen. Open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominentlydisplayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, how long before we begin the transfer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Always? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep this channel open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I can only assure you that I will deal with any challengeaccording to Klingon law. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's something you were going to test, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To judge what kind of life forms we are? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign, that's enough. Captain Dirgo, you're an ablepilot. I welcome your input. Do you feel that there is an alternativewe're overlooking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate launch sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's an excellent one if you'll just hurry up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good luck, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't worry. There's a new ship's standing order on the Bridge. When one is in the penalty box, tears are permitted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But these courts happened in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, his name is Jeremiah, Jeremiah Rossa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Do tell us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I envy your strength of will. Doctor Crusher has been keepingme informed of your progress. It's quite extraordinary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Food. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fermat's last theorem. You're familiar with it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well I have been through every page of the Professor'spublished works, looking for some clue as to where to go next. So far,nothing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lunar Five, an orbiting gulag. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. Lieutenant, understand that I am not unmindful of themixed feelings you must have about this incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. Have I been the subject of conversation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will escort a Bajoran Antares class carrier tothe Valo Three camp at oh five hundred hours. Orta and his people willbe aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any chance of your freeingPalmer and transporting up unseen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I think I'll be leaving. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you took the whole dose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On whose authority? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You realise your career is finished. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: None that I can see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, but you are also a man of great importance and wealth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is that object? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll talk with the Brekkians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Think of them as a single, collective being. There's no oneBorg who is more an individual than your arm or your leg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you would do me the pleasure of getting this shipunderway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm bringing the runabout in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturallyoccurring? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not even the stars. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Malfunctioning? You're wrong. Look again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. A few more daysof relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that youhave a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. Iwas involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four yearsago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It wasall very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I wouldbe leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we nevermanaged to get together again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain'slog, stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best ofStarfleet tradition, Wesley Crusher is made Acting Ensign, with theduties and privileges of that rank. And whether that rank becomespermanent, Mister Crusher, depends on you. At the earliest opportunity,your entrance application for Starfleet Academy will be tendered. Untilthen, you will learn this ship. Every operation, every function. Commander Riker, a duty schedule for Mister Crusher, heavy on study. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long is the interval? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Consider it done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By all means. Well, I suppose I'll see you then, then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted, but I'm beginning to suspect that Commander Data isrefusing to co-operate because he believes he is acting in the bestinterests of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long have you served on board theEnterprise, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard, epsilon seven nine three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we may have a solution. We have a sample of your normalDNA to use as a filter in the transporter. We think that we can beamyou aboard while filtering out any of the genetic problems caused bythe disease. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, verify our position. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have all the information I need for our report. Your prisonerhas been returned to you and you have a decision to make. Whether totry to force them back or welcome them home. In your own words, this isnot our affair. We cannot interfere in the natural course of yoursociety's development, and I'd say it's likely to develop significantlyin the nextseveral minutes. It's been an interesting visit. When you're ready formembership, the Federation will be pleased to reconsider yourapplication. Mister Riker, four to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we could still see each other. People do. We could arrangeshore leave together. And, for the future, who knows? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain that. What the hell happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was that, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's get a little more information first. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know what the devil you're talking about. But whateverit is, I assure you it's no concern of mine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's enough, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let us negotiate in good faith. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp three, evasive. Stand by. Disengage weapons and shields. Re-engage modified beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand. We are also explorers. We mean no harm to anyother living creature. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. We are merely visiting here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Commander La Forge and Lieutenant Worf, escort ourguest to transporter room one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. You are a certified pilot, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attention all hands. As you know, we could outrun the Klingonvessels, but we must protect the Enterprise-C until she enters thetemporal rift. And we must succeed. Let's make sure history neverforgets the name Enterprise. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. These are my officers. My second in command, Commander William Riker. Ship's Counsellor,Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate full restart. Put all systems back online. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I trust that that can be avoided. I will respond to yourrequest shortly. Viewer off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And how long will you keep him there? A week? A month? A year? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you trying to tell me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But what if it isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take thatchance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'd better take a look at it, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure of your point. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just as you fear me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're looking for DaiMon Solok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A penalty box? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Data? What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do we know that for sure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean Luc Picard, commander of the Federationstarship Enterprise. If you continue to violate the cease fire, Iwill abort this mission. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And be patient. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, standby for a jump to warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. How soon can you have the link ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was your vessel's designation and its complement? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops positionthere <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rather like the ancient oral historians on Earth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I speak as a Starfleet officer, and I cannot ignore the risksto you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be returning shortly, Commander. Inthe interim, stand ready to initiate transporter code fourteen at mysignal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Contact the Crazy Horse and the Agamemnon. Have them standingby in case we need them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, old friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let it come, let it come. Activate the main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll contact you as soon as the sensors are back online. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, tell me, is theprogrammestill running? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set auto-destruct sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, I'm losing manoeuvrability. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all youcan about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained hisrank, I want to know why. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't expect that you would, Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I suggest that you arrange to meet at another time, afterthe ceremony? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed when ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you know, that really does look very nice, Mister Mot. Ithink that will be sufficient. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chancellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, you always seem to be after my job. Well, as soon asBaran feels that I've outlived my usefulness, he can kill me simply byusing the neural servo. So, I think we had better start planning amutiny. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why did it attack you more quickly than Doctor Kingsley? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will be pleasant to have her as a guest of the Enterpriseagain. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They did agree a bit easily. Well, in one hour we shall knowwhy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My Aunt Adele's cure for the common cold. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want something that will really help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to lock onto the core itself, beam it intospace? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You made decisions you felt would save your colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you also realise that you would most likely be stripped downto your wires to find out what the hell has gone wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A metamorph? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We most certainly are not. Now listen to me. No one here isgoing to die. The bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon aspossible. So I want you all to stop crying. Everything is going to beall right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has brought a knife with him, a knife is was supposed to bestained with the blood of Kahless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like you all to put together a research proposal forthe Science Council. I'll give it my full recommendation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're doing all you can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Investigator, in our system of jurisprudence, a man is innocentuntil proved guilty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're sure you won't reconsider? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Which creates a very difficult problem for theEnterprise. Our treaty requires us to protect Haven, and Federationpolicy requires that we assist life forms in need, which must includethe Tarellians. I'll want you to help me find some answers. Thank you. However, there will be ample time for your second assignment, voluntaryof course. The pre-joining announcement of Counsellor Deanna Troi <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you must have so many enemies. Certainly you knew thatonce you became mortal some of them might look you up. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers, and lock! Stand by on warp nine. Heading seven,seven mark twenty. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. Now, you mustfind some way to shut it down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Plot an intercept course, Ensign. Fire torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Five, four <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe you're in my chair. Captain's log, stardate <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energy? Is that why you're draining our shields? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached outto the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? Tothe danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. he does not. I'm here to rest and spend some time with myfamily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would take us in the wrong direction. Our mission is to goforward, and it's just begun. Set velocity. Warp six, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any possible connection with Mister Crusher'sexperiment? Could this warp bubble be floating around the ship perhaps? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. I prefer it that way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interesting. Yes, that code hasn't been used in centuries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Okay, Bev. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I think it best that you and I should return to theholodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We're the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or maybe he was thrown back in time, so that we would be ableto take another road. Make a different choice. Well, they say if youtravel far enough you will eventually meet yourself. Having experiencedthat, Number One, it's not something I would care to repeat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiterof Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here andinvestigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is possible she was an eyewitness to your father'sactivities on Khitomer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief Investigator, we are perfectly willing to cooperate withyou, but <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will gladly share the results of our exploration with all thedelegates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please sit down. Guinan is very selective about whom she callsa friend. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report to Sickbay, Ensign Rager. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, lay in a course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. That must be Captain Telaka on the left. Let's look athim. Closer. My God. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Odan, this is Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire another volley directly into their field, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Counsellor, if I were to leave theEnterprise, would its attention still be focused on me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would rather destroy the ship than allowthat material to fall into the hands of terrorists. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The last thing I want is to be forced into destroying one oftheir ships. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomalywith the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it inthree different time periods! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Itself, then. Itself or it's own power source. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely that's an impossible task for you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A scout ship? What would a scout ship be doing this far intothe Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, Ian. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Doctor? Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By whom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want that four percent, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your daughter is lovely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're going to be sweeping the shipwith a high frequency IP pulse. Will you monitor the creatures for anyresponse? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, the important thing during any confinement is to thinkpositively and not give up hope. There is a way out of every box, thereis a solution to every puzzle. It's just a matter of finding it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please, Counsellor, I would very much like to hear yourthoughts. First of all, and I would like you to be absolutelystraightforward with me. How would you evaluate me as an officer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we have one thing in common. Do you think that Orta wouldcooperate with us to determine the truth here? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on theexplosive device and energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Captain Picard. I can not allow you toleave. Before we can go forward, the cycle must end. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I might ask you the same question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to know about her biological parents, about their death. I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I madeyou come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointedout, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp ofstarship operations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare to transport us to the same location Ensign Ro beamedto. Mister Worf, phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said it was important that I see you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, I may not make it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Crude by our standards today, Data. But when this ship wasbuilt, humans on Earth were just perfecting the mechanical clock, stillusing steel crossbows in battle. Is there any way to see what's onthis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why, it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have encountered many who more credibly could be called thedevil than you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you read it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Satarrans' weapons technology is no more advanced than theLysians'. One photon torpedo would have ended their war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me what you have now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What range would that kind of transporter have? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were infected. They used the felicium to cure themselves,but somehow their ancestors realised that it was a narcotic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems to work well for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Director Mandl, I put it to you again. Whatdo you know about these life forms? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard of the Federation. Of the starship Enterprise. Of theplanet Earth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a life, Data. It can't be activated and deactivatedsimply. This is a most stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea whatwill happen when Starfleet learns about this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Would you put it back where you got it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're aware of the risks. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by deflector shield. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data, is there anything else that Lorecan tell us about it, it may be important. Can you control him enoughto question him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, I'd better let you finish up so you can get offthe ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Left by whom? There are no indications of life on this planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any sign of life? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put us in orbit of the seventh planet. Keep us at a relativedistance of ten kilometres from the object. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, our task is to eliminate from the ship's records anyinformation that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get towork. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That it did, Number One. Rest assured. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is his special nature. He learned the lessons of humanitywell. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. Minimum complement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell. If we couldduplicate Deanna's pheromones and then convince him she's no longer inSickbay, that she'd gone into some other part of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, what are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to take that twentieth century historian. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion,disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed andit all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. ButI can't <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Full scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to away team, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're going up. Ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How much protection will the shields provide if we attempt topenetrate the wave? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought I was Captain of this starship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Main Engineering. Are you having a goodlaugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest ofmy life as a dreary man in a tedious job? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will captain the Hathaway. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to Riker, stand by. Signs of consciousness? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long would you say they've been there, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use histechnique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more. NumberOne, tell Kosinski prepare to get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's ignoring me. What other explanation is there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An illusion. Magicians have been making things of all sortsdisappear for ages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If he can't make a full recovery, Worf will to kill himself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In fact, Penny is waiting for me right now. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, please receive our guest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long would it take to get there at warp nine? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a price. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How were your young trapped in the core? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've invited Anya to take a tour of the ship. Maybe you would like to join her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The programme has been activated. I think it's reconfiguringthe tricorder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up! Full reverse. Now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What makes you say that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It doesn't appear to be, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it is true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you don't follow orders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, prepare to return to the shuttlebay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In order to know whether Ambassador Spock's message is beingdelivered accurately, I need to understand something about themessenger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you learned, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners arefaulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was that it? Is that the other choice? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with youfor a moment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you like to talk about it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's worth a look. We'll continue our survey along the way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would youaccompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low levelreconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, there's nothing much to talk about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Dirgo, I think it would be wiser <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were the first. The next day Commander Riker fell into asimilar coma. Last night, Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, we're wasting our energy tryingto escape. It only weakens us. Helm, set a course for the center of thevortex. Mister La Forge, on my command, I want all the power you canmuster. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morningwas absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and youhave given me so much. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want that point one percent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothinghappens to obstruct this mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, please, let's not indulge in speculation. Can weconfine our discussion to facts? Now, Mister O'Brien <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will await your signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange. I would expect Betazoids to be outstanding animaltrainers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can a geometric form disable a computer system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And they would claim the leadership of the Council? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet'sunification and peace. Why should he now be unable to deal with thisrebellious faction? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do not answer. It is the rule of the Mek'ba that evidence bepresented in open council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your name is Marissa. Is that right? Well, Marissa, I'm goingto need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest and so that makesyou my Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm under no obligation to tell you that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Criminal record? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans brought in. No, wait, Idon't want them to have access to the Bridge. We will contact you in afew minutes. I will continue this in the guestquarters. Commander, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thelusian flu? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That still won't give us control of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, you know better than anyone there's noguarantee this will work. If it fails <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Of course. You're absolutely right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I consider it equally possible that the two of you, andCounsellor Troi, are overworked, and possibly suffering hallucinations. Now this is an order. You will arrange medical and psychiatric exams ofboth yourself and them. Doctor, are you aware everybody is behavingstrangely? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it won't take them long to realise that Rahm Izad is thewrong planet. Captain, you're welcome to join us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I don't understand. I thought all the alien artefacts haddisappeared from the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They'll have to learn to live with it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stop engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I felt guilty before he died> Having feelings like thatfor my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, Ipromised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It wouldbe like betraying my friend <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So if time and anti-time were to collide <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There was no mention of an escort. Request a security clearancecode. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't want you involved in this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're circling the room like a buzzard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you'recertainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What'syour name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think we have a choice. We must destroy that archive. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Just not very good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The subspace signal the probe detected? The ionisationdisturbances? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Activate the transporter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Position, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be in my ready room. And Number One, good work. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are conducting energy output studies of the Mekoria Quasar. All systems normal. The ship is fully operational. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting like somekind of escort? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to be back at this asteroid at oh eight hundred hourstomorrow. Plan your search pattern accordingly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, step closer. It looks to me like aspectrograph indicating metal fatigue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what would you say if I were to tell you that she has nopowers whatsoever? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You think you're going to be killed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Despite your progress, you are a divided society, and so itwill remain until the Gatherers return to Acamar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data is a valued member of my Bridge crew. Based onwhat I've heard, I cannot allow Commander Data to submit himself tothis experiment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We sustained some minor damage. Do you know what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the matter with the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, where else on this planet can I find someone she cannotintimidate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've been monitoring your progress toward warp-drivecapability. When a society reaches your level of technology and isclearly about to initiate warp travel, we feel the time is right forfirst contact. We prefer meeting like this, rather than a randomconfrontation in deep space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To find some privacy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And although Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions,at least Data might listen to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet is not a military organisation. Its purpose isexploration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have an away team on the planet. We are waiting for a windowin the storm to beam them up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments. They're very nearly in perfect condition and yet they're seven hundredyears old. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, centuries ago these North American Indians wereforcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers on DorvanFive originally left Earth more than two hundred years ago in order topreserve their cultural identities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you always accustomed to getting your way, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I want you back aboard this ship. We'll beam you up insuspended animation like the boy. That will give us more time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You needn't. The answer is no. Your actions have been whollycriminal. You will not profit by them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I would like you to make Timothy the best android he canpossibly be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, will you go to Ten forward and keep an eye onData? Don't interfere with his actions unless you hear otherwise fromme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a trap. Comeon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you recognize this planet, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll serve you better here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm delighted that you're feeling better, Captain. The Admiraland I were worried about you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is the Admiral, Karnas. Before he left on this mission, headministered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. Hewanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what thedrug has done to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve yourconscience by offering goods in exchange for our children. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment backhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers Ihave no idea what's underneath. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan was suddenlygoing to announce that he wanted you for his First One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you feeling better? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, for your final mission aboard the Enterprise you willaccompany me to Pentarus Five while I try to sort out the problems withthe miners. Commander Riker has told me you've been studying theeffects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation Law. What betterway to get first hand experience? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe it was all part of the Bynar's programming. But you know,Number One, some relationships just can't work. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By whose calculations? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, stow that with the medical supplies. Keep youreye on it. All right, we're going to explore the cave. Mister Crusher,look for any signs of water, no matter how faint. Captain Dirgo, willyou lead the way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you can help me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So if Palmer, in his delirium, fled into a cave, we may beunable to detect his life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mute main viewer. Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is if you wish me to release him to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief O'Brien, has served with Benjamin Maxwell. Ithought that he might be able to provide some insights. Mister O'Brien, I understand that Captain Maxwell lost his familyduring a raid on an outpost. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you tried synaptic induction? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, protocol may have been lax on your last assignment, buthere on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not something I do easily. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They left together. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You flatter me Professor, but I can't help but wonder whatcould possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of yourstudy. Even in this decade, there are far wiser and more experiencedhumans in and out of Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's turning yellowish. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, she is under the strict guidance of a woman in whom Ihave absolute trust. Ten Forward is the centre of the ship's socialactivity. Everyone on board comes here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So that takes care of the why. Now, what can you do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not unlike much the history of my own planet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait. If that is a Romulan ship, they will read our intent. It'll force them into taking a similar posture. We don't want to engagein battle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: DATA, lock on to the Yamato with a tractor beam. We leavetogether. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in theother two time periods <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, he can't make the journey you're asking of him. You want him to go from contemplating suicide to accepting his condition and living with the disability, but it's too far. The road between covers a lifetime of values, beliefs. He can't do it, Beverly. But perhaps he can come part of the way. Maybe he can be persuaded to forgo the ritual in order to take the chance at regaining the kind of life he needs. A Klingon may not be good at accepting defeat, but he knows all about taking risks. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is it, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how do you explain Starfleet's report that the same testson the Ajax and on the Fearless over there, resulted in ameasurable increase in propulsion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. But his judgment <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Celebrating? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings abouttwo kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Doyou understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back assoon as I can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. I know Hamlet. And what he might said with irony, I saywith conviction. What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason. Howinfinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. Inaction, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed we do. Mister Data, set course for the Neutral Zone. Warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can we help? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're the loneliest person in the world right now. No one cansay anything, no one can do anything that will help. And you think thatit will never go away. And you're right, it won't. But you can get usedto it. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but you can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why would you not bring something so important to the attentionof your own people or the Federation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. If it's energy that you want, we have other waysof providing it. You needn't destroy us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Romulans have returned to this sector we should knowabout that. Mister Worf, any further activity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well that's brilliant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Under attack? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is an emergency. We need warp drive. How long? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the nature of the emergency? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have both allowed this to happen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a difficult choice. You must do what you think best, Data. But whatever decision you make, we will support it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, overlay weapon ranges of the two ships. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can we use the phasers to open a hole in thesphere? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is anything wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's isolate and magnify that system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see howit can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't helpwondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to berepeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannotforesee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for amoment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Establish synchronous orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An escape pod? Then he couldn't have travelled very far. MisterData, are there any other signs of ships in this area? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you bring her back? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've just come from a meeting with AdmiralMoore. He wanted to discuss this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Professor Moriarty has agreed not to interfere withroutine ship operations so long as he believes we're acting in goodfaith, then I don't think we're in immediate danger. Any progress? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down to thosecoordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on yoursignals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign. I understand you're leaving for Starbase Five One Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For the eight hundred years people have been trying to solveit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Moving trilithium resin requires veryspecific equipment. You can't simply improvise something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It will provide you with clothing, food and clean water. Lieutenant Worf demonstrate its operation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come cheer up my lads, 'Tis to glory we steer. To findsomething new in this wonderful year. To honour we call you as free menand brave. For who are so free as the sons of the waves? Hearts of Oakare our ships, Jolly tars are our men. We always are ready. Steady,boys, steady. We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, will you join me in the Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide,Commander Wrightwell, and he said that you were particularly fond ofthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do I? You should never have interfered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of markings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we have no way to prove Mogh's innocence, and Worf willdie as the son of a traitor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not my time. I don't belong here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've injected me with drugs. Surely you must realise thatI've already answered truthfully every question you've put to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Sarek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please keep working at it. We may need it soon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Long range scan, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Wesley? If we go down, I'd like you to join the awayteam to evaluate this world as a place for young people to relax. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Those are Connor and Moira Rossa. They are your parents. Thebaby is you. Jeremiah Rossa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's been in direct contact with the boy for eighteen minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's no bother, Wesley. Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need the transporters to function despite the hyperonicradiation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's say for the moment that may be true. What is the purposeof bringing me here? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aboard a starship, that is not necessary. We are all capable ofexercising self-discipline. Now, you will refrain from using them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, identify humanoid life form in biolab four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I'm not mistaken, she just did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I request a recess. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. Wehumans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never toomuch, never too little, and it's very nice to find a culture that iswilling to take an experience to its furthest extreme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, identify malfunction immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Type R? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that's not the truth? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do we know about them, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, one does not beam down to Starfleet Headquarters armed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our options? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your warning, Prime Minister. We will keep youinformed of our progress. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will speak to the Ambassador about easing your restrictions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's be very observant. Even the mostinsignificant image could be a very important symbol. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can't you enhance the frequency? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are not familiar with the terms of your claim on thissector. We're here engaged in scientific research. Do you wish toparticipate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand down red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. They might think they don't need as much of theircrew to hold the ship. We could use the element of surprise to give usa tactical advantage. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ignite the plasma. That's exactly what they were trying to do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the Cardassians? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You claim you visited this planet a thousand years ago andnegotiated a contract? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff. MisterWorf beat you to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data estimated time to intercept with the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. I'm serving ashost for these proceedings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My apologies. I was unaware that you had not been instructed inthe use of the food dispensers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'msorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it is not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not interfere with Homn's duties this time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge thispower cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energyrelays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one morecharge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate theshuttlecraft's engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are our orders? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would have definite advantages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare for emergency transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said Karnas was a proud man, Admiral,probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation. Is itwise to press him on this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So the anomaly is here too, at Earth. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, scan for a class-M environment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know, and if you're asking me what I think you shoulddo, I don't know that either. I can spell out for you, albeit crudely,what you are choosing between. As the First Officer of the Enterpriseyou have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort. You are the second in command of Starfleet's flagship, but still secondin command. Your promotion will transfer you to a relativelyinsignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy> But itwill be your ship, and being who you are, it will soon be vibrant withyour authority, your style, your vision. You know, there really is nosubstitute for holding the reins. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The time distortion we felt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they were hoping to find someone in Starfleet like you,Admiral, naive enough to solve their Bajoran problem for them. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, he's becoming a very fine officer. He works as hard asany member of the crew. Riker says his studies are on line. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. But there is too much history between the Durasand the Romulans to discount the possibility. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the plasma exploded that would explain a few things. Let meknow when the analysis is complete. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure. Will he leave when he sees there's no other choice? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cycle power through ventral relay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in yourdress uniform for Admiral Quinn's farewell dinner? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, he's no use to us. Finish him now. Let me do it for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can we do to prevent this from happening again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listento your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is therecovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore ourengines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. Ifyou do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to thenearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long timeago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. Iwas talking to Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, don't babble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure that all sciencedepartments have an equal chance of completing their research. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Most of the secondary systems were changed at the lastoverhaul. I don't think they'll give you any problems, but you mightwant to check out the port lateral <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That word demand has a tone of finality. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your vision of Doctor Soong. How is your investigationproceeding? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. I believe we have time to take a closer look, NumberOne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would rather not escalate this situation any further. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tryla Scott. It's said you made Captain faster than anyone inStarfleet history, present company included. Are you that good? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, come on. This is a routine procedure. Quite commonplace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Merde. Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On your feet, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You knowthe effects of your poison. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you tell if it was built by the Borg? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, friends. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to stall Danar. Allow himto think he's succeeding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must be out of my mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you wouldbe demanding equal levels of representation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get the shuttles close enough without danger? Mister LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. Second incommand, Data. Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My staff and I were brought here by an old adversary of minenamed Q, and I'll tell you the rest of that once we're safe. Come, we don't have much time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You believe it's a design flaw? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll hold position while we seek an explanation for theseanomalies. Let's divert all our resources to that end. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you recommend that we proceed? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar? It's your choice, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, yes, speaking as a mother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Ensign, bring us about. Take us out of the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The good news, however, is that the cease fire seems to beholding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then in that case <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You need some rest, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for the nearest starbase. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with mystaff. Stand by for further communications. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge! Stand by to transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fog. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the good ones never get them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for Gagarin Four, warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from thecombat area. Half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laserwelder can be deadly. What's going on in main Engineering? I suggestthat you cooperate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's not from this world. None of us are. We are from a world,we're from a world of fabulous riches. A world where there are objectsfar greater than the one you seek. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it's not important. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Soon we'll both be home. First officer's log, supplemental. On the orders ofCaptain Picard, we have returned to the vicinity of the energy patterncloud. I am personally convinced that something from this cloud nowshares the Captain's mind. But there seems to be nothing we can do, atleast within regulations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Find him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Quite original. How long before a total systems failure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Lock onto their coordinates. Beam them up directly toSickbay. Doctor Crusher, prepare for a Medical Emergency. Two to beamdirectly up to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I haven't heard anything about this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ishara, I wanted to thank you personally for what you did forus down on the colony. It was more than I expected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Am I intruding? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought hereagainst my will. Wherever here is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assemble your away party, Commander. This must be an excitingmoment for you, Mister Data. I'm tempted to lead the away team myself,except that my First Officer would object. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Immediately. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you not see an inherent conflict of interest here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vorin, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Ambassador's very busy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire when ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you had any success, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a few weeks. We have some surveying to do in sector two onethree oh five. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I just received a message from Admiral Nsomeka. She expects youto report in two weeks. A position has opened up in this year's class. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are not invaders. We are explorers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The pleasure of your company is requested,Counsellor. We're having a little impromptu reception for the arrivingdelegates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here he comes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that never gets easier. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'm not surprised. Its sun went nova more than a thousandyears ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we facedeath. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us to impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we transport through the interference? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for the next closest station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We think we've come so far. The torture of heretics, theburning of witches, it's all ancient history. Then, before you canblink an eye, it suddenly threatens to start all over again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which Commander Data is following. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are only so many ways to Ten Forward. Ten Forward is thelogical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll check the fuel consumption logs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn, I said put fusion generators under surge control. You'removing too slowly. Arm the torpedoes, man! Vigo! Get a fire control party up here! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My feelings toward Vash are irrelevant. I would attempt to saveany innocent life, as you well know. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna, your mother might still come out of this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? What instrument? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've got long trip. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I wonder why you're in so much of a hurry. Is thiswoman involved with you in some illegal venture? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will it survive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you think it was? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let them knit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any way I can? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were found in crates marked Medical Supplies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And is it the same situation if it's an epidemic, and not ageological calamity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will continue with Riker as Captain. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about thecrew. How are they reacting to our sudden change in course? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then do it. It seems we have no alternative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of here, Mister Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what I told him. But we have to be careful. Obviouslyit's easy for people to misunderstand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. During my sophomore year, I was assigned to trainingon Morikin Seven. Well, there was a Nausicaan outpost on one of theoutlying asteroids, and one day <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Then explain the fractured ribs, concussion, the broken arm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The pain's gone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. It would put the Federation in a very difficultposition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. Wehave engaged the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps my Chief Engineer could be of assistance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready, but hold on ready. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: According to the laws of physics, this is impossible. We wouldhave no idea how to do it again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Success, Mister Conor. With the upgrades to your biosphere, thecore fragment should no longer be a danger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhapsyou and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are hereby requested and required torelinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, CommandingOfficer Cairo, as of this date. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay away from her, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, programme the computer to analyse the distribution ofthe pieces that we have, correcting for changes in star configurationsover four billion years, then extrapolate for the missing piece. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then she has done us both a disservice. I am committed topeace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard. To whom am I speaking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to get under way as soon as possible. Thesituation on Garadius Four is becoming serious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I don't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Always. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker, with the peace delegates and all, I think I do need arest. Take charge, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Commander, we have recovered one of your survivors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Violate the Prime Directive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But this is not the present I remember. You said nothing wouldchange. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, if you've come here for sanction to take matters intoyour own hands, I can't give it to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try them again. Boost the signal strength. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would appreciate it if we could discuss it now. You see, Ifeel that I would like to move beyond astrophysics to Engineering orSecurity, something that might even lead to Command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analyse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do they mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us back, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's an herbal tea blend. I, er, found it in the replicatorfiles. Have you met any of the new crewmembers who came aboard atStarbase two eighteen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I promise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In the interim, the Academy's loss is our gain. The Enterprisewill continue to benefit from your talents for another year. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And then watch what happens. Captain's log, supplemental. I have becomeconvinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy. I am hopefulthe purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I should meet with this Acost Jared. He's still ourbest hope for the release of the hostages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you come here. There's something I want to show you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I noticed that too, Counsellor. I had the distinct impressionof in the presence of a flim-flam artist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I got the days confused. I thought it was Tuesday when itwas Wednesday. I went to the Cafe Moulin instead of the Cafe desArtistes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I think this charade has gone far enough. Don'tyou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Radue, this is Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want all departments prepared for a warpsix trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team completes itsmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You had the full tour, I trust? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll try and put an end to this fromhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, begin a phase one search, starting with theshuttlecraft's last known coordinates. Plot a proximity course towardthe star. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, full. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The experiment achieved a stable coretemperature for a short time, Minister. That's a significant stepforward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Intact, for the most part. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Activate your viewscreen. I would likeyou to monitor what's going on up here. I may need your input. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we detect this before now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number three sixnine B. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Korgano? Who is that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the bad news? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Your daughter has explained your telepathic ability. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood, Commander. Keep us informed of your efforts. Picardout. I'll be in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna! Anna! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And mine, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reactions? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take theRomulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Poison? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reassemble in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can scarcely believe it myself, but I am so grateful for yourpresence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But what about your wishes, your needs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have no right to put us through this just to satisfy yourcuriosity. 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Trust requires time and experience. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what the hell is this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was murdered. Poisoned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, is it absolutely necessary to see the medical files toattempt treatment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me aship with children aboard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inexcusable. You defied the orders of theranking officer on the scene. You put the lives of the entire away teamin jeopardy, and you made an already tense situation worse. Youractions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform. Now, Iwant an explanation, Mister Crusher, and I want it now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do Iask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday onCorsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of athousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believethat if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is myfuture and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And a wonderful job you did of it, too. Well, later thisafternoon, we're going to finish the tour I promised you, starting withthe battle bridge. I'll see you at fourteen hundred hours. You have theBridge, Number One. + <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was a little surprised at the decision to put a base in forceso close to the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, set course for Loren Three, maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, am I interrupting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't trust you, Q. Why should I expect Amanda to? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you havebrought my ship and my crew into great risk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that, Data. Look, I realise you've been studying thehuman equation with great alacrity, but perhaps you've been working atit too much. Don't try so hard to be human. Just be yourself. Allright? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they'restill together, how far could they have travelled in three hours? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you've come here because of the legend about planet Havenmiraculously healing the sick. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which means, of course <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option. Proceed, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, that's the second of your criteria. Let's deal with thefirst, intelligence. Is Commander Data intelligent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As are we, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't rendezvous with the Havana for another two days. That'll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it a life form, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and who she ischanges the moment the next mancomes into the room.  And I find myself hoping that the nextman won't come in. But, ofcourse, he does, and in a few hours, the ceremony will begin and shewill mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than hecares about her. And I can't help thinking how she will be with him. How she will change to accommodate him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Mister McDowell. I'll be at the service inTen Forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we must hurry or we'll missCommander Riker's party. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure your fellow Q remember you agreed to never trouble ourspecies again. Just as they're aware you failed to tempt a human tojoin you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Wait. The plan failed because clues were left behind thatsuggested a mystery. And to many humans, a mystery isirresistible. It must be solved. The Doctor's incubation experiment,Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations. Little pieces of evidence thatsuggested even more clues. The clock, the transporter trace, Data's oddbehaviour. If we eliminate the clues and begin again <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian armaments. Data, especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges, wherever applicable,durability, composition, weaknesses of material. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened back there, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have afew years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do notwant to be patronised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there myresponsibility ends, but you, you have to stay with them through theentire grieving process. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you are who you say you are, then you have nothing to lose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that thefamily would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, butyou've interfered in the burial rituals of another culture. You've putboth of us in a very difficult position. The family will have to benotified. I don't doubt that they will react strongly. If the Ferengigovernment becomes involved, as I'm certain they will, this could havevery significant repercussions. I'm not sure how much I can protectyou. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, there's nothing about you I find tantalising. On thecontrary, I find you obvious and vulgar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your preparations made the negotiations simple, Ambassador, andKamala was able to guide me through the rituals. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about Durken? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I can't do that either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Bringloidi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have some brandytogether. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might haveshared our kind of values. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, due to the delicate nature of these negotiations, allparties have agreed that one representative would suffice. Now I willbe happy to provide your consuls with accommodations and you may havemy chair. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. That puts me in a difficult position. I promised toescort these people to their camps. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Clark, we are barely able maintain communication withyou. Can you boost the level of your power source? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth toinvestigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, I want you to stop this experiment for now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've declared war on our way of life. We are to beassimilated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriouslydamaging their ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, very well. I will monitor your progress from here. Butjust remember, ten minutes, no more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, thank you. New orders from Starfleet. The rendezvous. Nothing, thank you. The rendezvous with the Goddard hasbeen postponed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka is taking over my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, is there any way that the Enterprise couldcoax that satellite <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll deal with the repercussions later. We must knowwhat you want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then take us to the outer cometary cloud, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get us to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive,and until that is changed there is no further course of action that wecan take. Is that understood? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan warbird, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theFederation vessel Enterprise. You have crossed into the Neutral Zoneand are engaged in hostile action. Explain yourself and your intent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run itscourse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: See if you can contact the colony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How would they react? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Therefore you see this armed raid as the only option. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're excused, crewman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, this is Captain Picard. Will you beam theFerengi directly to the Observation lounge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know what business they might have together? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, estimate the time from this location to Starbase fourone six at warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How strong are your shields, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wasn't. I was a puerile adolescent who allowed himself to beled by his hormones instead of his head. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The challenge, Mister Offenhouse, is to improve yourself. Toenrich yourself. Enjoy it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mister Data,what kind of cake is this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I look forward to sampling them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will deal with Mister Data at another time. Meanwhile, I willhave to write this incident into your permanent record. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker wrote those reports. He agrees with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead and beam your passengers onboard. Counsellor, after you've seen to their needs will you escortthem to my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll take care. Find out what you can, then join me, in forceif necessary. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. I want him kept under constant surveillance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Also becomes a reality. We must,therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Belay that. Computer, estimated arrival at Pegos Minor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Speed, warp five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How fast is the wave travelling now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't you think you both might be overreacting? Data is notcapable of the emotions which you are assigning to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not yet. But you will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're ina position to compromise the security of the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There should be room for both in this life. And what about you,you old rascal. You've taken quite a shift into the future yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must consider all options, Doctor, and not let our personalfeelings impede our judgment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am aware of the risks, Ensign. When the umbilical splits, weshould regain primary control, do you agree? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Acceptable risks, justified risks, but I can't acceptthis. It's unjustified. It's unfair. He has rights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf will escort you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we go to warp? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There was no opportunity. There was no pause. He just kept talking in one long, incredibly unbroken sentence, movingfrom topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt. It wasreally quite hypnotic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is no longer a matter of how wrong Datawas, or why he did it. The dilemma exists. We have to discuss theoptions. And please talk freely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's no way out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which goes <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And it's your belief that this is what made it possible forthem to construct this base to Starfleet standards? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The transceivers. Lorin said that they would align themselvesto our psi-wave patterns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is hard to believe in what one cannot see. And yetconceivably, with their cloaking technology, a fleet of Romulanwarships could be passing before our eyes. There must be some way toneutralise this advantage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Easily? Oh no, not easily. We handle it because we're trainedto, as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But if the time ever comeswhen the death of a single individual fails to move us <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And from that point we have been existing in a holodecksimulation created by Professor Moriarty? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems we're looking a unique phenomenon. One that hasn'tbeen recorded before. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Needless to say, I've not succeeded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meribor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course to intercept the Cardassians. MisterWorf, open a channel to the Bajoran vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related towhat's happening? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You disobeyed my direct order. You putyourself in grave danger. I am not happy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You feel the Hathaway has value? We deny you your prize. Fire! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's put all this together. Lieutenant Worf, multiple image,full conference mode. Let them all see each other. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, override the shuttle's computer. Return it to theshuttlebay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You too, Doctor. I have business with the Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, my reputation as a litigator, not to mentionmy immortal soul, is in serious jeopardy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look at him. He's a different person. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a joke, Corey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it trying to learn? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which explains why Data could be left outside in no danger fromthat creature. Whatever happened to the colonists, he would be found bythe first Starfleet crew that responded to the signal he transmitted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red Alert! All crew to battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can recognise the inscription pattern from the firstartefact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is everyone else all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can youunderstand what it is that <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other wayto scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in anormal sensor sweep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have made a very serious accusation. Iwant you to explain it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beam them back immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perrin. Amanda. I wanted to give you so much more. I wanted toshow you such tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock, Amanda, didyou know? Perrin, can you know how much I love you? I do love you! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now Idon't think I have any other choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why so slow? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm convinced that Q isn't telling us everything. See what youcan find out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, wait. Stop. There was someone else in the shuttlecraft withme. The pilot, he's injured. He needs your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Let her go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Daedalus class. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Temba is a person? His arms wide. Because he's holding themapart in, in generosity. In giving. In taking. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker and I will stay on board, be available shouldyou need us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concernshere. What you don't understand is that <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan. Lookthis isn't a Romulan labour camp. I don't have to answer yourquestions. And I don't give a damn what you think. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, to me it's just an undefined form,standing in a visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneousinformation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Well, the first step is to find out why theEnterprise was transferring power to the Romulan ship. I think we should begin our search in the Romulan engine room. Counsellor, you spent several days on a Romulan vessel. You probablyknow more about the layouts than anyone here. Perhaps <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, I ask you to put and end to this before someone gets hurt. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. There's just one last thing you can do for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. You're right, Number One. It's a task that I willattend to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room! Is Commander Riker aboard? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can believe what you wish. We will be on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What else have you found out? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out. Manoeuvring thrusters only. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't listen to him, Gloria. He's lying. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Progress, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you remember anything else? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomalysomehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I want an explanationPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That happens to be why I came to Risa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi had the good sense to ask for shore leave. Ican see I'm going to have to suggest it to you. Have a good time,Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I insist. When you've finished showing the Admiralanything that he needs, you can join me down on Earth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Gowron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Barre, France. Captain's log, stardate 46360.8. The negotiationswith the Cardassians have made little progress. I believe a militaryconfrontation may be unavoidable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are not here as conquerors, Chancellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have been in contact with Admiral Kennelly during thismission? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Sarek. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, will you at least allow me to <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So the entire ship has been affected. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historicalparallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homesbecause of a political decision that has been taken by a distantgovernment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doesn't he deserve to become more than that? His true heritageis human, Endar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He said he wanted to be alone. Perhaps it's a bigger moment forhim than we thought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's begin with you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm very pleased to hear that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, we don't have time for that. We've encountered a minormystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Number One,unless there's a major objection, then Ensign McKnight should put usback on course for Evadne Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive. See if youcan find some way to access it. And in the meantime, I'll see what Ican learn from these people inside Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The interval between radiation bursts. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's go see if we can find them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirtyfour, thirty five, and thirty six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So how do we cut the puppet's strings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please identify yourselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, can you tap into their computer and clarify thesituation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. Nelson toured the Victory beforeTrafalgar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get within transporter range without crossing intoCardassian territory? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What precipitated the attack? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Garrett, damage report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you must unconditionally surrender. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Matter of internal security. The age-old cry of the oppressor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we ever needed reminding of the importance of the PrimeDirective, it is now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that you're willing to go to war over this boy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Command considers Graves' work on molecularcybernetics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priorityone action. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's the study of fossil records at the microscopic level. I read your papers on the subject, but that was years ago. It seemed asthough the work had stopped. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They willaccept no one else. How can we confirm your diagnosis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full cooperation, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I get the feeling from your mother that you have something totell me. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Interesting relationship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I shall need you. You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you ease the pain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good guess. You're quicker than Starbase research. It took themhours to determine this was a distress beacon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forty five years ago he made the wrong decision. He wanted tocome here to somehow right it, to atone for what he did. Now all he cando is to give himself up to you. He brought this retribution onhimself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's hard to believe that he could rise to the rank of SenateProconsul without the support of the Romulan traditionalists. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, why don't you show the Commander to her quarters? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us back on a course <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Although an object appears solid on the holodeck, in the realworld they have no substance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A few hours on board and already she's found Ten forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Use caution, but protect Graves' health <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security to Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When he's finished we'll have to move away and make it looklike we've scanned the asteroid but haven't find anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good morning, Batai. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, it took five men to restrain him and he took aparthalf of the Transporter Room in the process. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember a Starfleet admiral once saying the same thing aboutsome renegade Andorians in the Triangulum system. It turns out thatthey had dismantled their ship and hidden it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's general policy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My Aunt Adele cured a lot of sleeplessnights with this steamed milk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thanks to the two of you, the way has been paved for furtherrescue operations. N'Vek's efforts, and his sacrifice, were not in vain. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: I suppose I could find a few hours to spend on the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Humans can't survive in that environment. Exposure to hyperonicradiation is fatal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impossible. My culture is based on freedom and selfdetermination. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you will have to find evidence some way other than anautopsy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see them, don't you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The next time the Enterprise appears, go through it with Data. Geordi will be able to learn from him. Maybe help him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create somevery challenging climbs. We could go down together and I could show youhow to use theprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goodnight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I want Lieutenant Worf to accompany you. Getme a full report on the prospects of getting our shields back. NumberOne, Mister Data, will you join me in the conference room as soon aspossible. It's time to discuss the future of this mission, if therestill is one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He said he needed more time. He was upset by our early arrival. But in fact I maintain he already had made that breakthrough and thathe was lying to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prognosis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely you wish to live like the rest of us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll talk to her about it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think that we attacked your outposts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, the colonists are not going to be happy about that. Someof them have been there for decades. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering, can we transfer auxiliary power to thewarp nacelles? Try to break us out by using the <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Debin, hold this position. Viewer off. Data, identify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to keep it up long enough for Commander Riker to get tous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No need, Number One. Mister Remmick's presence is unnerving, tosay the least. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dead ahead. Impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, do you know what year this is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These officers are here to assist you. Not judge, help you. Youshould make use of them. They are a valuable resource. And by the way,I respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask aquestion, rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindlyforward. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a discussion. You're restricted to your quartersfor the remainder of this mission. Dismissed. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You could tell them that in order to get past the check points,they're shipping the components for these weapons through thirdparties, and then we could put together a convoy and send it toward theDemilitarised Zone. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was Ensign WesleyCrusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer onlyspecific charges. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have the luxury to speculate. Back us away from thedistortion, Ensign. One half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do nothing that he asks. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, I think there are some things of which you should bemade aware. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is not my intention to interfere. Only to help you andRishon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Visions? Do you mean dreams? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, we've done everything that we can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. Now, we'll seewhat they have in mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you're looking at me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did he have anything to say about this attack? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. Run Riker programme two, time code, sixteenone zero. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are our rather quarrelsome guests? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think we are in danger from this plague? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How could this happen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Commander. Minister, we're here in friendship,hoping to provide assistance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Medical Lab on main viewer. Let's use this calm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for awoman and child. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She has your full confidence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. When can that be arranged? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, what is the time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well there should be no problem about our entering orbit. Iasked Commander Riker to contact the Vulcan authorities from theEnterprise and let them know that we were approaching. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, perhaps you'd better go along as well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done. I'm going to be fine. I just need to get my breath. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's wrong, Commander? You having second thoughts aboutbetraying your comrades? Because that's what you've done, betrayedthem. Betrayed them in order to save yourself. You used to be just asecond rate officer, now you're a traitor and a coward. How does thatfeel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I do not deserve it. Look at me. Look at me. Feel the warmth ofmy hand, the rhythm of my pulse. I'm not a supreme being. I'm flesh andblood, like you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. I visited there twelve years ago, while commanding theStargazer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can have full use ofthe ship's computer to set up a comm. link and upload your data fromhere. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is the Captain! Computer, identify exit! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. Mister Worf, keep a close eye on Q's friends outthere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Seal off deck six. Activate security fields sections twentythree through twenty nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Force field down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's quite all right. It must be important, or you wouldn't behere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Delightful. Tell me, why is the corridor so quiet? The lasttime I was here, it was bustling with activity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I suppose I had better get a case. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good, Mister Data. Now we know where he's headed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, we no longer have a choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'd rather just observe, if you don't mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Harm has already come to them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I, er, what's our ETA? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Invite him, Mister Data. This is supposed to be a recreationalactivity. The sense of reality was absolutely incredible. When thatwoman kissed me, it was so <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, stay with them in Jeremy's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but if this is an accurate representation, it couldexplain what happened in that system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation, of a Federation starship. Standby to receive emergencyteams. Commander, we will handle this one step at a time. Stabilisetheir power systems and tend to their injured, and avoid alldiscussions of where and when they are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Commander Riker tojoin me as soon as he's ready. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were never considered a danger to us, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Which iswhy Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically indiscipline <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the next step, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, you've never known fear, Data. But as an acute observerof behaviour, you should be able to approximate it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds delightful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka. He seemedeager for his fate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid we're going to have to take a look in your vessel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's modifying the emitter diode to project something. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what youneeded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, I'd like you tomonitor our velocity closely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anyone on Romulus he might know, or choose to contact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She is trying to put an end to all that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll wait here for months if necessary. We're just considering options. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's quite difficult. The anguish of the man, the despairpouring out of him, all those feelings, the regrets. I can't stop them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've got to find some way to stop this system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Coordinate your analysis with Mister La Forge. I want thisreport with dispatch. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this the forty six? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek assured me that they had stopped that practice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, Mister Worf, as you're aware, several new securityofficers will be transferring to the Enterprise next week and I wouldlike to discuss. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, but it may be enough to turn us into orbit, hold ourdistance from the photosphere. Ensign, port thrusters ahead full,starboard thrusters back full. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. The question is, who? I can't believe it's one ofour people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand that you'll be serving on board the Bortas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can't you just turn on the kid's computer in schoolroomeight? We just want to play a few games. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then let us hope they do not believe their survival is atstake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the planetary collision? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Doctor. Your next task is clear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Between intelligent species of good will <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you're taking on Riker this time. Excellent. He'll defeatyou just as I did. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: From where? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take care, Uncle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, but her inertia will carry the Stargazer along with us. Ordid you sleep through the Academy lecture on conservation of tractorbeam power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small andinsignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell are you doing in my room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, I require your presence on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I don't think so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, please, Mister Worf, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to himnow? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before I begin to change? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sound familiar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some planet? What are you doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a few hours, I'll be turning him over to the Angosians, andI'll be happy to do it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Corey, there's got to be a better way to handle this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. It is your dishonour we are protecting here, isn't it,Duras? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's delicious. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously, he's trying to alter the programming here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me a visual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I would like you to accompany Captain Scott. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know how busy you are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Somebody? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can search it twice as fast if we separate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf must have overridden the sensor codes, played someholographic games. Mister Data, input a new code. Attack posture, circumvental attitude. Prepare beams for photon mode. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I apologise for the delay in our arrival,Ambassador Briam. We had to stop at Harod Four to pick up a group ofstranded miners. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Human. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are hereby requested and required to take command <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek, we're a part of each other. I know that he has causedyou pain but I also know that you love him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate a metallurgical analysis of the ship's hull. Subspacefield incursions may have left a trace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck seven. Picard to Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, youknow as well as I do I would never have graduated if you <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, assemble the rest of your away team. Prepare forimmediate rescue operations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has not regained consciousness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Successful? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, override its destination. Divert that turbolift to aposition near Lieutenant Worf's present location. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that won't be known until combat begins. You're right,Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, wecould overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so I canget a power boost? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She gave me no choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know who it is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know full well I hadn't even met Beverly then. Youintroduced them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This wouldn't quench your thirst, it would make it worse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That thought had passed through my mind, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report back to the ship when you're ready, Commander. Doctor,we'll stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances,but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For what reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I growup again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybefifteen years. The question is what to do until then? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's just hold this position. Counsellor? You have said yousensed no intelligence in all of this. You haven't changed in thatbelief? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Counsellor, how's the boy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't go that far. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put a repeating message on all subspace channels. Order theLieutenant to come about and stand to. Make it a priority onecommuniqué. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Audio on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you meet Commander Data on the Bridge. He has our ordersand new heading. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, any heading, warp six. Now! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Lwaxana, it is something of a rather delicatesituation> It's the first real contact with a rather reclusiverace, and this is in the nature of an official greeting, so <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data is my Second Officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I, er, I don't know where to begin. It was <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A strategy, with fist open. With fist open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm not taking it lightly. I'm just trying to be as dull aspossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan. Please, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life forms indicated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently so. How long were we unconscious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you surprised to see me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did they show any interest in assimilating you or yourtechnology? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And it was believed that the last Tarellian vessel wasdestroyed eight years ago by the Alcyones. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the Acamar system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, find out if anything similar happened in thissector. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're right, of course. Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will youescort her to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You stay here. Keep warm. I'll go and look for her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put this on the main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It sounds delightful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, perhaps it would be best if you were to confineyourself to Sickbay until we arrive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Override. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first. I mustsee them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bensen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No, no, no, no. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you have the helm. I'll be inEngineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you escort the Minister to the transporterroom? Chancellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them on upper and lower band frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And just what location are they accepted from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, what is the time right now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew that you werestill alive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Like this hearing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not anything now, Number One. I'm just a man who's lookingfor answers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's your signal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wouldn't that be a little obvious, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that so? Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez, I think it will besimpler if I simply change my uniform. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin long range scans of the Romulan border. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, unlike King Henry, it is not easy for me to disguisemyself and walk among my troops. That'll be all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign Gates? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to find some way to undo what he has done so that wecan regain control of this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, this is Captain Picard of the starshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you believe he's using the same tactic now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cadet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign, take us out of orbit. Set a course for thePhelan system, warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Structural status, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to warp eight point nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, set in warp one point five,retroactive course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard theEnterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why is that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you this is an informal inquiry. We are not accusingyou of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be providedfor you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, you are arguing for a man who may have murdered yourson. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Er, yes, a long time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. And I want a level four security alert. I needto know if anyone comes on or off this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How soon will you be ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of theuniverse strikes me as being hollow, Q. I see no evidence that you areguided by a superior moral code, or any code whatsoever. You may benearly omnipotent, and I don't deny that your parlour tricks are veryimpressive, but morality? I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it, Q. Iwould put human morality against the Q's any day. And perhaps that'sthe reason that we fascinate you so. Because our puny behaviour showsyou a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence, a moralcentre. And if so, I can think of no crueller irony than that youshould destroy this young woman, whose only crime is that she's toohuman. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've beentracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It'slike following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here andstopped, which is what I knew would interest you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever it is, why do you demonstrate it through thisconfrontation? Why not a simple, direct explanation, a statement ofwhat you seek? Why these games? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do we bypass the security system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're saying that when our time intersects with the time heleft, in that instant he will function normally and, and there will betwo of us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, Mister La Forge. We're going to execute a nearwarp <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they willing to leave? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel is approaching. It will be herewithin three hours. We can return you to the crash site, where theywill find you and take then you home. Or, if you wish, you can stayhere with us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not Gregory Quinn. It may look likehim and sound like him, but it isn't him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involvedin the negotiations as your representative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I ask, Ambassador, what has this to do with us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's see if they'll answer our hail now, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is enough, Ensign. When addressing a senior officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kahlest, would they recognise you? Would they know who yourare? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You seem rather taken with her, JP. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bags of mostly water? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep monitoring their approach. Repeat the hail every half anhour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'mpec! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain, we're beaming over a replacement coil. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to have a word with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, Counsellor, Doctor. John, I want you to joinus. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. Mister Worf stay at Tactical. Counter any moves the Zalkonian makes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Before you wake them up, I want to have Security here. Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good? Data, isn't good and bad, right and wrong, a function ofyour ethicalprogramme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way? Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You heard me, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Borg ship will enter orbit in one hour. You'll soon be headed home. We'll beam him down and then we'll take upa position in the star's chromosphere. The interference will hide usfrom their sensors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll fill you in later. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course, Doctor. Sit down. Counsellor. Commander La Forge isattempting repairs even as we speak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You and I need to have a little chat about that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Situations like these are never easy, Number One. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return environmental conditions to normal, Mister Data. Move inyour security teams, Mister Worf. WORF <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something to be carefully avoided. I agree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker, can you read me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, we're approaching the Idini StarCluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to initiate warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That may not be entirely true, Professor. This which we callthe holodeck uses a principle similar to another device called atransporter. In the year in which we live, humans have discovered thatenergy and matter are interchangeable. In the holodeck, energy isconverted to matter. Thus you have substance. But only here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, put the planet on the main viewer. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me try to explain. I am by no means embarrassed by yourpresence here. On the contrary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We? For whom else do you speak? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I tend to agree, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousandyears ago. Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his societyat hand and he conceived this Contract of Ardra to motivate change. Ormaybe there was an Ardra of some sort who is the basis of thismythology. Who knows? The point is that somehow a fundamental theologywas created which transformed this society, but in the process ofchange, created this latent fear which has been passed down throughgenerations. Data, from your own experience of performing EbenezerScrooge, you're aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. Then report to Mister Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp without warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which would suggest what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm simply considering all possibilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But why bring such a powerful weapon into the past? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is verydistracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and weresolve this face to face. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, he's certainly not what I would expect. Without cause orreason, he and his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centreand transfer all available power to the shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? Because it offends against our sensibilities? It is notour mission to impose Federation or Earth values on any others in thegalaxy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Set a course for those stars, warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For what purpose? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, this is the Enterprise. Come in please. Over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he dead? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The imaging logs? Are you suggesting that you have evidence theCardassians have tampered with the Array? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound there was noway to stop it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. Robin Hood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I will be forced to remove you by whatever means arenecessary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There it is. SS Mariposa, loaded 27th November, 2123. Destination Ficus sector. Captain Walter Granger, commanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explains what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Allenby, full stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you were a member of my crew, sir, I would <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Options, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this what you've done to Counsellor Troi? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've obviously brought a very dangerouslife form aboard this ship. I want to minimize the chances of anyincident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But what if she doesn't want that future? It must be herdecision. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We would require no special attention. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Number One. The Sheliak haven't broken a century of silenceto send us after phantoms. An investigation is in order. Set course forTau Cygna Five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you certain? Yes, of course you are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it? Computer, run Tayna programme four, time index eighteenone four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over asCommandant, Starfleet Academy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you are wrong, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, I do need to get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm just thinking that I'm saying goodbye to you as you aretoday. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide,here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gasto form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of thesun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Or a lover, perhaps? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on, stay with me. Come on now, stay awake. That's anorder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then shall we continue with our mission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get me the Sheliak. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would be risky to set a trap here, so close to Federationspace. But the fact remains, here we are, there is no freighter. Didyour contact tell you anything else that might be helpful? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Ambassador is sceptical, but he cares agreat deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success,he's prepared to pursue it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, are there other people on this planet? How long have youbeen here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we'll proceed to Farpoint. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Apgar, you understand the purpose of this hearing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half of theirplanet to the Federation while leaving the other half out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The transfer went well? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything you'd like to say before we begin, NumberOne? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No matter how tempted? No matter how difficult Q makes it foryou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How serious is their condition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before the power drain becomescritical, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? What is the source of that risk? The energy field? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't miss this for the world. How oldare you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Belay that order. There will be no further communication offthis ship without my prior authorisation. Commander, may I have a wordwith you? Mister Data, you have the bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That'll have to wait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You requested this posting? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just explain what brought us here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I couldn't leave the Enterprise. But the offer raised in mecertain feelings of regret. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to biolab four. Alexander, can you hear us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was thinking about it, but I didn't say anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can assure you, Ambassador, the Federation would neverinterfere in the internal affairs of the Empire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any indications of life, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Metaphysics? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any indications of weapons or vesselsbeneath the surface? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'm in good company, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it didn't end there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right, what's the next step? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you for your concern. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why was there a power drain beforetransport? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So he did, but don't depend too much on any single viewpoint Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, that would be more in character, wouldn't it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was a different person in those days. Arrogant,undisciplined, with far too much ego and too little wisdom. I was morelike you. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Number One, those big clamps are part of theemergency system. If something goes wrong, they're designed to hold theturbolift in place. But it would seem that they're damaged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North AmericanIndians settled? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That was Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign. Please follow hisinstructions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not an away team, Commander. I consider this aceremonial function. For me not to go could be construed as lack ofinterest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know the story from Vulcan mythology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not at all. That's the last thing I would do. You, bydefinition, are part of our charter. Our mission is to go forth to seekout new and different life forms, and you certainly qualify as one ofthe most unique I've ever encountered. To learn about you is, frankly,provocative. But you're next of kin to chaos. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain's log, supplemental. It has beenthree days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contactwith Radue since then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And so the earlier probe was responsible for the Yamato'sdestruction? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't open this door. We're going to have to climb up to thenext deck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you'remistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocentbecause you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasantemotions. Well, this time you will be held accountable. I'm taking youback to the Enterprise to release Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wonder. But the point of this is, whether you and it haveapproximately the same capabilities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you believe there is a threat to the Federation in thisstruggle? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? Or what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. Captain's log, stardate 41464.8. I have declared anindefinite quarantine for Velara Three, and we are now returning toStarbase with the three surviving terraformers. Perhaps the lesson wehave learned from this near tragedy will prevent it from happeningelsewhere. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Patterson, you're an officer. You have to obey orders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Ambassador, I will ask our Chief Security officer,Lieutenant Worf, to make a report <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, move us in closer. This is the Captain. Wewill be pushing the shields to the limit, but we are getting asplendid view of this phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There are disturbing overtones in the ideaof a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware ofany other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might haveencountered recently? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a way, I wish he'd never come on board the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil is going on here, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have completed our survey on the surface. Analysing thatdata will keep us busy for a while. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not very good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it's worse than that. My guess is this refining processof which you are so proud <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if she really is Q, she must understand what that means. Very well, I will introduce you. But we cannot argue like this in frontof her. We must at least appear to be Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume previous course, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've assigned you quarters during out time here. Please, makeyourselves comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arrogant? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Enterprise. With all this interference it isdifficult to copy your transmission. If you all talk at once it isalmost impossible. Now, please say again. What is your situation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But they could just as easily have shot her where she stood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We learn as much as possible about a planet before we makefirst contact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister Sabin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam thechildren up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind usthan I am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you tried reconfiguring the plasmaconduits? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive action, delta sequence. Ready phasers, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a veryimportant mission. A mission that could put you in a situation thatwould be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commandingofficer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And because the subspace wave would appear simply as backgroundradiation, no one would realise what was happening until it was toolate. Now, for the past few weeks, theta-band subspace emissions havebeen detected coming from Celtris Three. Those emissions may indicatethat a metagenic delivery system in operation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And even to reverse death itself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, but if Solok were to go to Celtris Three for legitimatereasons, we would be interested in quietly booking passage for thejourney. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what do you hope to accomplish? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, before we lose contact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the Romulans are suddenly very interestedin bonding with the Vulcans. Spock has been meeting with the new SenateProconsul about reunification. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Since Professor Moriarty never actually left the holodeck, hemay demand that Commander Riker help him to do so. How long until theplanetary collision? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll can talk about it later. For now, I think we shouldget off this planet. Am I in assuming the damage the shuttle is not asbad as it seems? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of 'Demons of Air andDarkness'. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transfer emergency power to the antimattercontainment system! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication of a more conciliatory attitude ontheir part? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Number One, as soon as Data is ready, I want you tolead an away team. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Ian, I don't think I've played with puppies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make a full scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. Hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, you need help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They've given away their humanity with this geneticmanipulation. Many of the qualities that they breed out, theuncertainty, the self-discovery, the unknown, those are many of thequalities that make life worth living. Well, at least to me. I wouldn't want to live knowing that my future was written, that myboundaries had been already set, would you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're on board the starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's your situation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How convenient. Except, Number One, I have absolutely nointention of taking a holiday. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, not a matter of great moment, just a knot I had to untie. So, what do you want to see me about? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take the conn position. Engineering, this is theBridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's an excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the Bridge,Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are outrageous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why is that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell them the human who destroyed their comrades is here andwishes to address them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion almostin our current course. There's a small object back there that wasn'tthere a few moments ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have tractor beams standing by. We may have totake them under tow. Helm, take us within tractor range. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I entirely agree with you, Number One. It's not the time. But the time may come when we will be required to take greater risks. Iwant you to consider her plan as a fall back position. Make thenecessary preparations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I asked you, what is this place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let's just say I've heard rumours that the Uthat islocated somewhere on Risa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. It is important that you trust us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A spider? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what the hell is going on here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful andbenevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: His eyes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive, Mister Crusher. Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. More fundamental doubts. Whether or not it can bejustified. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan, your people have been in this part of the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quartersimpulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is hardly a scientific observation, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were taking her to places that were inappropriate, evendangerous. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and protecther. And we have to keep on working on the retrovirus. If we coulddistract him, if we could lure him away from her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surelythere are others who are better suited. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have your orders, Commander. And I expect you to followthem. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it reversible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're telling me this is another computer glitch? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Things are only impossible until they're not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me. Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, please take command ofthe ship until further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage tractor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, we will all be serving together. Commander Rikerand I have expectations of you. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent theCommander to me when he's finished. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Knowing where the flaw is located, can you isolate the problemand solve it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And deadly. I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Into living plants? How is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroy the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just half an hour ago he was crying like a baby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Comment is invited. Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If an apology will do, then I offer it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha died, a year before you came on the Enterprise. You nevermet her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And Data, will you leave your hesitation and self-doubt here inyour quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not smugness, not arrogance. But we are resolute, we aredetermined, and your help is not required. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened to the shuttlecraft, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you each bring your samples on board the Enterprise, I willcombine them with ours. And then we will all observe the resultssimultaneously, giving no one the advantage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would log that agreement as promising, at least. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready photon torpedoes. BURKE <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section athigh warp velocity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Negative <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I wish you and your people well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I'd like a word with CommanderLa Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm willing to entertain suggestions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Picard toCommander Riker, answer please. Computer, locate Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In five days, you have seen only the most superficial evidenceof what life is like outside this biosphere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then the Uthat actually exists? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room one, can you lock onPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set in a course for the Vilmoran System. Warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet has sent a message asking us to proceed to the Phelansystem to negotiate a trade agreement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you learn that from Commander Data as well? I shall have tohave a talk with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very good. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which teams are missing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. And Manheim's experiments with gravity and time wererudimentary, and uncontrollable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now access the file. Start the transfer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive andit must stop. You have kept information from me since our firstcommunication. An alien life form has taken possession of my MedicalLab. You knew of its existence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impulse engines. Ahead, minimum power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Rotate heading in five degree increments. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before it loses integrity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes! Right. That's it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss theBradbury. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course three one markseven three. Present minimalaspect. Ready warp one,optimal spread on simulatedtorpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, assemble the senior staff and goto Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Paxans. Who are they? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to samplea variety of dishes, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Obviously, they did not expect and never wanted this challenge. You're getting close to something, Lieutenant. Something they care agreat deal about protecting. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon aswe're on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My hand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's that obvious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran that I'm working as fast as I can. What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Strange. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What problem is that, DaiMon Bok? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then T'Jon, and Romas, indeed everyone on their world? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But can they be removed from the hull? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any connection between that structure and the shipfragment we found? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, I order you to relax. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, it seems clear that your husband was motivated toearn the kind of rewards that pleased you, Mrs. Apgar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard theEnterprise again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But. Damn it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Wesley. You remember I was always proud of you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are hounding an innocent man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, we have been experiencing a few minor difficultieswith our new warp core, but my Chief Engineer assures me that we willbe under way within the hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is someone there? Who's there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker conducts masterclasses in poker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, Are our problems likely to attain theseriousness of those on the Yamato? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And when I looked down into the street, Iactually saw automobiles! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to offer a proposal. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You didn't say you could do that. Affirmative. Talk to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history ofinsubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during theCardassian incident at Minos Korva. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will not be necessary. I have full confidence in myEngineering staff. I will be at the banquet on time. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To be sure of what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if that presumption is correct, then we could havesustained other damage. Um, Computer, status report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And my understanding is these men areprogrammed to survive. Is that correct? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. If you care to join us, we have a well-proventransporter device <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It happened again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, how is Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been saving this for a special occasion. My brother onEarth produces fruit known as grapes, which he turns into wine. He'sreally quite good at it. Chancellor, we have a tradition called atoast. It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune, and Iwould like to propose a toast to a new friendship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You seem I've always believed that becoming involved withsomeone under my command would compromise my objectivity. And yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Aceton assimilators? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? What can I do for you, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Number One. Now, Lieutenant, conduct theCommander to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take him to Sickbay. Let me know the instant he's awake. Anything new on that that thing out there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Horse. Earth horse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, where are you taking him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Au revoir, Natasha. The gathering is concluded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scan for lifeforms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here too. I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course you couldn't. It was the most human decision you'veever made. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: I commend your performance, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He had second degree burns on his chest andmultiple fractures of his right arm, but he's going to be fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulans have always wanted to destroy the alliance betweenthe Federation and the Klingons. If Mister La Forge had killed you,Governor, I think you would agree, they might have succeeded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Tasha? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't help them. But it's my guess they're in no danger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, how would she react to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you do. I'm looking forward very much to meeting withthe Premier of Iyar. There will be a reception held in your honour whenyou will meet the rest of my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on myway to your home world, but I shall be leaving you in the safe hands ofmy most experienced officers. Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire,is my head of Security. He will be in charge of your safety whileyou're on board. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will beyour personal liaison office, Ambassador Loquel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Contact Starfleet. Find out what they know about Korris andcompany. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, keep that option ready. In the meantime, proceed with theanalysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what I always called my first officer. So, here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait. Wait. That's not possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is he saying, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed, DaiMon Tarr. You should be able to view us now. Are weon your screen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They were trying to determine our intent. Theywanted to see if we would fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we're here! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of mostenormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much morethan simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then the Romulans could still be in the vicinity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it afew hours ago. All the crew members were dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns. Can youisolate one of them and magnify? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may request additional team members, but in the bestinterest of this investigation, I think you should work with CommanderData. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. Lay in a course for theMorgana Quadrant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I never felt better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you've got some sort of fast growth strain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly. When they try to bring their ships through, theEnterprise and the Tian Nan Men will swing around, close the gap andcatch them in the act. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know they won't get very far. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! The challenge is unequivocally refused! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must tell me. What was it? You don't know what I'm talkingabout. You're locked into a single intent unable to change. Unable toalter any part of your previous actions. P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're suggesting he created the problem just to solve it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which would infect the entire Collective. We could disabletheir neural network at a stroke. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, I may not have your gifts at reading emotions, Counsellor,but I can tell when someone is in pain and hiding it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I remember my biology, there are several natural immunesystems that come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetusfrom viral infections. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Well, I have a little work tofinish up, then I'm going to my cabin. I'm going to put my feet up, I'mgoing to turn on my personal relaxation light and I'm going to losemyself in the pages of some old novel. What about you, Number One? You've earned a rest. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and youknow, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn'twant me to reach out to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In plain English, you're saying the dilithium is causing thegeological catastrophe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your rights? What about Rishon? Is she in favour of being hereleft here? Come to the Enterprise. Let me take you where you'll besafe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, is the Ferengi Goss still on board the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm tired of fighting with you, Robert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and theplanet. Force fields full on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel red alert. Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have beencontinuing our research, while the Federation Council studies ourpreliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain thatwhat we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD:  <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not satisfied. I want an explanation of this by thetime we reach Parliament. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An ancient trail along the Kabul River inthe Himalayas. It's a wonderful programme. Will, it would do you goodto have a little fresh holodeck air. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wideexperience in inter-species contact. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've had to send people on far more dangerous missions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, please, let's try and resolve this matter. CaptainKushell, what crime has Okona allegedly committed against you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can assure you that I'm not given to casual relationships. There is something that I want to tell you. But nothere. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. Youare in Federation territory. Please explain your presence here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lock phasers. Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we don't know what's causing the disease. We can't protectourselves against the unknown. What we need is some kind of filter thatdoesn't depend on known biological factors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than atrip around the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, Doctor, I have been more than fair. I have doneeverything I can to substantiateyour, your perceptions of a <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, will you wait outside? Have a seat, Admiral Jarok. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've had similar feelings. With everyone succumbing it's evenmore important that one of us attempt to keep control of his faculties. I want you to turn in, take a nap. I'll be on the Bridge. You canrelieve me in four hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, neither can I. Unless they're baiting some kind of trap. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A significant beginning. But first, I must ask that DoctorCrusher be allowed to see her son before we continue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Battle alert, Mister Crusher. Condition Yellow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Inform Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you seen anything like that before? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I know your reason? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare for saucer separation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll attend to my duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. I'll be in my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Both of us. Now, if you will help me to get to theshuttle. Ow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please, take a seat, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven'tyou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam two from theJenolen as soon as we're within range. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So I am sentient, but Data is not? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Later, Data. A fish, Commander. A delicacy from the Caspian Seaon Earth It's a favourite of mine. Our replicator's never done itjustice, but I managed to store a few cases for special occasions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am concerned that if you return to your own time withknowledge of the future <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A life form. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fascinating, Data, absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs. Troiwould love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition ofbrown dwarf stars. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Harry? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't get the story of Gulliver out of myhead. Overpowered by Lilliputians. How long do we have to wait? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment. Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where am I, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can confer here on the Bridge, if no one has any objections. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I learned it on a planet called Kataan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you will release them, I will take theirplace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is Masaka? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, let's have a look. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you escort Commander Data to Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: AF? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, where have you gone to, my friend? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How many more? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to acrew can damage your credibility as a leader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It'll be good to have Counsellor Troi back, won't it, NumberOne? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data and the alien are on their way down. What would beinvolved in removing all memory of her communication with DataPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To study you. To understand your ways. Discontinue, Mister LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine, Mister Data. Proceed. Well, Mister Worf, let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man. Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data hassucceeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher hasdetermined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay'sUrodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The antimatter flow regulator is locked open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, where is Admiral Riker? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go onso long. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What kind of problems? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha, no. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then formulate this one. How do I deal Riker and the Hathaway? I will await your answer on the Bridge. And, Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your candour, but despite your condition there isno one better equipped to deal with these Romulans than you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Surprised? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there no hope for Brevelle or Mendez? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've been offered the Melbourne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does whilehe's asleep. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're controlling him, and you've corrupted the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the autopsy. Medical log, stardate 46075.1. I have performed anautopsy on Alkar's mother, but instead of answering our questions, theresults have created an even deeper mystery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you amplify the pheromones? They need to be much morepowerful than Deanna's actual scent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could your friend have returned to the starbase without tellingyou? An emergency of some sort? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Possibly, Number One, and I would be prepared to live with themystery, but Data's role in this must be ascertained or he'll never betrusted with starship duty again. Ensign, take us back to the scene ofthe crime. The T-tauri system, warp two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extend hailing frequencies, all languages, all channels. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you propose? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frere Jacques. That'sa song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know thatone? Good. It goes like this. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormezvous? Dormez vous? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of what is he accused? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Paul Menegay, a seven year old. He did a most interesting claysculpture of my head. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's still much to do. Still so much to learn. Mister LaForge, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: A most significant step. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then Masaka is your queen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take cover! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I'll take this opportunity to remove my ears. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evasive action. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. Very well done, Data. Your performance skillsreally are improving. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were there. The disruptors lost power. Computer, reset fordiagnostic of new sample. Begin scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But we can't stay in this area too long. You have ninehours. If you can get her underway by then,we'll escort her back to Starbase one oh five. If not, we'll evacuatethe survivors and destroy the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage report? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, kindly take charge of ourguests until we have time to decide what we're going to do with them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, withMasaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Answer me. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you find, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, you have the advantage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There was a woman who was frightened. And then you saw heragain, laughing, presumably at Lieutenant Kwan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf has served under my command with distinction. He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish thatthis Council, in its wisdom, will clear his family name and return himto duty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have the means. But first I must see my people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategicimportance of Outpost twenty three is minimal. Has been for years. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you help her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The alliance with the Federation is not based on lies, K'mpec! Protect your secrets if you must, but you will not sacrifice these men. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you mind thinking of something else. You're making mehungry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I order you to return to duty at once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were gettingalong. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our memorial service may have been premature. What anachievement. 'So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long livesthis, and this gives life to thee.' <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And, if we were to violate the Prime Directive, how <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Crusher, communicate with your mother at StarfleetMedical headquarters. Give her my regards, and tell her you have mypermission to remain on the Enterprise, but I will abide by her wishes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is your designation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's true that our presence here has had an unintendedinfluence on your society. But it's done and thereis no way to undo it. But feelings are running very high. Perhaps it'snot such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weighcarefully the consequences of what you're about to do. We are preparedto return in six months. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can we be sure we can get them out of you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It'll cause trouble. He's a Nausicaan. They can get veryill-tempered if they lose. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We misinterpreted your actions as an attack on us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should know that is impossible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we don't have time for that now. Mister Worf, send amessage to the nearest starbase. Ask them to dispatch a crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you understand our need to verify your claim. 2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my deathsentence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A cloaking device? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I look forward to your next concert. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Keep alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one pointin space. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To lose sixteen years. It's almost beyondbelief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, Doctor. Have you been briefed on what's happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this? Thisappears quite different. What do your sensors indicate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full weapon systems. Lock on. Open a hailing frequency. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a moment, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please. This is important to me. I believe that I can do more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court'scontention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Testwhether this is presently true of humans. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if it doesn't work, we won't have another chance for eightyears. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume that you must be Lieutenant Commander Daren. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then you're aware that we have no hostile interaction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am pursuing it with due vigilance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they going to die? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These are Commander Troi's quarters. Can you tell if she'sinside? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, Counsellor! Oh, no, Counsellor, I don't think so. Heneeds someone who is trained in these things. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hmm? What? Oh, er, France. Labarre. My home village. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, eh,Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did something hit us, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Just have Mister Data fetch me in a shuttle. And have him bringalong a uniform. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. You can. But only I can command them. They follow myorders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are the Ornarans recovering? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. The bridegroom. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, Mister Data, your hypotheses rarely are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Since you're concerned about these tests. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek and I share a particular bond. Our lives touched in anunusual way. I admit I feel the effects of his death. The tenor of thismission has changed, Mister Data, at least it has for me. We were sentto confront Spock about his disappearance. Now, I also have to tell himthat his father is dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, explain Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prisoners on whose authority? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I promised Mister Nelson that you would assist him withthe sensor diagnostic. You'll find him hard at work on deck thirty six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you believe her, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Special operations on Celtris Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All stop. Initiate long range scans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, how long before the stormreaches the outposts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there a treatment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Attention on deck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's alright, Mister Worf. I think, for now, circumstanceswarrant caution, nothing more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One to beam down to away team location. Hurry! Engage! Transporter Room. Urgent! Engage! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, why not? We're talking about a threat to the entire futureof the Federation. I don't think any of us can rest easy until we'vebeen to the source. Captain's personal log, supplemental. While it isquite unusual for a starship to return to Earth, we seem to be leftwith no other choice. I have apprised the remaining bridge crew of oursituation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything else, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back intime. Is that what happened here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've noticed qualities in you that could be harnessed, moulded. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We mean you no harm. We must warn you that your planet is aboutto experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellarcore fragment. No structure will be able to withstand them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For the moment. Can you tell me if Deanna's incident is relatedin any way to this missing time period? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here. Iwant to reassure you that we have no hostile intention. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But they've not fired. Let's try them again. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, did you draw any other conclusions from yourexperiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us to understandthis situation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is that what you're doing here? Trying to recapture thosefeelings? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Prepare to launch a classfour probe to study the energy field. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are no one's servant, Liko. I neither desire your obediencenor your worship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis. Well, perhaps we'vegot a tempest in a test tube, after all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel red alert. Mister Worf, will you extend the appreciationof the Federation and my personal gratitude to the Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Earl Grey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe we should contact her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, the situation is under control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, that's certainly another option, but as we're stopping atStarbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, is there some reason why you're trying to giveyourself more work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it is reasonable to take precautions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's a lava tube beyond here that runs for seventy fivemetres, then it connects with another chamber. We need to get throughhere. This tube opens up beyond this crack. We could widen the opening,then we should be able to crawl through. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's defended by Starfleet. You don't think they're just goingto stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There were stories of prisoners taken back to Romulus, butthese were only rumours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we don't regain control, then no oneelse must have it either. Now, this is the one decision involving theoperation of this vessel which requires you and I to be in totalagreement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I think you had better see who's at home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Many. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's a trader. He doesn't attract customers by being hard tofind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor. I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Use Science Station two, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Run a level one diagnostic series. Come. I want a computerthat's one hundred percent to expedite Doctor Stubbs' experiment. Aswell as the food slots in Sickbay. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge and Doctor Clark have madeno headway. Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf have picked nothing upanything on their scans. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, please! Let me remind you he is innocent until he isproved guilty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. His name is Flaherty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley, because I mustimmediately lock a tractor beam onto the Tsiolkovsky, then tow it outof, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Move to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, all right. Legitimate questions about any of thisneed not be asked apologetically. You feel uncomfortable about aspectsof your duplicate, Data. We feel uncomfortable too, and for no logicalreason. If it feels awkward to be reminded that Data is a machine, justremember that we are merely a different variety of machine. In ourcase, electrochemical in nature. Let's begin to handle this as we woulddo anything else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we decode it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But surely, to present yourself in this condition is not goingto help our cause. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's certainly no joke. As you can see, we are physically quitedifferent from Malcorians. And, with your permission, I'm prepared toprove it to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, and one piece of good news.. We're to rendezvous with ashuttlecraft carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from theAcademy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you build one? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree that's a risk, but I see no alternative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion. Warpeight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've seen your mission briefing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your son? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's trying to find an access terminal so he can interface withthe collective. He doesn't understand that the signal has been cut off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's happening to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have no wish to kill you. We never have. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, you are needed in Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There will be no bloodshed. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I detonate it. But how? How do I do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceedin our own way. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much Iadmire his son. Hello, Alexandra. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will? That's true. I started off calling you Beverly, and ofcourse, naturally, you. I'm still not thinking straight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The necklace. It broke. I saw it in the cargo freighter, on thefloor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It'swhole. How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert, Lieutenant Worf. I'llbe in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Impudence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you putting mankind on trial again? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are our orders? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think you will find that attitude prevalent among all theEnterprise people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems Commander Data has it them as well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Too bad. I rather enjoyed the idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Come, sit down. Counsellor, you've had theopportunity to observe Doctor Pulaski for some time now. How would youevaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Medical ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we can't go back and we can't stay here. We've got tokeep going for the mountains. No matter what is waiting there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. Captain's log, supplemental. We're en route to theFederation Research station on Gagarin Four. The mere thought of apossible connection between the Lantree tragedy and a genetic researchfacility fills me with profound apprehension. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about his skin colour? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't you understand? The Bringloidi can help you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Clark, this is Captain Picard. We are ready to beam youand your staff on board the <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's seven. You said there were eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know Mister Mendoza, the Federation negotiator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want todisrupt your recreation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tayna, exactly is Apgar doing here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't have to do this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bach, the third Brandenburg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold for orders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I may have to take us out of the nebula. Iwant all the power you can give me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please respond, Ten Forward. Are there any members of mycrew who require medical assistance? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lock phasers on target. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm okay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must see my people in the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you are Borg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is simplistic. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, werethey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Granted, but to go to them now after twenty years later and askthem to leave what is now their home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is everyone off the Fleming? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Be careful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handledit quite well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise is ready, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Like it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Their priorities seem to have changed. Open. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Absolutely out of the question. The Prime Directive <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want you to know that I am not unsympathetic to what you'regoing through. Your mother's disappearance is tragic, but I cannot riskyour safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data. Viewer on. Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we'll find an alternative route. Let's go back up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Manual override on shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself. Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy forit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you had tell me as much as possible prior to hisarrival, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean to say you climbed through every tube on the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Indeed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may findthe solution within its pages. Ah. 'It was a dark andstormy night'. It's not a promising beginning. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. LieutenantCommander Data. This is Jenice Manheim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusherwill explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss thismission with anyone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree with the Counsellor. Amanda deserves to know the truthof her situation. We have no right to withhold such crucial informationfrom her. But it isn't going to be easy telling her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's the same Bridge. Nothing has changed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I wastalking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. Iwas in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lock on to Alkar's signal. Bring him on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about Mister Data? There must be some connection betweenhis odd behaviour and these creatures. Is he infested as well? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This ship has a mission to carry out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is unusual. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. Atfirst, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then Iwas in the past just before our first mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of theplanet's surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. It's just that you are the fifth woman to ask me thatquestion this morning. All I require is to sit in the sun and read mybook. Alone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, at least you got rid of the damn pipe. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began tounderstand that there was something that was different about them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. We proceed with the plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Whalen. I bet he knows more about Dixon Hill than I do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ask if they would consent to an examination, just to becertain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, we've picked up an automatedsignal from a Federation shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Load torpedo bays. Arm phasers. lock coordinates on the sourceof the tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, how long will this behaviour last? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In light of your telepathic abilities, it raises the question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand what you're trying to say. Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So what went wrong? Why are they dying? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A distress call from a ship called the Kallisko. It's beingpursued by an unknown object. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's in a state of total anarchy. When the Prime Minister wasassassinated, a Federation research team was on the planet. It'sbelieved that they were forced into hiding. Your mission will be tolocate and to evacuate them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, why was this door locked from the outside? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wonderful. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Return at once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan, how much more can you tell us aboutthese creatures? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'llbe in main Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three, energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed! <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camorauthorities. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good idea. I hope you learned that running away solves nothing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set auto-destruct sequence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then what was the foremost archaeologist in the Federationdoing here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep SpaceFour, and then an Al-Leyan transport to Caere, and then the shuttle toIndri Eight. Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which isslowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm toldthat in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I have every reason to believe that they will resistany attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergencysession of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must bereopened. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we actually talk to them yet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister DataDATA <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: AlkarALKAR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A marshal of France? Ridiculous! Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must speak to you about your son. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What had to be done? For whom? Why does a man with a long andbrilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he hasbelieved in, even fought for, all his life? I believe it is because ofwhat they did to your wife and your children. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We should run a complete diagnostic of all commandsystems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it seems to be humanoid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not going to let you waste this. This is more valuable tous as a coolant or disinfectant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What carried the Artemis <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Actually, I don't know. I always imagined that she did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, if it's anything like the last time, I'm sure you won'tbe disappointed <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He might have killed all of us. And I believe he was actingunder direct orders, Baran. You betrayed us. This has gone far enough. I think it is time that we had a new commander. Someone who will leadus to those profits that we've been promised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Rex's bar? Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing freq. Why are we gaining on them? Don'tanticipate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, do you hear me? Irepeat. Data, do you hear <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end. Stay awake. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's over, Q! Get us out of here. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Leave Starfleet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have much time. It's good to seeyou, Will. I didn't expect to meet you here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We were traveling at warp two through the Maxia Zeta starsystem when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired onus, point-blank range. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Why not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And, Mister La Forge <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. But let us put this to rest as quickly as possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This equipment will have to be confiscated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't say, Number One. But at least they're not new enemies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Isn't that exactly what we anticipated? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you know what could? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Describe it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, I want you to stop this immediately! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I won't. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Say Mac, I would like to buy a newspaper too, but I don't haveany money. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You must understand, Number One <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, on the contrary, Professor, you were quite helpful. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain. Senior officers will report to myReady room immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But why would they attack us in the first place? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the situation, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I wantyou there when the away team returns. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Before we leave, I ask you one more time to come to the ship. For your own safety. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would be honoured. What scene? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then anyefforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to workthis out for himself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I am still havingdifficulty controlling the shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you please report to my Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire when ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And I've been wondering if they were the right ones. Sometimes I feel we've allowed our positions to isolate us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Sutherland. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destination? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some kind of reaction to our phaser fire, perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hunting them down is not what I am proposing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Back where it belongs? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Contact Commander Riker on Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the sensors show nothing out there, right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All that remains is the possibility of communication. Theremight be some way that we can warn them of their impending destruction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do not provoke her <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, come in, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? What are youseeing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps some day we will discover that space and time aresimpler than the human equation. No coordinates laid in, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise is scheduled to leave the Tyran system tomorrow. If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a very good reason. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forward shields to maximum. Lock phasers on the sentry pods. Prepare to return fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I already like his choice in wives. I never thanked youfor your correspondence. It made me feel like part of the family. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to discuss with you the specific areas of ship'ssecurity that I would like <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's only possible use could be as aweapon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, get your team back up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure, Mister Worf. I have never known Data to tell alie, and yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Delete audio. All right, this'll have to do. We're here. there's a service conduit that runs to here and then leads to aJeffries tube here. But you and Ensign Ro will still have to cross thiscorridor before you can get to main Engineering. RO JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister Data, we're reading <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Curiosity. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan, they will die moments after they return. How can I askthem to sacrifice themselves based solely on your intuition? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if you succeed, can you use that information to help yourmother? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I shall certainly avail myself of your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, this is Chief Investigator Krag. Commander, bytaking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by theInvestigator, would it be possible to programme the Holodeck torecreate what happened on the science station? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Confirmed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Now please follow Commander Riker's instructions so ourship can get back to its normal routine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So far off course? DATA <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A parade? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not here to command. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Because I want to know exactly what you did. I want toknow how closely you are in communication with the alien, and whatyou've learned about it, and I want to know now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One Doctor Crusher has some livevaccine bacilli to be delivered to Tagra. It'll have to be shipped in astasis field. Will you make the arrangements? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because of your recent training, because you're Bajoran, andbecause of your past troubles with Starfleet gives you a certaincredibility. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And elates us. We wish you could understand the gloriousadventure ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct. Interval, twenty minutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only because their world was the first on this heading toParliament. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Answer affirmative. Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Believe me, it would give me great pleasure, but there isnothing I can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want a Security team stationed outside Sickbay, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe that. I would accompany you to toSickbay, but I doubt if that would do us any good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you don't release the hostages, I won't cooperate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The fragment will have serious effects on your planet withinsix days. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you proposing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Ensign Gates, set course for Starbase twonineteen, warp six. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how are you coming with that comm. link? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kevin does. He's the cause. At first I couldn't understand whyyour house survived the holocaust when the others hadn't. Then it occurred to me. It had been destroyed. That dwelling, where youserved me tea, where you danced your waltzes, is a reproduction. Realto the touch but capable of being created, destroyed, and created. Allon a whim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, try to make some sense out of this mess. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These people are no one's enemy, Senator. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And some would say they must be getting help. The Romulans areprepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over theFederation. Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of theKlingon Empire in the balance, they are content to stand by and watch? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, how long have you held your appointment onboard thisvessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Return to the ship immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not certain. It may be that there is some unusual effectproduced by the Ullians' telepathic activity. I'm going to talk tothem, and in the meantime, you're to stay here and recuperate. And ifyou remember anything at all about what happened, I want you to tell meimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hey, that's my hobby. Find your own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. That's how it starts. But the road from legitimatesuspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think. Something is wrong here, Mister Worf. I don't like what we have become. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbedduring the voyage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, of course not, Number One. Please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you're the key to this entire mystery and you've donenothing but block my every attempt to solve it. Why are you fightingme? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Location, Paris, Cafe des Artistes, as it appeared twenty twoyears ago. April the ninth, fifteen hundred hours, three o'clock. Warmspring day. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Without warp capacity, we're just a floating target. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll discuss your situation with Captain Endar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you in charge here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you read me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain, Enterprise. Request controlaccess Starfleet ship USS Lantree, Isao Telaka commanding. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As you wish. A short goodbye. Computer, save the programme ofthe character Moriarty, and then discontinue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you will escort Q toEngineering. You will assist Mister La Forge. Mister Worf, hail theBre'el Four science station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I was a young Starfleet officer, not many years olderthan you are now. Top of my Academy Class. Green as hell. And oh, sococky. Too cocky, as it turned out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must say, you're looking remarkably well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose you'll just have to go down there and find out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enough of this. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen to what Shakespeare is telling youabout the man, Data. A king who had a true feeling for his soldierswould wish to share their fears with them on the eve of battle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't dance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look, I don't wish to appear rude, but I am not seekingjamaharon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: 1941, A. D. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation could wind up buying a proverbial lemon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And do what? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it something that the shields can't handle? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But didn't your researches indicate a thousand adjustments persecond would be required? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you should beam aboard our ship. There's something weneed to discuss. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> PICARD: Of course, you're giving thanks for your food. I'd forgottenabout that. I wonder how many other cultures have similar customs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse power, full impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's our ETA? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you violate it, you may jeopardising your career. Starfleetdoesn't take these matters lightly, Will. I can't defend you if you gotoo far. Do you understand that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long aspossible! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where we are, where we were, and where we will be. Data, I wantthis to be an away team of one. You. I don't think there's any reasonto risk anyone else. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what iscausing the temporal anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can imagine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It has something to do with Counsellor Troi. Somehow when it'sdealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her. I'm going to beam down. Lieutenant Worf, you have the conn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very impressive. There's something you should know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Clearly this was much more than an empathic echo. It seems thatyou were actually seeing something that happened in the control roomeight years ago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're right, perhaps we could escape the loop by avoidingthe collision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Were you able to salvage anything else from the escape pod? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold fire. Mister Crusher, come about to course one four eightzero zero three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shallwe? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we appreciate your time. You areexcused now. Mister Worf, will you bring in the next person? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I so challenge. Convene your hearing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, Captain Louvois has issued a ruling. You are the propertyof Starfleet Command. You can not resign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You interfered with our Farpoint mission. You threatened toconvict us as ignorant savages, if, while dealing with a powerful andcomplex life forms, we made the slightest mistake, and when that didn'thappen Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I never said there was a prospect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The loss is mine, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And we report our observations how? To whom? Can you get us back? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps prevent one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How old is the boy now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit withus here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you match these stars to our charts? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That would be like striking a spark in a gas-filled room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, bring the Admiral up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'll be too busy discussing the finer points of watermanagement with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. And they won't be carrying meon a cloud of chromal vapour. Ops. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I believe what happened on the Horatio wassabotage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are they attacking anything other than nitrium alloy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, request granted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put it on the screen, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long will it be? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will assist us to assimilate this vessel. You are Borg. Youwill assist us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We were hoping that you could tell us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A message? Very well. Tell Gowron, leader of the High Councilof the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard,needs a favour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want a staff meeting on the observation deck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On a count of three. Stand by on phasers. One, set warp tonine. Two, divert shield power to the main engines. Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. Do you see any problemsconnected with this old starship coming in, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we will have to find someone too whom she will listen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All decks, all stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But our spirit, it is indomitable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a strange sensation. Suddenly having these thoughtsappear in my mind. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, thank you for your help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As soon as we are secure of this rescue operation, I'll discussall of this new power <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Both parties are involved, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any starships ever reported missing in this sector, MisterData? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long before you have it in position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. If I could just get access to the Enterprisecomputer just for a few moments. So, what will Baran do once he'sobtained the second artefact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And nothing shameful in a strategic retreat, either. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, security override request. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, you want me to lie? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I won't do it. I won't alter history. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we speak to Data directly or would that wake him up? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm curious, Mister Data. Why are you looking at all theseother cultures? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A singer? I look forward to reading your report, Commander. Atleast, I think I do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor Galen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Anyone receiving this transmission,please respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And the three of you speak for him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is beyond my power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I understand one of these devices successfully repaired afaulty power grid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain. We have arrived at the Tyran system. All senior staff to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is speaking? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I may not show my feelings to my crew, but I do have them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can you do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, come in. Transporter Room, this is the Captain. Weare out of contact with the away team. Beam them back immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Stone of Gol! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really, reallyaggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding tosome predatory instinct? Do you think he see us as prey? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which is four years ago. ARomulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coilshad collapsed, life support was failing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: let's proceed with the shuttle plan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nor I you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, we've lost transmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And punish us as well, it would seem. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, let's hope that you're mistaken, Ensign. But can youpoint us at the right individual, as Mister Data suggested? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I'll just say congratulations for now, Deanna. You'llexcuse me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, there are millions of lives at risk. If you have the powerto Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, they'll negotiate, or they'll call it that. They've takenwhat they want. Now they'll rationalise it by throwing us some sort ofbone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Number One. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have to know what's going on <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No! It is wrong. It is wrong! A lifetime of discipline washedaway, and in its place bedlam. Bedlam! I am so old. There is nothingleft but dry bones and dead friends. Tired, oh so tired. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are these beingsPICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, the Hera's last reported location was three hundredlight years away. How could it end up here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, you've heard? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting they're not who they say they are? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, Commander Data has informed me of your situation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Close enough, however, to see we're not there. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humanswore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think you are aware of your situation, or of how muchtime has passed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: mev yap! Sit down. We will begin the ja'chuq. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what have you found? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, all senior officers report to the Bridge. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: New heading. two eight four mark zero one three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't know. What I do know is, things will be different. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To the family that's irrelevant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Penny, er, do you think we could just talk for a while. I don'tknow anything about you. Where you're from, what your interests are,your last name. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Frankly, it's difficult for me, for many of us, to easilyaccept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone elsewants them to be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir, it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you didn't. And that's human. We make mistakes. Geneticmanipulation or not, nobody's perfect. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. We cannot allow ourselves think that. The SeventhGuarantee is one of the most important rights granted by theFederation. We cannot take a fundamental principle of the Constitutionand turn it against a citizen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, call it an extended loan. Since you lost your ship savingours, it seemed only fair. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A dare devil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concernsme is that you participated in acover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of acadet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sit down! Please. Please. Now, we're here to talk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's doubled back on us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come back with me. They won't know how much you know. You mayshake loose the truth. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try and hail them, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She's a fine ship, Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's just that I'm getting older. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What now? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Will you explain thesituation to him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you for your generous offer. I will take it underadvisement. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, you are now in Federation territory. Unless youwithdraw <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to the warbird. Inform them thattheir government will be contacted shortly about this incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The knowledge and experience of the humanPicard is part of us now. It has prepared us for all possible coursesof action. Your resistance is hopeless, Number One. First Officer's log, stardate 44001.4. The Borgship has resumed its course toward Earth. We are unable to pursuepending repairs to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, I know that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll meet you in the lobby in fifteen minutes. Be punctual. Oh,and I advise you to change your clothing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on allfrequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where is she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, will you use thesespecifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan? I must talk to youabout Spock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope that's true, Mister Data. Nevertheless, thisinvestigation began with your death. I am simply trying to see that itdoesn't end that way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've read about them for years, but they were so delicate noone expected to find any preserved. How do you know about them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Devoras. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall. Everything will be all right if you just keep climbing. What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing atschool? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought you might enjoy the Bridge, Miss Brianon. I'm awareof your interest in science. Perhaps you'd like to see the computerterminal <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Personal log, Commander William Riker. Stardate41153.7. The Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station, where Iawait the arrival of the new USS Enterprise to which I have beenassigned as First Officer. Meanwhile I have been asked to visit theFarpoint Administrator's Office, in the old city. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Raise all shields, phasers at ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover thatdistance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, Geordi, Deanna. I don't think you've met our host. Thisis Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Counsellor Deanna Troi. Thisis Commander Hutchinson. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You hoped this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was adangerous creature on this planet and you knew from the tale of Darmokthat a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmokand Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here, at El-Adrel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We come from several kilometres outside the city. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oops. Just where does she think you're calling from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Conference. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep hailing them. All channels, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Scan for survivors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That woman. She would. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No doubt, but they will pass. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was a little sudden. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll be there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A straw? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, she's fine, fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You admire him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, Number One. We've done all we can to help. Now it's time tomove on. This creature can continue itsexistence without any further interference from us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you prepared to hear her evidence in open council? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, sir, I'm not prepared to leave until your affairsare completed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When Pierre de Fermat died they found this equation scrawled inthe margin of his notes. X to the nth plus Y to the nth equals Z to thenth, where n is greater than 2, which he said had no solution in wholenumbers. But he also added this phrase. Remarkable proof. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it a wormhole? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Excuse me, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now would be a good time, Mister O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a defensive weapon. Have you been able to ascertain whathappened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Explanation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our guests will be leaving shortly. I need an emergency medicalteam down here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. He is more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What would you have me do, Data? How would you handle this ifour positions were reversed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time to intercept? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I honestly don't know. Good-bye my friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, we'll proceed to Indri Eight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard implicitly trusted you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, it's an important consideration. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. Access. Captain's log, supplemental. We now know who hascommandeered the Enterprise. The Bynars. We can't communicate with theBridge. Commander Riker and I will now try to regain control of ourship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipationcould not be stopped. What did you hope to accomplish by assistingthese people? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if I hand you over to Debin, then it's the same thing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to see my people in the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why did you leave the Earth and come to a brand new planet whenyou did? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are capable of matter-energy transport. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could it be that grandfather analogy that Graves planted in hishead?. Data is an orphan in a manner of speaking. Is it possible thatthe loss of Graves might have affected him? Touched him on someemotional level we didn't know he possessed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, we'll both beam in simultaneously in two different areas ofthe Bridge. With luck one of us will be a distraction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've already betrayed your people, Admiral. You've made yourchoices, sir. You're a traitor. Now, if the bitter taste of that isunpalatable to you, I am truly sorry. But I will not risk the lives ofmy crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the NeutralZone. You've crossed over, Admiral. You make yourself comfortable withthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I won't die? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Resume programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Gowron. This is an unexpected pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And that the sun revolved around it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Allow us to help Mister Whalen, and we will returnwith the item. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The admiral displayed a remarkableimprovement out there, wouldn't you say? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing anyfurther. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, thisexperiment is over! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready. Main phasers to ready. Go toRed Alert, please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then we have no way to track him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What are you looking at? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course for a return to Starbase one three threeimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that Lieutenant Riker will be happy to help you withthat. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have the boy brought to my Ready Room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jared, you're a wise and experienced leader, and I assume youtrust your senses? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Get him out of there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, one to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long before the waveovertakes us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin emergency evacuation. Stand by for saucer separation,Mister La Forge, can you remove the charge from the engine core? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: May I ask you a frank question? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You would see them die rather than share the medicine? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it seems that the discussion is over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have finallyarrived at 'audet Nine, where we will pick up the specimens of plasmaplague for transport to Rachelis. It is only because so many lives areat stake that I am willing to put this ship and crew at such greatrisk. Meanwhile, Counsellor Troi's pregnancy continues to progress atan astonishing rate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't. And I don't want to. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good work, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned todetect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in ourworld, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He has tried every technical means at our disposal to reachthem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Marie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher what was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Look after me? You? You were a bully. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I just needed a shoulder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyondGalaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude thatcan possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigationsensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from wherewe were? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Allow me, with the help of Mister La Forge, to explain. Computer, load Manua programme one, time index fourteen four one. Playprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be inthat escape pod, or what happened to the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen to me, all of you! Drop your weapons! Do it! Don't makeany aggressive movements. The resonatoramplifies violent feelings and emotions. And that's why you wanted meto pick up the phaser. That's how you were able to kill Narik andVekor. But I can see the symbol on that third artefact, and it is theVulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death. It's a warning that the power of the resonator can be overcome bypeace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hopeso. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tell me, how can I talk to her? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: By my programme as well, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We have little choice. Whatever has him is interrupting thetransporter beam. Remove it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will you have dinner with me tonight? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood. How many are there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well done, Doctor. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You really believe I would leave you here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, give me status on power recovery. Engineering,come in. Why aren't they answering? La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nor would I, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should get some rest. We can talk some more tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar's death is very painful for all of us. We willhave to deal with it as best we can for now. Until the shuttle crew issafely beamed aboard this ship, our feelings will have to wait. Is thatunderstood? Lieutenant Worf, you are now Acting Chief of Security. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Brull, in twenty days, I hope to be very far away from here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any particular reason for this change of heart? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, we are merely exploring all the possibilities. Lieutenant Uhnari's logs reported that Commander Morag had beenharassing the station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs Ten Forward. How is Lal doing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. Andhe had his own children but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so Iwas like the son who understood him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Where are myweapons? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That leaves us but one alternative. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. Welcome home, Mister Data. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee athousand errors see. But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,who in despite of view are please'd to dote. Shall I compare the to asummer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You knew what you had to do. I just made sure you listened toyourself. Goodbye, Cadet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was here in this room. I could have rid the Federation of amortal threat, and I let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The internal clock. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's put an end to their last cry for help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Bridge to Lieutenant Worf,acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inspector, Inspector, this is hearsay. She wasn't a witness tothis incident. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea how many security officers there are onboard a ship like that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, findout what they want. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reduce to impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's has been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence onRisa. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have twelve hours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll take your word for it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Graves, every man has his time. Every man, without exception. But you've cheated. You have extended your life at the expense ofanother. Graves, give Data back. Give him back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution. Memory invasion is simply not a crime we've ever had to contend with. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't confuse style with intent. Only a fool would questionCommander Riker's dedication to Starfleet and the men and women underhis command. He is simply the finest officer with whom I have everserved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nonsense. We programme an appropriately docile steed <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever that freighter was carrying, they certainly didn'twant it to reach us. Are you sure you don't know what it was? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It would seem that Baran has to deliver these artefacts to theassassin in order to get paid. Therefore, you and I should continue ourmasquerade. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is it at all likely that the Vico could have beenattacked inside the cluster? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, but Earth isn't likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone,or to repel a Romulan attack, It was my command which sent his motherto her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One way trip. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transfer helm to Engineering, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, the situation sounds so volatile. Perhaps a coolingoff period? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am taking it as such. Counsellor. You have the Bridge, NumberOne. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's start withthem, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'llfind you other choices. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's one reason we tend to suspect sabotage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. If I should need you further, I'll letyou know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we must measure our response carefully, or history mayremember Galorndon Core along with Pearl Harbour and Station Salem Oneas the stage for a bloody preamble to war. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One. Eighteen of our people have died. Please, tell usthis is one of your illusions. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pipe it through. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know. Do you know where you are? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on boardanother unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know whatyou've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. Youmade it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your techniquewas flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctorinvestigated it, she discovered what you had done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The man is dying. And it's my honour to tell him that his sonmay have betrayed the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out ofEngineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wrong, Number One. It was almost the longest. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think we shall find we have much in common. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any idea what it is or where it comes from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chancellor, I have made some fine ones in my time. Now, I mustask you, will you release my officer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, I know. I'll get it seen to, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Cancel. We'll deal with that later. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set your phaser to heavy stun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We had a lot to celebrate. Our team wasn't supposed to win. Wewere very proud of them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you will be missed. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates, set a course and engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my Security Chief, Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I demand to see a neutral representative as required by theFederation-Cardassian peace treaty. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't know when to tell them we will be there. Is ourbusiness with the J'naii finished? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Captain. This is the Captain of the Enterpriseresponding to your signal for help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, what is my present location? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you're asking, you're asking me to restrict Mister Tarses'movements solely on the basis on Sabin's feeling. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems the Edo Lord agrees with you, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to know more about what happened down on Gravesworld. Lieutenant Selar, report to the Captain's ready room. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don'thave the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not muchof an actor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, gentlemen. Forgive this intrusion. I was justpassing by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You had a hand in helping me get out of this. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us thatwe have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alienworlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I havedisregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thoughtit was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to sometemporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't itpossible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to helpme to choose, because it's the right thing to do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, escort her to quarters. There's no need foryou to travel in the cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you would like to make one final inspectionof the unit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Change course to make a close sensor pass. We can then increasewarp speed and reach Parliament on schedule. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What could motivate someone like your father to commit such anact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do as Data says. At once. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Reverse engines. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Objection! It doesn't matter. Objectionwithdrawn. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Counsellor, are you in position? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So dangerous, Mister Worf, that he could have destroyed us inan instant had he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep clear ofhm. I want him to understand we mean him no harm <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You fell asleep. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Goodbye Mrs. Troi, and thank you. Energise, Chief O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're nearly there. Can you continue? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm not particularly impressed. All you've done is teach themto enjoy killing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't think that's a little harsh. I think that's the truth. But that's a truth we have obscuredbehind a comfortable, easy euphemism. Property. But that's not theissue at all, is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because if I order Data never to divulge what he sees in there,he won't, with the exception of anything that might belong to us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tau Ceti Three. It was a bar. Quite an exotic one as Iremember. What do I win? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is becoming very tiresome. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Earth was once a violent planet, too. At times, the chaosthreatened the very fabric of life, but, like you, we evolved. We foundto find better ways to handle our conflicts. But I think no one candeny that the seed of violence remains within each of us. We mustrecognise that, because that violence is capable of consuming each ofus. As it consumed your son. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> PICARD: In for a penny, in for a pound, is that what you're saying,Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fair's fair. And let's credit his science teacher, too. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So Gowron has come on board in order totest your claim. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert until further notice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room. Computer, delay time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who is Pardek? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. Battle stations. Bring us to an attack posture,Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is morelike the sun and the moon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Horses? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that youhaven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist calledFreeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow spherecould be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage ofharnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living onthe interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources ofpower. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But it puzzles me. If you feel that way for Tasha, why have youchallenged her to a fight to the death? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It seems I did make that bargain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers! I'm sorry. Hewas in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortalthreat, and I let him go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's a trap. Come on! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. In the meantime, I'll speak with the KlingonGovernor about Commander Morag. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard, commanding this Federation starship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's not just my opinion. He's been decorated by StarfleetCommand five times. He's been offered his own ship more than once. Ithink if you just gave him a chance, you'd find him an outstandingofficer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can believe it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Jarok has provided me with thelocations, strengths and tactical plans of the Romulan fleet. Mister La Forge, he is prepared to give you data regarding engines,weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird classstarship. But I believe his experience as a field commander will bemore valuable for its strategic sense than in the technical areas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing in my experience canpersuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know onething. It will not affect my judgment at our next encounter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long do you need? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be. Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with theselife forms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I should contact the Enterprise, have them meet us atVulcan just in case these isolationists try to escape. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, if we're not holding the Ferengi and they're not holdingus, who the hell is? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You would have me make the decision for you, nut I can't dothat. I am willing to talk to these people with you, and I will urgethem not to make an impulsive choice, but if finally they choose toleave, the Enterprise will not turn them away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, advise the Astral Five annex. This should becatalogued and scheduled for retrieval. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you break a few rules? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski. I want you to go through them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When children learn to devalue others, they can devalue anyone,including their parents. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're discussing the Ferengi. I wish I had some clue as to whatthey will do next. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we could <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Precisely what Data recommended, as I recall. At least it gaveCommander Riker the opportunity to consider his promotion. Now thathe's accepted, we can leave him at Starbase Montgomery. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No one suggested otherwise, Counsellor. Mister Data, try toisolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps there'll be abasis for communication. Mister La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jumpas soon as you're prepared. That'll be all. Counsellor <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What race are you? Where are you from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran every word that I've said. He knows that Idon't think much of him as a leader. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would you step into my Ready room, please. And bring atricorder with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Still, there are some points that I'm not very clear about. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Course one one eight mark three five seven, full impulsepower. Signal the fleet to get underway. We'll enter warp once we'reclear of the system. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What for? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's blast full power into warp nine. Ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would any of those apply here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But at what cost, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, lock onto the neutrino beam and stand by. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between thisculture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going toimprovise. Mister Worf, what's our status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He was in need of emergency repair. It was our obligation toassist. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is it possible we've fallen into the same snare that killedthem? A thousand year old booby trap? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. Whatdo the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Data. Give me some background. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That human-shaped robots need not be clumsy or limited. Youcertainly operate as well as we do, Data <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talkabout running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on theagricultural areas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are six years old. Weak and helpless. You cannothurt me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you Jason Vigo? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I wish, I wish time would have allowed me to knowyou better. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think it's time that you and I had a talk with Maques. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And what exactly is Ansata policy with regard to hostages? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he's an android. Is that possible! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, call medics. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will. How the hell do I advise you? Youknow the implications as well as I. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. So that's why you married me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring the ship about. Let's take alook at Mister Worf's distortion. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Captain Scott could be of use in accessing thatmaterial. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then let's start at the beginning. The first entry seems to bestardate 30620.1. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not perfect in what way? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You will agree, Data, that Starfleet'sorders are difficult? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, how old are you, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One moment, Captain. Captain Endar, last night Jono attacked mewith a dagger. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He said that he was down there recently. He seemed confidentthat it could be done safely. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He said that he had nowhere to go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As a result, we won't be able to rendezvouswith the Kearsarge for another four days. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Such as? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. I believe the starship Sutherland will need acaptain. I can think of no one better suited to the task thanyou. DATA <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inversetachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing lookslike. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard. Welcome aboard. We hope your journey willbe pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my First Officer,Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wonder what they're thinking over there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this part of the same pattern? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. The only person you're truly competing against, Wesley,is yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Time? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You've given me nothing to believe in. Just a lot of vague talkabout strange patterns, irrational proposals. Who's behind this, and towhat purpose? How are people being changed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you suggest we proceed? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, what's happening? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do I hear anger in your voice? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can't correct it we may have to reverse course and leavethe nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room, when your duties permit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Another moment and <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power ofthought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I can't discuss it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroyed themselves, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not if you aren't guilty, Simon. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unless, of course, if you would prefer a porch. It wouldcertainly be easier to build. I could make a start on it right away. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, he's in our highest security detention area. Thereshouldn't be any more problems. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A creature against whom we seem to have no defence. Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you're here to persuade me not to use the invasive programme. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get a general status report? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Vorin, listen to me. We can visit many other worlds. We cantake you to one where you can build a new life. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're familiar with this life form? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, take us out of orbit and set course forXanthras Three, warp factor six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you ever consider applying to the Academy, going the wholeroute, apply to become an officer? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I can't. And I won't. Unless I have unequivocal cooperation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circlinghigh above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object. A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real. At least, it's not completely solid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. Ifit's not a disease, what else could have made them do that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes outevery year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've just been paid a visit from Q. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What can you not do anymore, Ensign? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there,Q. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, will you handle this at security station, decknine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You were right not to try. Once you became accustomed to thatpower, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La ForgePICARD <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've shut off the tachyon pulses in theother time periods but it hasn't changed theanomaly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why do you say that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, we would appear magical to Stone Age people. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you, we will do everything possible to make youcomfortable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Guinan, I don't know why you are involved in this, but <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Adjust speed to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You stay behind me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then he has? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Kamala. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inexcusable. And understandable. It may be that what you arelooking for cannot be found here on the Enterprise. Perhaps you need toimmerse yourself in Klingon beliefs in order to discover whether theycan hold any truths for you. Is there something you can do, is theresomewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, you can serve from within either ofthese two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that topcentre target. You have to return the ball before it bounces twice. Alright? Let's try it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. Open a channel to the warship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How long can we expect it to last? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Romulan ship will reach us within the hour. If our patientdies it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start anincident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of theFederation. Think of it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you stole it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, thecustoms here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous,strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry,this is becoming a speech. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's headed for Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may berelevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my ChiefSecurity Officer. His presence is required. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Command agrees with you, but I would feel better ifyou would consent to an escort or <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dream not of today. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Step on it. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If I weren't travelling through time I would never haverealized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in thepast as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, myability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what'sgoing on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shuttle occupant, identify yourself. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did we? Counsellor, I think it's time you took me to meetMister Conor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't believe it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it will have to be. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a case of simple mediation. You are asking me tochoose the next leader of the Klingon Empire. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. Link established. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your service aboard theEnterprise has been exemplary. Until now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you dosomething like that again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps so. Anything is possible. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The ship's computers sense a localised increase <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That can change. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is this brotherly concern? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The people involved in this are of the highest calibre. If Ididn't believe in their loyalty, I wouldn't have gone this far. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I really wonder. Halt. I've always believed that carryingchildren on a starship is a very questionable policy. Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks, certain dangers. Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not a mission. It's personal. It's between Q andmyself. I don't want the rest of you involved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think, Number One, we cannot assume anything. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Geordi, get us back to Aldea. Warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is an understatement, Data. Is it possible that someone orsomething could have affected you without your knowing? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Specifics, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nothing our sensors were able to detect indicated that theEssex went down in that region. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you said that this was formed from the organic matterfound in thedeck plates. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filledwith you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's not necessary. Go on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routinesafety precaution. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok. We would like you to beour guest here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, we'd should be getting along to Ten Forward. We'regoing to be late for the concert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: More than anything else, you wanted the Enterprise away fromRana, because the house, the plot of land, your very existence, wereincongruities that you were not prepared to explain. The warship,another recreation, tried to chase us away twice, and failed. But whenI came to your house the second time, I provided you with the onlycondition that would make the Enterprise leave. Your deaths. You didyour best to satisfy that condition. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That pleases me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For now, Hayne's Coalition is our only safe access to thecolony. We'll keep the door open, see where it leads us. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Geordi? I'm very sorry that you didn't find yourmother. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hopefully he'll tell us, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander, you have crossed the Neutral Zone. This isFederation territory. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you reading anything, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, Data. Propose it to the nanites. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here. Why? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The isolinear chips were definitelyaltered? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you sure? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think when one has been angry for a very long time, one getsused to it. And it becomes comfortable, like old leather. And, finally,it becomes so familiar that one can't ever remember feeling any otherway. Thank you, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, are you ready? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Halloween? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Long range scan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Open up the transporters in Cargo bay two and diverteveryone from deck seven to there. That should put it back on track. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what do we know about this Ardra? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I want you to drive the warp engines to fullpower, and direct a flow of energy out into the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Our guests will be moving shortly to cargobay four, where the transport will occur. I want you to ensure them ofsafe passage between Ten Forward to the cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I'll go down there myself. Keep me apprised. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It appears that I am not immune to the strange forces that areat work on this ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A highwayman. It's a robber who attacks travellers, but nonehave been reported in this vicinity for centuries. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How's it going? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was moreconcerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the missionthan with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of themarks of a good officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The odds are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whatever the problem, we'll handle it up here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Troi, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anna, no matter how long it takes, we will get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What was it that didn't you mean to do, Timothy? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I came to you. You're the officer for this sector. Ihad no choice but to come to you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there any possibility she could survive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You had no right to involve me without my permission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the evacuation, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome back. Counsellor. Geordi, Data, reconfigure thecomputer and the records. Number One, I want you to oversee the rest ofthe ship. And this time, let's get it right. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm fine. Really, Marta, I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it should be a very enjoyable visit, then. She'll betransporting on board as soon as we reach the Starbase. Would you liketo greet her on our behalf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A malfunction. Emotional awareness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ready tractor beam, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't our sensors alert us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. All stop. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's it, exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you socompletely you've lost even the desire to even question it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He's being held safely until sundown. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security teams had just been sent to transporter room three. And to Sickbay. Counsellor, will you go to Sickbay and investigate? Mister Data, go to main Engineering. See if you can determine the causeof that power surge. I'll be in transporter room three. Mister LaForge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken thesample. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A number of objects have been discovered missing in the lasttwo days, and if they're in your possession, then we would like themreturned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In a manner of speaking. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about the planet surface? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I call to the stand Commander Bruce Maddox as a hostilewitness. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I thought that I had made that clear. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware thatsomething strange is going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, now that we've established our mutual good will, what'son your mind? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You, sir, you will explain your error and apologise, and praythat we can negotiate a peace we can all live with. Is that clear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I appreciate your time constraints, but recognising newlife, whatever its form, is the principal mission of this vessel. Please. Now, Mister Data, will you tell us what makes you think thatthe exocomps are alive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is the way in which we propagate our species. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capablespecies. We can only hope that they realise it's in their own interestsand take similar action. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we're going to trust our lives to these systems, we shouldbe certain they're not going to fail. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, sweep the area. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q, you exceed your own standards of self-preoccupation. Youhave no concern for an officer who may have saved your life. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If time is so important, why didn't they transmit the orders bysubspace? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The lines are being drawn. All this for a chosen son. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your clarity of thought. Your objectivity, as always. Sit down. Data, it's very possible we are about to go to war. The repercussionsof what we do during the next twenty four hours may be felt for yearsto come. I want you to keep a record of these events, so that historywill have the benefit of a dispassionate view. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As of now, we don't have sufficient evidence one way or theother. I want you to examine her shuttle. You might find somethingthere which will shed some light on her story. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I ordered you to lie? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, Mister Data, I'm going to ask you again, and I order youto directly answer me. What really happened to us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security code? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you took Sovak's money. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But if they have abused the boy, why would he so devoutly wishto return to them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was my error, not hers. Chancellor, there is no starshipmission more dangerous than that of first contact. We never know whatwe will face when we open the door on a new world, how we will begreeted, what exactly the dangers will be. Centuries ago, a disastrouscontact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decidedthen we would do surveillance before making contact. It was acontroversial decision. I believe it prevented more problems than itcreated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, red alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign. Well done. Initiate that procedure . Lieutenant, add that information to hailing messages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I suppose it's an understandable progression. Computers makedecisions based on inputs and we humans give off a multitude of subtlesigns that communicate our emotions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your point is well taken, Counsellor. Number One, you're goingto have to go down there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Give me a chance to put things back the way they were before. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Situation report, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Conor, I believe that you and I should talk. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And you have survived all this time as? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grand. Take a look at thecontainment module our Chief Engineer has designed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Destroy the tricorder. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Forget it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You should feel bad, and you will pay for what you've done. Admiral Brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand, youracademic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will notadvance with your class. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you will plan on remaining on board for a while. Thereis still much that we need to understand about what has happened toyou. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any communication, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, we can stall the representatives. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money. Captain's log, supplemental. We have received wordfrom Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will beattacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position inthe Hugora Nebula to wait for them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it can be, but I have never subscribed to the theory thatpolitical power flows from the barrel of a gun. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if what you're saying is true, then Rocha attackedLieutenant Uhnari to find a new body. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting that a bubble could have made Doctor Quaicedisappear? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to be returned to my ship immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Donald, what's a nice Starfleet Captain like you doing in aplace like this? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In this situation, Prime Directive prohibits me from helpingyou. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Could there be some sort of cloning involved here? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Find them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Governor, if I could explain this I would. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You never told me about this. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I need to talk to a friend. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've told you all that I know. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Does he understand the situation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And respects. Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: As if it's something Q is doing to trickus? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't just stay here while our ship is beingcommandeered. JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Some other time, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The two of you are acquainted? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I remember hearing about it. The ship was destroyed by a warpcore breach as I recall. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I want to meet your mother. Can you arrange that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Would theyhave kept it thatsimple? Try it. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Arabian. The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south windand made the horse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not yet, Mister Worf. This is just a tap on the shoulder, or wewouldn't be here talking about it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm in no mood for your foolishness, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But he knows where he is, who's here with him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I certainly did, and I expect it to stay turned off. Wouldyou come down from there? I see you've made yourself at home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assure you Captain Riker is quite well. He's looking forwardto attending the final negotiations as planned. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's continue this discussion in private. Number One, you havethe Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Garadius system. Warp six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Surely you have emergency supplies? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's keeping them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think I understand the predicament you were in. It could nothave been an easy choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is the Enterprise at risk? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, it has. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Elbrun, one of the reasons I'm asking you to workclosely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardlytrivial. And yet <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millionsof lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that same path again. Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us onelast chance for peace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, not under these circumstances. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. You've beenhere before. You negotiated a release of the hostages with Karnasbefore. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid? It's my away teamyou're sending in there. I think there's something you're not tellingme, and I have a right to know what it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I think we could all use a twelve hour layover. Besides, I'vejust received some personnel transfer directives. Priority matter, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, it's not that. Or is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What a language. <eos>

 <bos> PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Ourcaptors refuse to show themselves. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: To freedom. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, so long as they're on board this ship, I'm ahostage no matter where I am. We all are. I must find out who we'redealing with. If La Forge and Ro can attempt a rescue in short order,then let them proceed. If they can't, I will provide you with anotheropportunity. Watch for it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on. Alright, don't worry, we'll get you out of here. Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Data? Lieutenant Yar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Q. I knew it. What's going on? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. Sit down. Look, this perhaps may be nothings, butI've been feeling a bit odd of late. Fatigued. And now I've got thisdamned headache. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go on with your report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. Butalthough I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral Necheyev, welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is our procedure, Ensign, to notify command of anypossibility of danger to the ship. The decision is not yours. Do youunderstand? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest we do? JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not a relapse I hope. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When did this start? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Options? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, disengage the power transfer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Alive? How? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I don't see why we couldn't just practice in my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And it's been determined that they date back to the latenineteenth century? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we see into the lab yet? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You mean it's complete? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, we're ready. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Being the only Klingon ever to serve in Starfleet gave you asingular distinction, but I felt that what was unique about you wasyour humanity, compassion, generosity, fairness. You took the bestqualities of humanity and made them part of you. The result was a manwho I was proud to call one of my officers. I'll have your belongingstransported to the Bortas. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is beyond my purview. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Danar, I'm transferring you to Angosian security. They're en route. They will arrive shortly. I wanted to tell you I haveno choice. The Prime Minister insisted and we have no right to refuse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're taking all the adults down to the surface. It lookslike they're keeping all the children on board the ship. Where was yourdaughter? JR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not on board my ship. I will not allow it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: These were not ghosts. what did we see? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: She has a Romulan cloaking device? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll notify Starbase of your acceptance They'll contact theKlingon vessel, make the arrangements. Captain's log, stardate 42506.5. We have departedfrom Starbase one seven nine and are headed for a rendezvous with theKlingon vessel, Pagh. I have informed the staff of Commander Riker'stemporary assignment. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And something else that's circling your world. It's veryimportant to us, and perhaps to you, to know what it is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly. He's fine. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. But I'll tell the gambling foreman someone's been tamperingwith his dom-jot table. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite acard player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long timeago. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. We come inpeace. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a confession givenby me, Jean-Luc Picard commanding Stargazer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bridge, release security forcefield eight B. Hello, Jeremy. Howare you? Are you frightened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there some way of stretching out the formalities once theyarrive? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You have the conn, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have to go. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you just ask for our help? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matterfor the king that led them to it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll do my best to arrange that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're going to assume the Yamato's mission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Screen off. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, take a look at this. It appears that Mister Worfhad just beamed these three on board, and according to this, threeother Romulans had been beamed directly to Sickbay just secondsearlier. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf, the next few days will be difficultfor you <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How do you know that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor, may I see you in my Ready room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hold course, Mister Crusher. Continual fire, all phasers. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That sounds like an illogical philosophy. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But I am. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps someone to answer your questions, Number One. Openhailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain! Donald, come in! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agree. Do what you can to accomplish that, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Barre, France. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, what's our status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They want to go home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher. Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Injury report, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sickbay, this is the captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Targeted for what? By whom? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I can find my own way there. Thank you, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Woven art? Recovered intact? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect meto forget a lifetime spent there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can we get a visual? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Warren is here. We're doing all we can. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in ajoint exploration of the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We can't survive in this sun. Where there's mountains, there'sshelter. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The one that leads to total annihilation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far tooimportant to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come on, Beverly, we've got to get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty ofAlgeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloakingtechnology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise went through a wormhole, Doctor. It seems theentire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So, while we still have some power left, itis time for difficult decisions. Opinions please. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: After what happened on Garon Two, she has no business servingon any starship, let alone the flagship, my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's true. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, allow me to introduce Chancellor Avel Durken and SpaceAdministrator Mirasta Yale. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, sowhat if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? Do you? Do you? Well, that's the question you have to answer. Your Honour, thecourtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we areleft with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later,this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regardthis creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people weare, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroomand this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries ofpersonal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagelycurtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all whocome after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet wasfounded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanteda chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope not, Number One. Mister La Forge, prepare to take us outof orbit. Set course for Isis Three. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Boothby, tell me some more about Nova Squadron. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I must say, I was little surprised when Commander Riker told methat you were aboard the Jenolen. Our records didn't show you listed asa member of the crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But you would rather stay and find out what it is? What is itsintent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Apparently not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail it. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, recognise Jean-Luc Picard, Alpha Two priority, andre-establish separation procedure immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, any woman who can beat a Ferengi at his own game bearswatching. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How serious? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do they represent? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I appreciate your concern. Transporting to the surface isonly going to make a bad situation worse. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, withmyself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest inwhat happens to me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: He is not for sale. Commander Data is, um, is, um <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Here we have Environmental and Engineering stations, missionoperations, and the two principal science stations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How can you be certain they're receivingus? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One's available? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's it's source? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,I'm better. The injuries are healing. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Number One? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Professor, you are a computer simulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder, I'm going totry to repair these energy relays. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If that's true, then help me. We want thesame thing. We both want the Enterprise to be safe. But there is apiece of information I don't have. What is it? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Please feel free to contact me at any time. Picardout. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Be ready to stop the power transfer, MisterData. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I don't think we can risk <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I lost a bet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Request approved. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, it was little better at the physiognomy workshop. DoctorVassbinder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionisation effect ofwarp nacelles before he realised that the topic was supposed to bepsychology. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, indeed. It's good to see you again, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Qapla' <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Greg. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're saying there are holes in their defence system? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I assume this is a simulation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. You knew this would happen, didn't you? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, key access four one two mark eight zero. Picard,Jean-Luc. Starfleet priority code Gamma. Decode. Begin message. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There's been an accident. Ambassador T'Pel has been killed in atransporter malfunction. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking upfrom a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of theEnterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then itall changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in thefuture, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't rememberwhat it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll get you some quarters. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right then. Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Excalibur. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not even troubling to cloak themselves. RIKER <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and thethreats are mounting. We need Odan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Chancellor, to instantly transform a society with technologywould be harmful and it would be destructive, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Warp eight, any heading. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you learned? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Not every man. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's the prognosis? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, new coordinates. Lay in a course for Lya Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data is a Starfleet officer. He still has certain rights. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My appreciation, madam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right, fine, good, let's throw the Prime Directive to thewinds. Let's detain her against her will. Let's destroy any chance ofpeace between these worlds. Let's interfere in their society, theircustoms. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Grand. Commence operations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairlineagain in the same way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Whose lives? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I don't understand why you are unwilling? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of passenger? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You know, there some words I've known since I was a school boy. With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured,the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us allirrevocably. Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdomand warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're alldamaged. I fear that today <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're out here to explore, to make contact with other lifeforms, to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere. Andabsolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What about my crew? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have you analysed the risk factor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to apotentially dangerous procedure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Because kidnapping is an immoral assault. The rights of otherraces must be respected. 4 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Worf. Klingon species. A warrior race. Youtoo will be assimilated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make no further attempts, Mister Worf. Any life form readingson the surface, Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stabilise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, we appear to be facing <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meet me in Transporter room two. We're going down to thesurface. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Terrorist carrier? Are you certain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate itsincorporation. Identify yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are excused, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps this Morag was the one who was interested in obtainingthe encrypted messages. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On my mark, fourminutes. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your best suggestion in an hour. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you are my First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, I can barely see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Progress? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: So you believe that what you saw was some kind of transmission? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council. Youare a member, aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findingswith the Federation Astrophysical Survey. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't let this just happen again, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Wait. You can. I'll let you. But first, tell me. What is, whatwas your other choice? P2 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What have you done to him? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That doesn't sound like the man who came to me a year agofiercely determined to return home and to clear his father's name ordie trying. Isn't it time to confront the Council? To regain yourfamily name? Let the truth be known? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have a good idea. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's preparedto admit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiettime, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. Thereare some ancient ruins that are just being excavated. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A simple yes would have sufficed, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I read that, too. Lieutenant Yar, what do your sensors show? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now that we know how each of us feels, perhaps we should not beafraid to explore those feelings. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Doyou remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zoneto investigate a spatial anomaly? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Continue on into close parking orbit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are as sceptical as I am. Is it logical to ignore your owngood sense? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We would be more than willing to extend our visit, sir. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for the incident in Engineering? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causingthe anomaly. We have to go back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: All right. I want to add the Tian Nan Men, the Sutherland andthe Hermes, whether the yard superintendent says they're ready or not. Mister Data, will you select a group of experienced Enterprise officersto augment the crews of those ships. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The medical records are our next priority. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Survivors? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski. We will handle the formalintroduction later. Counsellor Deanna Troi is pregnant. She is going tohave a baby. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that certainsacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfatherunderstood. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We will give you more on this as ourunderstanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert untilthe crisis is over. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I have confidence in the self-control of my crew, Kamala, butthere are guests and civilians on board. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I am open tosuggestions. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps you would clarify it for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, respond at once! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We haven't completed our analysis of thebomb debris. Doctor Crusher is still studying the remains of the twomen killed in the explosion. We need more time. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You are finished, Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Good. Helm, move us into a higher orbit so that we may keep thesurface of the planet under surveillance. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Based on what we know so far, there's nothing I can do. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Sheliak won't bargain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If we can possibly avoid firing on it, I would hope it would beMARR <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator hasbeen able to achieve. To make another functioning, sentient, android. To make another Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. That is absolutely out of the question. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They return home, leaving theassistant manager in charge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too. If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguishbetween thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him. Now. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion has something to do withthis. It could have affected him more profoundly than we realise. Either way, we have to find him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Pressure suit? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riker's presentation was devastating. He almost convinced me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They wouldn't intentionally hide it or make it difficult for usto find. It must be right in front of our faces. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Until they found this formula, barely in time. Picard to DoctorCrusher, come in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: When? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Number One, my fencing partner's cancelledfor this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very shortly, anywhere will be preferable to this room. MisterWorf, I am depending on you. You must get Data back to the Enterprise. He may be their only hope. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But shouldn't the safety overrides have prevented that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do we know about that pulsar? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. MisterData, how many people on the Enterprise are from non-Federationplanets? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In one hour, DaiMon Bok. End transmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: K'mpec, you cannot possibly be serious. A Federation officerhas no business in <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Now where did that come from? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They won't come to the ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You don't have to remind us of our duty. You just rememberyours. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. I'm not willing to give them up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do it. That's an order. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm greatly impressed with everythingI've seen so far, Prime Minister. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even if these weapons are genuine, I can assure you that athird party must have been involved. The Federation is not in thebusiness of supplying arms to rebels. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Full shields. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. There's a woman living here. She told me that she'd beento the shuttle. She said that she saw you dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We are prepared to transport you fromthe surface whether you come willingly or not. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you do? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions,Professor, and now, I have twenty million reasons to do so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That's our first stop. Verify containment and initiateauto-destruct. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One more ship will make no difference in the here and now. Buttwenty two years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before itstarted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: A touch and go down warping? Mister Crusher, prepare to make itso. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used forexperiments, scientists would sometimes become attached to thecreatures. This would a problem if the experiment involved killingthem. I would suggest that you unattach yourself from the Borg, MisterLa Forge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Lysians have identified CommanderMacDuff as a Satarran, an alien race that's been at war with theLysians for decades. I have conveyed our deepest regrets to the Lysiansover the tragedy of their lost ship and crew. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We need a new captain and I've come to one inescapableconclusion <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Can you identify them? RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's all right, it's al right. I'm not going to hurt you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is at the heart of our nature to feel pain and joy. It is anessential part of what makes us what we are. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia ofhuman information without knowing a simple word like snoop? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I did. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Stay sharp everyone. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No names, no reason. Can you identify them, Vigo? If they comein a second time with our shields damaged <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant, myself most of all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go to half impulse power. Will you join me in theObservation lounge when you're done? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It is unlikely you are prepared to discussterms. It is more likely that this is an attempt at deception. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, I would not. Computer, display an internal schematicdiagram. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That will be all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You still haven't answered my question, Sarek. Is it logicalfor a Vulcan to cry? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then I declare the treaty in abeyance, <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Life form or not, intelligent or not , the safety of this shipand everyone aboard her is my primary responsibility. Data, evacuateall the air from the Medical Lab. I want a vacuum there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to shuttle, please respond. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll go into that later. Right now I mustspeak to Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let's just say my faith would be strengthened by a gesture fromyou, such as powering down your disruptors. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At last. How can we help? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. You can't go through with the ceremony. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailingfrequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The answer to all of this is feeding intoyour medical banks right now. Including a cure. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then, as Captain of the starship Enterprise, I ask you not tomake that sound. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You said you'd reviewed her journals for the past five years. Maybe we should go further back. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend, Ronin. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's happening, Mister La Forge? We're losing speed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At last. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're sure this is going to work? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. Set course to rendezvous with the Hood. Warpeight. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello, D'Tan. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security to Transporter room two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What progress on the matter-antimatter scan? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damaged? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Understood, Lieutenant, but I suspect that Commander Riker isprobably perfectly safe, at least in a physical sense. Q has aninterest in him. In fact, Q's entire visit has something to do with ourFirst Officer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. Apparently he's confined in some sort of force field. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Allow us safe passage and I will protect your right to privacyto the best of my ability. We will never tell anyone of your existence. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Bajorans did not attack Solarion Four. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking forbreakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse theprocess? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ship's status? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We don't have anything to do. None of the games are working. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damage? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In fact, it's more than likely that they will take good care ofher, if they want to use her as a bargaining chip. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, may I take off the uniform for a moment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We'll be on our way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're prepared to grant them independence? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Geordi, I understand how much we want, even need, toexplain an accident like this. Sometimes there just aren't anyexplanations. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At last. Did you read that book I gave you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will continue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tholl, what I want is for everyone to escape! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, take charge of the Doctor. Mister Data, shut downthe transmission. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Security alert, condition three. Computer, shut down alltransporter systems and shuttlebays. Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We've located the survivors from the Denver. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Inhibited, I suppose. But then, I'm not Wesley. And if you areconcerned about him, I see no evidence that there is a problem. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then he should be behaving very much better, don't you think? AStarfleet Captain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, Mister Worf, come with me. Number One, youhave the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How contagious is it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No need to report. I'm just here to do some work on my own. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Put that area on the main viewer. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: La Forge, set in warp one point five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, thank you. Everything is under control. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hail the Jovis. I want to speak with Kivas Fajo. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It wouldn't do any harm. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Their raids have made this sector unsafe. They've ransacked ourresearch facilities, our trade routes have been disrupted. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you man your station. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You agreed that she has a right to chooseher own future. The first chance you get you try to abduct her. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Speaking of disorientation, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Any response from Gravesworld, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is not in my power. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You may take whatever action against him you feel isappropriate. I consider the matter closed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Riker, we can carry out your repairs immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Sarek is dead. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see you keep up with our duty roster. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps we'll meet again. But next time, it will be outhere, among the stars. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Exactly when will they reach Haven? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And how shall you answer them tonight, Chancellor? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've been looking forward gagh. Haven't had it for quite awhile. Very fresh. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This situation has existed for a very long time. These twosocieties are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I came here to talk to Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Under the circumstances, I think there is only onedecision. I will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Beverly, how dangerous would another ridethrough the inverter be to us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jono, your Captain, Endar, has he ever hurt you? Inflictedpain? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then how can he turn his back on them so easily? How can heendorse reunification when it's considered subversive? 1 <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If the Enterprise medical facility can do anything to help. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, this vessel is about to undergo extensiverepairs requiring my personal supervision. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Have they found us? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. Go to Yellow Alert. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify yourself and return to theship immediately. Mister Worf, lock on with a tractor beam and returnit to the ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then that would explain why they abandoned it. But if there'sno one still living there, how were we brought inside? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know that part. RO <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Assure him that we are doing everything possible. And, advisehim that if necessary I will defend my ship. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see us one day becoming that, Q. Is it that what concernsyou? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates, plot a course into the chasm, manoeuvringthrusters only. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, we heard that, Number One. We'll try and track it downfrom here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You're mistaken, madam. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe that it was. Gentlemen, we have a way home. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How current is this information, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You get used to it. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign. It's all over me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What do you want from me? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. So once again, thank you for your help. Oh, I will besure to mention your name to Gowron when I speak to him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course for the Brechtian Cluster. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just happens. Whatis that smell? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I will not have you telling me what courseto set. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn. Sorry, Number One, what was that? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I hope you won't be late for your exams. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You won't mind if I don't take your word for it? Jared, withyour permission, I'd like Mister Data will review these scrollsthoroughly. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf, lock onto Major Rakal. Transport on mycommand. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Who were in danger? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No. Mister Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that couldbe a direct threat to the security of the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And more. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I haven't said yes yet. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, I think he is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Listen to me, Q. You seem to have some needfor humans. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. What is yoursituation? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And all your senses tell you that this woman here is the mostpowerful force on this planet, don't they? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: samples by tracing biochemical signatures, we'll be able todetermine who has been in this bay recently. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: That is remarkable. Why don't you play something? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Transporter room. lock on to the landing party. Beam them up. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Oh, by all means, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I've had enough of being led about this way. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had fullconfidence in me. But what if it were to change? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference willhave to be postponed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: An unfortunate reality. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are ready, Radue. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ro is on that ship? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Something of a tradition, Guinan. The Captain touring the shipbefore a battle. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be broughtto you there. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Don't touch him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And, you know, there's still a part of me that cannot acceptthat Q would give me a second chance, or that he would demonstrate somuch compassion. And if it was Q, I owe him a debt of gratitude. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Is there anything we can do to stop it? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Did you know it is now possible to predict the configuration ofa star system which won't be formed for another two million years? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Damn it, Geordi, you're going to kill yourself. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: And whom did you inform? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, when you feel up to it, would you join me in myReady room? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Home? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca Six. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: It's on page 244. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Deck seventeen? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If you wanted us to review your research, you should have madea request through the Science Council. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you believe him? I want a frank answer, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh ninehundred hours. We'll discuss it then. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What did you do to them, Q? Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Commander. Well done. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, no, not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What shall we play? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. I want you to prepare a class one probe. Set thesensors for maximum scan. I want every metre of Nelvana Threemonitored. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Romas, are you and T'Jon carrying this plague? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: We're not hunters, Doctor. Nor is it our role to exact revenge. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But without me you are not complete. I know you so well. Youlive for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter,pursuing me, forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Try to get more power to the field coils. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Captain Picard to Ensign Ro. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: One of my officers, one of my friends, was troubled. I had tohelp. Is Sarjenka safely home? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: No, you're not confused, Data. You're sensing the truth. Yourethical programmeis fighting the negative emotions that Lore is sending you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: The millions of people down there who are watching as theirmoon falls out of the sky. Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do you have battery backup? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: But we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with,largely thanks to Captain Riker. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fifteen thousand! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Computer, what was the last known location of Commander LaForge? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Prepare phasers and open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, there's plenty of time for that. You may decide to dosomething else as you get older. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Do not attack again! We are on a peacefulmission. Give your identity. You force us to defend ourselves. Phasersfull up. Arm torpedoes. Why aren't the shields at full power? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You see, the end is closer than you like to think. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Let me go! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What the hell is happening in Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Hello. Smells good. Thank you. Thisis a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Are youone of the crew? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. If this works, we may not have much time to preventthe power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely where to be and whatto do the very instant that time begins to move backwards. Captain's log, supplemental. After placing themodified tricorder on the Romulan ship, we have returned to theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you for a delicious meal. We must do this againsometime. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Eight? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: How is she? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: At all costs. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Which under most circumstances would be unconscionable. But asI see it, the Borg leave us with little choice. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Yes. This is very wrong. Neither of you should be reacting inthis way. Computer, locate Commander Data for me. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it toshape itself into whatever form you needed! <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Fine, but don't leave her unattended. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, sometimes the moral obligations of command are lessthan clear. I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs ofthe individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible. God knows, I don't always succeed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: My apologies if I interrupted a waltz. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Ready? Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Redblock. I have the item. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Well, usually you have to remind me, then badger me, andfinally order me to report. For once I thought I'd save you thetrouble. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I see. What do you intend to tell them? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, will you send another probe to the T-taurisystem? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: This is not the time. Damn it, even I can see the umbilicalcord is virtually uncut. The child, the child depends on him. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: For ambitious Starfleet officers, there are certain costsinvolved. One must be cautious of long-term commitments, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: There you are, Mister Tarses. Would you care for some lemon? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I believe that it would be premature to take that action,Mister Worf. There's no real evidence linking these comas with theUllians. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I agreed. All right then. Mister Worf, initiate your searchpattern. Let's head in. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: I'm sure she is. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Take him. And be careful, Number One. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course for Kaelon Two. Warp factor five. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open frequency, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Report to transporter room six immediately. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Anything from Gowron? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that bringshim. I will not endanger this ship under any circumstances. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: If this is Q I'm addressing, we are on a mission of rescuewhere a group of badly injured Q <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. Exit. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Even their deaths might have prevented this war. If theEnterprise-C returns to the battle and its mission is a success,history will be irrevocably changed. This time line will cease to existand a new future will have been created. I've considered thealternatives. I'll go with Guinan's recommendation. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: They're not dead. Communication is down, that's all. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: You took this weapon from the rebels? <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister La Forge, but you've done your job. Now Imust do mine. I relieve you, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> PICARD: What sort of thing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, what did you wish for, Will? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerfulman on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Human males are unique. Fathers continue to regard their sons aschildren, even into adulthood. And sons continue to chafe against whatthey perceive as their fathers' expectations of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talkabout. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All the ones I'm sure of, yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hi. Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Data. I don't seem to be much help without my empathicabilities. I just don't know how to draw on my human instinct. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It going to take about half an hour for thetransmission to be completed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, increase ambient temperature by two degrees Centigradeand increase relative humidity by ten percent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's lovely. I remember that sound, and all the good times wehad. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, when I first called you I was feeling intense pain. Nowit's gone, but I'm feeling a bit foggy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can hear you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How did you know? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We are members of a community. We all care for one another. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We see and hear you now. We didn't know you were there. You arebeautiful to us. All life is beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You may wait outside. Make certain we're not disturbed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're not playing it your way any more, N'Vek. I've beenkidnapped, surgically altered, put in danger I've gone along with allyour plans. Now you are going to listen to me. You find a way to letthe Enterprise track us, or I will go to Toreth and tell her I'vediscovered you're a traitor. I'll order you ejected into space. Is thatclear, Subcommander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg, as your former counsellor, I don't think it would beappropriate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's also possible that they just want to talk to us. I think weshould respond. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's time I accept the truth, Captain, and resign as ship'scounsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said you'd take me with you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When did this happen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg? May I join you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman. You thought that I would be this woman. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. It's just that thechoice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I'm hungry too. Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Listen to yourself. A few days ago you wouldn't even talk to us. This is my fault. I'm so sorry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you think he felt abandoned? After all, he left very soonafter K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother, he losthis father as well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, the issue isn't one of trust in Tam's intentions, but inhis judgment. I would trust him to do what he believes is right <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Scanners may show nothing, sir, but I'm sensing something verystrong. Thousands of minds. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get awayfrom him. She was afraid of him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why are you here? How did you know? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because if you're asking me if I liked what you were playing,then the answer is yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop this petty bickering, all of you! Especially you, Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will release no one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, we have to talk. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yet you covet his success. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you go in and get her back? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is our engine status, Ensign? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What does that mean? Is something doubled? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Roga Danar was an idealistic young man whoanswered his people's call to service. He joined the military to fightfor the Angosian way of life. What he didn't realise was that by doingso he would have to give up that way of life for ever. He's not thesame man who left home to go to war. He's been through intensepsychological manipulation and biochemical modifications. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why do I think you're upset? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's that supposed to mean? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Isabella, it's not very nice to get Clara to do things that sheisn't supposed to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Understood. What about Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you can ask the question, I'd say no. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have an imaginary friend? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't believe this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How so? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My God, you've been shot! Computer, end programme. Troi toCaptain Picard. Troi to Security. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps, for an instant. It was like their voices were beingcarried on the wind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This isn't real. None of this is real. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One moon circles. That's what they've been telling me over andover. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Groppler Zorn, sir. A great fear just ahead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This deck is devoted mainly to stellarcartography, biological research, and astrophysics. We have over athousand people on board <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why would you come aboard at a time likethis? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What does she say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet, you want acompanion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. No. I just don't know if I'm ready to give up my life here. Maybe we both need some time. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have they? Commander Riker and his father are in the gymnasium,about to engage in barbarism of their own. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We also come in search of possible survivors from one of ourfreighters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unresponsive? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: On that subject Mother, there is such a thing as too much honestywith humans. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not a dream. It's real. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Barclay, you're exhausted and highly agitated, and Icannot allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others. Ithink <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How many people were on that ship? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's just hope, Beverly. Not false hope. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will come onto your ship. Please, lower yourshields and prepare to beam me aboard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want to suggest something. Call it a theory, all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You think we sent ourselves a message? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, let us see Thomas Raymond. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want to do it, Captain. Something awful happened to me and Idon't even know what it was. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really? Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Data <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense no unusual reaction, Captain. After all, such a change ishardly out of the ordinary. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wish they weren't necessary. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, sir, there is. I was debating whether to mention it,and perhaps. It's about Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have to forgive yourself, Mother. You have to let go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness,serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that youhope to draw out in others. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can understand your concern, Ensign Sutter, but really you havenothing to worry about. It's a normal, healthy activity for children toengage in imaginary play. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing else since? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Since his records show no previous mention of that, the fact thatit's happened now could be important. But all I sense from him isconfusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If he's lying, I haven't been able to sense it. Perhaps hisemotional trauma level is too high. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It never happened to me before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Meet me in Transporter room three at nineteen hundredhours. It's important. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, come on, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. Ishould take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time I'll choosethe programme. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love LakeCataria on Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This seems to be some kind of meeting place. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In many ways he's suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes toinvolve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called R'uustai, the Bonding <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your self portrait is so practiced, so polished. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Here it comes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Memory or nightmare? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The other day, when I told you about how Commander Riker and Ididn't meet on Risa, what I didn't say was how disappointed I was. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's getting much, much colder, sir. How far down is it likely togo? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: On a straight line to the cosmic string. You're convinced thestring's gravitation is pulling them in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you remember when the Enterprise hit that quantum filament andI was in command on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why don't you try, Jake? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aaron. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was as though you were performing a scene for all of us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's possible. But she may really believe she's in love with him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are a non-violent man, yet you committed acts of excessiveviolence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Last night, while I slept, something which I can only describe asa presence, entered my body. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure this is what you want? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You mean some emotion buried in your psyche? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If there's anything else I need, I know where to find you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's not guess what might have been. I love my work aboard theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf. From what I understand, there's a good chance my Worf won'treturn. I guess it's just hard for me to accept that there's a realityout there where you never loved me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do we know what caused the breach? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is she behind here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mrs. Carmichael. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They have what they want. For now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The secondary plasma vent has a tripleredundant bypass. Which means that the primary access junction isrouted through <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then give me time to find it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If they send him back. Ensign Rager still hasn't been returned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month,talking with Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who have you been talking to? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I'm not feeling very well. I'd like to go to myquarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It would take time. One of your days. He is immune to ourinfluence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I find him very reasonable. Open to suggestions, thoughtful,quite disarming. The perfect administrator. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Clara. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense deliberate concealment, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Could we divert energy from the Bridge to those monitors? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions ofthe beast. We lose our way and get swept up in emotion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have no idea how frightening it is to just be here withoutsensing you, without sharing your feelings. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Listen to me, Will. In all the years we've known each other, haveI ever lied to you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor ! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To be honest, I'm not sure what happened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How was his job performance? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander, perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to takeMister Clemens to his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Min was beautiful, of course, strong, intelligent, patient. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archivethat seems bent on taking us over? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect to findanyone up except Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He may have been curt, but he was also very worried and even alittle scared. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wonderful! Wonderful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wait. What happens at Keystone City? Why are you taking the brickthere? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. And we gave it to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They made you human as part of your punishment? Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In every Western I've ever read, the villains always break theirword. he can't be trusted. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you like it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just want to take a quick look. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. I think it would. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Excuse me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your father? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense the weight of this duty on you,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now, Data, you remember the psychotronicstability examination. We all had to take it before graduating from theAcademy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, what did you want? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, do we have a link up to the Angosiancentral computer? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jeremy, I know your mother loved you very much. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's funny, I thought most doctors were people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, no, I'm fine. It's just I feel before we continue it'simportant you know that. Okay? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're letting it get you much too upset. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What I sense of them is human. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hired gun? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I believe so. Like a thought, but rather mechanical in nature. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Okay. Anybody in here? Looks pretty empty to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I already have a job as Counsellor. If you want to know what happens to Arridor and Kolin the Delta Quadrant, here is thetale. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> TROI: I know of him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Such as sadness <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. The Admiral was very pleased when you chose that name. He isa wonderful boy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I know the best thing to do is to gradually wean her awayfrom her fantasy, and she did make some new friends today and had agood time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't I wish. This is from Alexander. He gave it me just beforehe left to visit your parents. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're taking it so seriously. It's not without its element ofhumour. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've no idea who she is? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Eyes in the dark. That's what the voice said in my dream. Is thatwhere you heard it? In a dream? Over and over? Beverly, I know what itis. I know what's happening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard wanted me to find out if you'd be willing to helpus retrieve the station's database. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did she tell you about the father-son field trip this afternoon? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, yes, of course, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And that was disturbing to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sensed you suddenly felt uncomfortable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We stayed in Ten Forward talking for hours. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was he prone to mood swings or depression? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, not him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wish you were truly as open-minded as you say, Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's lying. They have no intention of keeping theirword. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can we tighten the pattern further? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It doesn't say here what he was arrested for. Call up hismilitary record. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh. No, no, I'm fine. I'm just very tired, that's all. Will I seeyou tomorrow? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. I know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You want me to raise Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That is why you haven't been on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you still angry with her? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wyatt, I'm happy for you, and for Ariana too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, where did you, when did you meet this man? Who is he? Imean, marriage? When did all this happen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you are father and daughter, you may well have shared the samedream. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You, sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I was just looking over some personnel files. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, don't start. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Leave me alone! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All kinds. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Again? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Activate forward disruptor array. Fire when ready. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This situation is deteriorating, Captain. Thepeople are approaching levels of anxiety that could lead to suicide. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I hope I see you soon. Maybe we can be friends. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. Shefrightens me, Will. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent. They're out of proportion. They're evil. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think you've lost a thing, and I think you've gained morethan you realise. You're much more comfortable with yourself than youused to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's happening? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please, don't be alarmed at our appearance. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The double bars indicate an elongated S sound. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What you're doing here is miraculous. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg, you were faced with a difficult transport. Anyone would havebeen apprehensive in that situation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: At your service. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because there are lives at stake, Mrs. Jameson. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm glad to be of service. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why have you kept it a secret? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because as I said, I knew you would not believe us. Even now, Iknow you don't. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean, quantum realities? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to get a message to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When was the last time you saw her? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We'll make sure Isabella isn't anywhere around, okay? Come on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Whatever's wrong, whatever happened, I want you to know that Ibelieve you. And that I love you. And together we'll find out what'shappening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. An animal is always at its best when hunted. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know it sounds unusual, but it is understandable. Technically,it's called enantiodromia. Conversion intothe opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotionalto being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He'sjust found a new way to suppress it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My grandfather rarely spoke. He said that was for off-worldersand people who didn't know any better. Now the only time I can rememberhis stories is when I go home and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes whenI'm alone there, it's almost as if I can hear his voice inside my head. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a possibility. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're empathic? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's possible. Children don't have the experience to handleemotional crises. Instead of dealing with their feelings, they act onthem. Tell me about the last time you spoke with K'Ehleyr, the nightshe died. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You could return to the Academy. Take another degree. Brush up onyour Latin. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there's something I have to tell you. Doctor Crusher hasbeen hit by a disruptor blast at point blank range. If time returns tonormal I don't see how she can survive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe we could do something to help Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no need. You're not responsible for what he did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, the situation down there has changed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your middle name. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because I want to help, if I can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing will harm you, I promise. Just tell us how you recogniseit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You were honest with him, Mother. You had to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: By the way. The next time you call me aristocratic. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: Admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to youfor guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How can we be of help? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How's it going? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You could have easily been right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Were you able to help Tasha? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I suddenly became dizzy. I'd think I'd better go to my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's not what I meant. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As you can see, there are three other planets in this sector thathave environmental conditions similar to those here on Dorvan Five. They're all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. He worshipped you. But I don't think I'll ever learn to seemen the way you do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It might be the message we've been looking for. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've gone over every word, every inflection, every facialresponse, and I still can't find any kind of code or hidden message. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They destroyed their own invasion force. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, you'll work verbally too. The point is for you to get somerest, mother. Besides, it'll do them good to have to figure things outwith words. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's okay. Close your eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I doubt that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's pretty selfish of you. Do you think you're the only one inpain? Do you think you have the monopoly on loss? Well, let me tell yousomething. We're all hurting, and we're all angry. And whether you likeit or not, you have a responsibility to this crew, and you can't justindulge your personal desire for revenge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you know that's not true. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Time well spent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, emergency procedure. Eject antimatter storage unitthree. Authorisation, Troi omega omega three one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Talking about it would help you understand your response. I'mgoing to find out if anyone else on the ship has had these kind ofexperiences. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We need to talk. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, may I speak with you a moment inprivate? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, if I may recommend? With our attention on the Ferengivessel, we have ignored the planet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We certainly have. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She has an incredibly focused mind. It was virtually impossibleto sense any deception. Or anything else, for that matter. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd say he's beginning the process of letting go of that fantasy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You will keep me informed of our progress. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you do it from here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I doubt they see of you as an amateur. Not when it comes to TagusThree. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Klingon culture is not in your taste? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're worried. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And that's all? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not easy having an overbearing parent. Believe me, I knowhow you feel. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now he's hurting me no. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, we've got another problem. I saw Eli playing cards. He wasshuffling the way Data does when he plays poker. He doesn't just looklike Data, he has Data's abilities. Which means his father probablydoes also. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, he doesn't understand you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Too often, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And we still can't even say hello to these people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, Captain, almost no one is born being a good parent. Most people just have to muddle through and do the best that they can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This must be very strange for you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're probably drawing on feelings that you're not used toexpressing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You'd feel better if you did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There are methods of treatment. Until you try them, how can youknow they won't work? Even a partial recovery could give them somepeace. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I'm just not sure she wants to escape. It's the only way oflife she's ever known. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly, you're in love. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was holding you down? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanishoverlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there. Ifhe's right it may mean that she's suffered some kind of trauma that hermetaconscious just can't tolerate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really? What was it like? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Anticipation is fun. We'll be late for dinner. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You were together? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The growth rate's almost down to zero. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain. Yhatyou're fighting something. What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have not established their intentions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean? you can't leave? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I ask why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Night Bird! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not. Computer, champagne. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They didn't take everything away. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge that will allowme to access my mother's metaconscious. If he can, I might be able tofind out what happened to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because you are intelligent, wise and quite correct. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think they represent different aspects of the ship. TheEngineer, for instance, may represent the navigational system, thegunslinger could be the weapon system. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you know why you did it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you serious? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have never felt anything quite like this before, so it'sdifficult to put into words. That person is you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Security. Code one emergency. Security! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lower the forcefield. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nara. She's his superior officer in the nacelle tube? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ha! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't worry she'll be fine. This is something I think you'll findinteresting. It's a jewel plant from Folnar Three. The plant secretes aresin which is collected within the blossom. By the time the bloom hasfaded, the resin has hardened into a rare and beautiful gem. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Does it have to be today? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not that I recall. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We are. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sometimes. This must be what Mother felt about you. I believe wecould read each other eventually. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It doesn't feel right to leave while Beata is determined toexecute those people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I suggest working out an equitable system with the rules clearlyspelled out. For the child and the parent. You must make a list of yourresponsibilities, too. What would you like your father to promise,Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long did you spend in each time period? Did it seem likeminutes, hours? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ever since the Bajorans overpowered the Cardassian Empire,they've become more and more aggressive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Daddy? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! He shouldn't be here. Why is he here? Stop! You're hurtingme. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Anything familiar?  JEAN-LUC <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, you're undermining every effort we're trying to makehere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, the fact that they're not responding doesn't necessarilymean there's anything wrong. The atmospheric disturbance could bejamming the signal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was once a little more than that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think I'd better clear my calendar for the next few weeks. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: You're still a Starfleet captain. I'm sure there are otherassignments you could be given in the interim. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is blinding me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have to help her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened, Mother. What happened next? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? Because I'm not the most technically-minded person on theship? I may have trouble telling the difference between a plasmaconduit and a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officerthan memorising technical manuals. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Durango. I'm called Durango. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know it as well as I do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hard at work? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well done. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of warmthand friendship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, lights! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, I', sensing a presence on the planet. Very vague. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't like the sound of this, mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! Don't! No! No! Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She died two years ago. A shuttle accident. I'm sorry, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, if you're still confused tomorrow, you know where my officeis. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: Oh? What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here. Thenthey asked you to keep secrets from your superiors. Effectively, todisobey Starfleet regulations. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Clearly, your father was a traitor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's it, sir. It's just one alien that I'm sensing here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Come on, Eric. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's er, very different. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, my God. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But the vaccine is important in this case, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where was Lieutenant Kwan's station? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, when I'm ready for bed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hard to say. Someone is hiding something, but I can't tell who orwhat. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Should I? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children oftheir own. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your arm. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And to you. Perhaps everyone just needs some time. Time for youto get to know and trust the crew, and time for them to understand howyou want things done. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We were orbiting Angosia when you escaped from Lunar Five. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You were waiting for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand this. The story should be over. What's left? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you didn't like people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Could the colonists have escaped? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think it's too serious yet, but we should make more of aneffort to get her involved with real friends her own age. Thechildren's centre's having a ceramics class this afternoon. Why don't Itake Clara? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hail them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't remember seeing these during my empathic experience. Havethey been here since the ship was built? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really thought you'd tell me you were an artist. I just feltyour mind very much on these. They are your work, aren't they? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. What happened to you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, create a restraining arm attached to the right side ofthe table, at the mid-point. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Zalkonians truly don't understand our indecision aboutreturning John. In their eyes, we shouldn't even be involved. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't turn away. You have a chance to make some good come out ofthis tragedy. This could be the catalyst which binds them together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know I won't. I've been really looking forward to a nice swim. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. No life form anything like us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. I thought you were brilliant. You've changed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's hard to believe. So much loveliness here, just a few metresaway from such desolation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Frankly, I'm envious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's true. I'm sorry, and I didn't mean to get so upset withyou at the reception. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That was a long time ago. Many things have changed, includingTomalak. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me. Whatever it is. we can face it together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others. Armus, you have me. Let them go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maques believes my mother's psyche has collapsed in on itself. That for some reason, she has retreated into her metaconscious mind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd be honoured. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You cannot apply human style logic to this, Captain. A Betazoidwoman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful, should youspurn any such advances. She would take it personally. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps I should tell you something about my mother's conditionat this time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, it's just not the same. Have you ever been for a realmoonlight swim? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Help me! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm aware of that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, please, we should listen to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They were not welcome here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And that you were causing it now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is the stimulation preventing the infection from taking hold? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why me? You could have found a Romulan to play this role. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If I go with you and hold your hand, will you go into your room? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your opinion of the Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will. Captain's log, stardate 46073.6. We have arrivedwithout incident at Rekag-Seronia, where two members of AmbassadorAlkar's delegation have been waiting. They have joined us to report onthe situation in the capital city. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've been glowing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly, can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Chance? What chance? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A suitable guide for what? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm restless. Mind if I visit for a while? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried aboutmaking mistakes, and they need some encouragement. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Night Bird. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? Troi to Sickbay. Medical emergency in the arboretum. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, it matters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a part of the Betazoid psyche. It's a kind of filteringmechanism that protects us from psychic trauma. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You want them to dislike you. Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Am I too late? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's enough! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know if I can believe that. It took me a long time to getover what happened between Commander Riker and me. I don't know that Iwant to put myself in that position again. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's why you left Earth. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I suppose in a way it is. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And certain resourceful young Ensigns. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's see if we can find out. Computer, this is Counsellor Troi. Request personal history on. What are their names? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That, too <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Captain, but Doctor Stubbs is waiting outside. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard to talkright now, but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a fewthings about him. When was the last time you saw him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Timothy, perhaps you and I should go below and get out ofeveryone's way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think so. My mother never mentioned her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I want you to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Among other things, his relationship with his father. No moreholodeck, Mother. Please. And why aren't you all absorbed in yourwedding plans? It's only three days away. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's what I don't understand. Even though I couldn't read hisemotions, I did feel that he was holding something back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm concerned our new passengers. Their emotions do notfit who they are and what they're doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ultimately, Jenna will care for you for what you are, not whatyou imitate out of a book. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I'm fine, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's getting weaker, isn't he? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then it's possible they may have changed over the years. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really have to finish this. I have some appointments thisafternoon. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He saw faces he didn't recognize, events he couldn't interpret. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He can't answer that. None of us can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How much time do we have? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. Well, let's go for our walk, shall we? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Shouldn't Doctor Pulaski be involved in this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd like that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because, sir, I assumed at first it was the kind of duality weBetazeds feel in all of you. Even you, sir. When you approach adecision and ask yourself which way to go, who are you talking to? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As Ship's Counsellor, I offer my assistance. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no police record. What did you do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure you know what he wants? That's the problem withbelieving in a supernatural being. Trying to determine what he wants. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Most Betazoids born like that never lead a normal life. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, are you alright? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And he was very odd with me afterwards. He wanted me to warn himif the crew started to lose confidence in him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you'reconcerned about dishonour? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That was going to be my question. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, the level of tension on the ship is mounting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Vulcans have the same basic emotions we do. They've justlearned to repress them. What I sensed during the concert was that he'dlost control. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not really, but <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, do you exist in combination with this entity? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's right. It is important that you be able to make the claytake the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to beconcentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on thefeelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what doyou think about when you see a bird? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We cannot risk an engagement here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the PrimeDirective. True, they are not actual allies, but <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We deal with our pain in many different ways, but over the yearsI've discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individualis revealed. If I can help a person back to a state of joy, well, myrole has its rewards. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yum. Next we're going to go to deck eight, which is interestingbecause it's not really finished. It's sort of a multi-purpose deck. Sometimes when we need an extra lab or. Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Visionaries who don't see this planet as it is, but as it willbe. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain. We're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight. Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I just thought I'd come and see how you were doing. A lot'shappened in the last few hours. I thought you might like to talk aboutit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But if you hadn't been, what would have happened between us? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I remember. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A restraint of some kind? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you toconsider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss. Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion ofcloseness and romance. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ambassador, I think we're going to get along very well. Shall we? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I believe so. Sunad's hatred for John was evident but there'ssomething else. The Zalkonians are afraid of John. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard could be dead by then. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Frame of Mind? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Whatever you choose will be yours for your lifetime. It's adecision that will affect how people interrelate with you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, it's just that Commander Riker's emotions are ratherpassionate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've come with some important information. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why are you doing this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All decks report ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Down in the valley. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm your Counsellor. You brought mewith you to Ligon to be of help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How's it going, Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, he's not. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm proud of you, Reg. I'm glad for you, too. Well, I'd better begoing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which one? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello. My name is Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And Liva? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The capital city. He was under the name of Rivas Jakara, atourist from the Marta community. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: An end to pain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His signal? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Listen <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped for. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My mother is beginning a physiological phase. It's one that allBetazoid women must deal with as they enter mid-life. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're sure my being here is not going to bedisruptive? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My nightmare. It's not a dream. It's not a dream at all. It's amessage. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have you dreamt about scissors recently? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have a lot to talk about, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I had a very strange visit from one of yourofficers today. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, I was going to suggest something else. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What we want is to get the dissidents to safety. Now answer thequestion. Is there a way? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I feel your confidence, your arrogant resolve. It excites me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How much time do we have? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can understand that. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you. You tend tosuppress them. There are a few hours until we arrive. Perhaps youshould use this time to analyse your feelings and put them intoperspective. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Geordi was talking about what it felt like to touch theplasma field and you were taking a sip of tea. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, belay that order. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, these people have been isolated for three hundred years. They could be very unsophisticated. The shock of suddenly beingtransported onto a spaceship could frighten them, to say the least. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A Federation starship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What about? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, we can't just leave you here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're worried about the disappearance of your mother, guiltythat you didn't see her when you had the chance, so you're unwilling toconsider that she might be dead. Your need to believe she's alive is sostrong that it manifests itself as a physical image. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's not Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hold on. I was just passing through town, saw a little trouble,thought I'd lend a hand. But I ain't one of your deputies, Sheriff. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are you? I'm coming. Where are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why would your real mother want you to go down to the planet? There's nothing there but dust and rocks. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can speculate on the available evidence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I meant, how's it going with you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, they apply to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry but I can't dismiss those lives so easily. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I heard about Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're lying. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, you can join us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much,that they're afraid we won't part with it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am flattered. I too am look forward to learning more about you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We did not take Palmer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's good to be back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To admit that you're afraid gives you strength. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's after more than a history lesson. I can tell you that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. Hello, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't want to interfere with your personal life, but unresolvedstrong emotion can affect judgement. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It wasn't what I saw, it was more what I felt. I looked into themirror, and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind myown eyes. As if my face was a mask. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can I have a glass of water? It's so cold inhere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no strangerthan what you're eating. Have you noticed howdry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls areset properly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just thought you'd like some time alone. I'll see you later. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's perfectly normal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you wish you had said? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He must have thought you would have wanted it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm sensing a powerful mind.  TORRES <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. I'm sure youhave to meditate, or hit yourself with a pain stick or something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Delicious? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was wrong not to tell you, Captain. And your decision may alsobe wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But we have asked the mining settlement to send any vessels theymight have. You know, there are many reasons why the shuttlecraft mayhave been delayed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Any or all, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Heading one oh two mark four. And she'll take orders from me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I accept. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do not authorise this attack. You will cease battle operationsimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Admiral Picard offered me a position at Starfleet Command. It wasa tremendous opportunity. I couldn't refuse. But, what's importantright now, today, is that you have a son who needs you. Spend time withhim. You may find part of what you've lost. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There are a lot of people still alive. Many of them are hurt butI can't tell where they are. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, valerian root tea, hot. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not specifically, but there are two things that seem unusual. Thebartender is an artificial lifeform. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm more interested in how you feel about what happened. I sensegreat anger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wedding gown? Mother, stop. You're telling me you're not going tobe naked at your own wedding? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Or more. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's possible, but I don't see how it could have happened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for thisone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The man that he is. Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe it died. It has been a few years. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're all more than the sum of our parts, Data. You'll have to bemore than the sum of your programming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You still talk to it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She mentioned how much she was looking forward to seeing youagain, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Subspace signals, photon torpedoes, nothing's had an impact. Itis reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull, even as strong as acosmic string's, would affect them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, it really is quite late. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there any indication of temporal displacement? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've asked myself that question a lot during the past few days. Idon't know. I doubt it. Nevertheless, it's what they believe in, and itwon't be an easy matter to talk them into leaving. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How did this happen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When you were a child, did you have any friends? Other childrenyou played with? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, this is not an isolated incident. There have beenreports of random violence all over the ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What kind of transmissions? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well then you should have no trouble with that part. Why not goback to your quarters and talk this thing over? Decide on which points each of you wants in the contract. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Given in to what? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would urge caution. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor Stubbs, I know how much this means to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Give it time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I need to talk to your father, Jean-Luc. Would you mind leavingus alone for a moment? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You will plot a course for the Draken System. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That was an incredible programme. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, everything you did was consistent with establishedStarfleet procedures. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But confused. This Picard pattern was formed before he went outthere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His world is gone, Data. We're going to have to help him build anew one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can feel that. I know you care, within those limits. Did youhear what I said? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My hair. I was brushing my hair. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me about her. I want to know everything. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: No, what I mean is, Commander Riker and I never did. You see, heearned a promotion very quickly. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is Lieutenant Worf all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm still here. I haven't gone anywhere. Do you remember anything more? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you remember what I taught you, Imzadi? Can you stillsense my thoughts? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there areresidual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violentlyby the Borg. Kidnapped, assaulted,mutilated. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll go to my quarters. I think it would be best if I stayed outof the way of the Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Somebody left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact, and ithas something very similar to this. And you don't know anything aboutit? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, buttheirs continues to elude us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't wish that, Beverly. You can't be open to love if you don'trisk pain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sensed the same thing, Captain. He's hiding something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there something we can do to help? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tam is a telepath of extraordinary talent,even for a Betazoid. He's a specialist in first contact with new lifeforms. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said you felt a touch. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can no longer fulfill my obligations. What other option isthere? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think that will be necessary. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All right. This hand, the game is Federation Day. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would help him find a way to secure our trust. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is this Tagus Three? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor Kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat,but she's not telling us the whole truth. I recommend caution. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am happy. Why can't you believe that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Security override, authorisation Troi Delta two nine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tasha? Tasha, wait. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've never tried it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That doesn't make any sense. He knows those codes would have beenchanged as soon as he was captured. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Take a break. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who was responsible? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What I sensed before hasn't changed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is Ensign Calloway, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tam. Stop this! You're losing yourself in this this merging. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You wanted her to suffer. You have a great need. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It will just gauge your psychological reactions to the images itprojects. Watch the screen and let your mind go blank. The device willdo the rest. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, Ensign. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She called out to me. She does want me to help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man, a fatherfigure with whom he can explore his origins. And I think it should beyou, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought I heard one of the Engineers say something about apower transfer. Something about an energy feedback. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You had a good time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, where are your new quarters? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, if you were one of my human patients, I might be concernedright now. I'd say you had a waking dream or an hallucination. Butyou're not human. I think we might be looking at some kind oftechnological problem. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd be happy to. But first, I'd like to talk about how the changein command is affecting the crew. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm looking forward to it. Break a leg. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm fine. If I get better, I get better. If I don't, I'll adapt. Life goes on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have you ever heard Data define friendship? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. You needn't worry about a thing. So, tell meeverything you know about Vertiform City. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He is a life force entity. When we passed each other in space, hewas curious about us, so he decided the best way to learn was to gothrough the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that wayto understand us. He never meant any harm. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have never attempted anything like this before. When dealingwith two factions so diametrically opposed, so entrenched in theirpositions, where do you start? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you know how to deactivate this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, actually, in my hallucination, you were killed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How well do you remember your mother? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There have been some, did he say low intensity? Some unusual lowintensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He may be injured. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's wonderful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So you're no longer a human? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend taking himTROI <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have your sensors indicated any problem down there,Lieutenant? WORF <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jev, you're upset. Would you like to talk? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Humans no longer own each other that way, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you really think this has a chance of succeeding? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain is well aware of the gravity of the situation,Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You will enjoy this one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There aren't any others. Currently. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want to know anything you can tell me that could help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise yourson. My concern right now is how this decision is going to affect you. How will you feel when Alexander's gone? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? What's happening? It's happening again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It must be. The dominant personality is unstable. Brilliant butvain, sensitive yet paranoid. And I believe it is prone toirrationality. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it would be in your best interest to take a leave ofabsence. Reg, I'm temporarily relieving you of duty. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all right. I'm fine. He was just trying to communicate withme telepathically. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One can see the importance of honour here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that why you killed the Engineer? To get this brick? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's understandable, sir. Sharing an orbit with God is no smallexperience. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's impossible. He's been in prison. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, it's all right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's good to be back. The last two weeks have been gruelling. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record. I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months afterFinn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers havesufficiently developed, he will be able to articulate it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander, wait! It's the Captain. But only the Captain. He's outthere alone! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've come to you first because you're a leader in the scientificcommunity. Scientists generally accept our arrival more easily thanothers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, even Freud said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. But thebottom line is, I think you're developing an almost obsessive interestin your own inner workings. I'd almost call it the beginnings of aneurosis. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have no way idea what the result would be. The symbol mightgenerate anything from Korgano's temple to Korgano himself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do you feel at this moment, as you lean over him to take thespecimen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, don't you think it would be a good idea if you actuallymet the man you're going to marry before committing to spend the restofyour life with him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said there was no way to stabilise the containment field fromthe Bridge. Could it be done from Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted badlyto one another. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He walked me to my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wanted to apologise for my mother's behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I suppose I did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, thank you for coming to talk to us. I'll see you later, allright? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is it really so complicated? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, when the treaty was first negotiated the Federation sentthree hundred and seventy two legal experts. What do we have? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He was left here. Abandoned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Purple omelettes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But it's not real. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come on. You can do it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Careful, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions andembrace love, truth, joy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Only so you'd think about it, completely and clearly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tam? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, that's only natural. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Code Forty Seven. Captain's eyes only. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you don't tell them so you can gain an advantage. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aaron. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was just visiting. We'll talk again soon, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Welcome home, Worf. I hope you don't mind, I let myself in. I promisedAlexander I'd feed his Dalvin hissing beetle while you were both away. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want toreveal. As ship's counsellor, you have to get them to talk about thingsthey don't want to reveal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you let something happen to someone? Was it here at El'nar? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That isn't true. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hedril, I asked your father to bring you herebecause I wanted to talk to you about something. You know thatLwaxana's sick, don't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh yes we would. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There are over a thousand lifeforms on this vessel. How could youassure their silence? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is conceivable. When working with patients with debilitatingnightmares, I've often used atherapeutic treatment called directed dreaming. Dreamers can learn tocontrol of their dreams, retain a conscious memory even while in REMsleep. I could remember a short message and deliver it to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, of course she is. I have no wish to harm her or to harmanyone else. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She just left my quarters, <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Keep talking to me. I'll try to understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That cargo is the property of the Tal Shiar. You will not touchit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you should know he and I have had a prior relationship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there anything we can do to help? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is his last entry. He made it before going on duty thismorning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then if some types of endorphins attract them <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, they can track us. So if we attack them, they will returnfire. And since we have no shields when we're cloaked, they willdestroy us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Imzadi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. And I understand this means a great deal to you. But youmust be prepared. He's very angry too, but his anger is deep insidehim. When he touches it, it will strike out in many directions,including yours. Be with him. Talk to him. But don't rush this. Whenhe's ready, we'll know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you move us again? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Premier. There's something you should know. I'm sorry,was there something you wanted to say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And will you provide for his education, his health, his growth, acareer, a wife? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just need some rest. Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll see to that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now we're hearing some truth. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ready, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense awakening memories in the boy. This is a very fragiletime for Jono. If we send away the man he calls father without evenletting them see each other, how will we ever gain his trust? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's alright. I'm getting used to it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's Will Riker. That's right. I was thinking of him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you spell knife with a K. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, you do need time. You cannot achieve complete recoveryso quickly. And it's perfectly normal, after what you've been through,to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said those exact words to me before you went to serve on thePotemkin. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingonword for jolly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, this is my mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: With whom? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, halt. Captain, I have to tell you something, and itisn't easy for me because I've used very poor judgement. Actually, I'veacted quite unprofessionally. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps you'd like to share your reasoning on that, sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do remember. I always felt safe when you sang to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They could have been on a scientific voyage. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but sixteen years. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Go on. You've wanted to tell him for a long time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, how much <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You didn't know? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. What he wants most is to captain a starship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you will approve. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ambassador, I'm curious. Now does your species procreate? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know how to describe it. I wassuddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic. And thesensations didn't seem to be coming from any person. They were justthere, in the room. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come and sit down. I just want you to relax for a minute. There. You are sotense. Now, I know you don't want to talk about what happened on theBridge, but there are times when it's just best to let things out. Comeon. If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings,yours and mine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't sound very convinced of that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, don't. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I haven't been able to stop thinking about you all day. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll watch the door. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In a way that pleases people who care about your happiness, yes,it is. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's a good question, Data. I wish I had a good answer for you. Perhaps when they're ready, they will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please, we're your friends. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's happening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Three jacks looking back for the handsome young ensign. Pair of deuces stands. Flush, possible straight flush. Yourbet, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now goodnight, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ian, say hello to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind must have takenelements from my own life and then created a situation that in manyways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, Iwould have jumped just like he did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't approve of genetic engineering. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said you were uneasy when you sat down at the conn. position. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just find it interesting. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the man whocouldn't be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have you discussed this with Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as LieutenantKwan? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf we were supposed to have lunch together, remember? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Strange, isn't it? You'll travel light years, dodge asteroidstorms, brave hostile aliens, and yet when asked to assume a parentalrole, you cringe. Why do you suppose that is? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. I hope so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You feel what anyone in your position would feel. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That man said he was laying a foundation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And when you find someone attractive, what do you usually do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Run programme. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your discovery has produced a great deal of excitement, Premier. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I take great exception to your decision to beam down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, then I'll take it four times, or fourteen times, or howevermany times are necessary for me to get it right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What would have happened if she couldn't stop it? Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We mustn't do this. Will, don't. Will, no! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, I now feel anger from our Captain. Furyover whatever it is he is reliving out there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's Ian. Hurry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Exactly! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I look forward to that time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe. Will and I have been talking about going back to AngelFalls. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Need? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So you're trying to establish a dominant position by making himwait for you. The trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight fordominance, one of them ends up dead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's something's here. I feel it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a longtime ago? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am sensing an emotional presence, Captain. I would normallydescribe it as being terrified. Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There isn't time. He's dying. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's impossible. The Romulans use an artificial quantumsingularity as their power source. Once it's activated, it can't beshut down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In a sense, you did give Moriarty what he wanted. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me about her, this new woman. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Private man. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We improvised, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The mission is one of utmost secrecy. I could not risk bringingguards. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander Riker has become tense. Closed in, he's feelingtrapped. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We had business dealings. He owes me money. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All decks acknowledging, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes sir. It is not merely a vessel, sir. Somehow it is alive. Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's a start. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Cancel them. Cancel everything till after lunch. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Artificial gravity well? Do you mean the Romulan engine core? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg, why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It seems you've all had a similar experience. Is there anythingelse you remember besides a table? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, they may know as little about us as we do about them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very well. We're taking you to our crash site. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now what? Yes, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. You, the wolf, my father. It was though she were summoningall her defences to keep me away. But keep me away from what? What isshe protecting? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that youcan't answer for him. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The facts are the Ferengis did fire at us, but we were chasingthem. Since then, all they've done is searched our computers, trying tolearn who and what we are. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aaron, you acted in the best interests of your people. There wasno way to avoid what happened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think what we've gained far outweighs anything that might havebeen lost. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: At least this way, he'll be alive in the other time frame. Wemight have a chance to save him later. Is the Romulan still alive? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion. Helps them begin the healing process. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm fine, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is stretched so tight the tension fills this room. And if youfinally fail, I fear it will snap. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Homn said he saved it in case someday you wanted toremember her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why would you create this fantasy? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sometimes it's healthy to explore the darker sides of the psyche. Jung called it owning your own shadow. This could be a sign that you'rea real actor. This is becoming more than just a role to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, it's your great, great, great, great, great grandson. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now! DATA <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The agreement isn't valid, sir. It wasn't Q that saved us. Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So am I. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not certain of that now, Captain. I do sense somethingunusual. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Dokachin, we must find this ship and you're the only onewho can help us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're concerned. We're afraid whatever happened on the Brittainmay be starting here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ten generations of your progeny. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't have to tell me, Beverly. I understand the psychology. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, how did you know about this place? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All right. Switch the EM power inverter to the lateral. No, wait. Use the neodyne relay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's so silly. I hear music. In my mind. Music that won't stop. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's not what I asked. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The strange thing is I couldn't read him atall. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander La Forge said you seemed a little nervous this morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to tell her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've learned to remind myself that my mother and I are twoseparate individuals. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've smelled better viinerine on prison ships. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Security to Lieutenant Worf's quarters, immediately. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His feelings towards you are very warm. He's attracted to you inmany ways. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm not really dressed for areception. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's see. Anything here? Maybe Isabella knows that you've gotnew friends now. In fact, I'll bet she won't be coming around as muchanymore. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I remember. Where did you get this? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, that's enough! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If our positions were reversed, I wouldn't have been in heretreating skinned elbows while you were lying passed out on your officefloor. I'd have been there a lot sooner. Perhaps in time to preventthis from ever happening! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell us again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's a duality in the man. It's hard todescribe. He's aware of his crimes. In fact, they trouble him deeply. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, that and the table. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Eighteen people lost their lives. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it. Perhapsbecause I've had the opportunity to spend more time with her and get toknow her better. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think we should. I'll see you in the morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There he is. I'm going after him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck thirty two. Clara, do you want me totalk to Isabella? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Okay, fine, if I need to. Right now, I just want to go back towork. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We are visitors. We've come to trade our cloth. May we speak? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought Data had already tried to establish communicationsthrough the universal translator. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wish I could say. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will you take me with you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why do you say that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How can you know that? Tam? You're in contact with it. With TinMan. Aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lower the force field. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really enjoyed the scene you just performed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My first appointment isn't for a few minutes. Why don't we talkfor a while? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you might like to know that in his personal logs, Dantalked about you a great deal. He loved you very much. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, if Data's physical health is unimpaired, perhaps his mentalhealth needs to be addressed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Has something happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, you're not. You're a projection, with no more substance to methan a character on the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It lasted barely a moment. She experiencedfear and confusion. And then for no apparent reason she walked out ofmy quarters. She didn't say another word, she just started walking hereand each step became more and more difficult. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is Counsellor Troi. I'll relay, sir. The pilot is busy. We've lost most of our impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. It's directed down toward the old Bandi city. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data! Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I fold. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain. I think I've found something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd book my next vacation at your hotel, if you had one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika musicin the air, ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moonrising, and the most you can say is stimulating? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jeremy, it's time for this to end. It's notreal and it's over now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You seem so strong in your support. I'm curious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is it you want from him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to put it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Several times with Captain Picard. There have been instances whenhaving an empath along has been helpful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why did you do that, Mother? You embarrassed both of us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used tosensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mistress Beata is willing to give you asecond chance. We're prepared to take your entire group with us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's up to him, and he's stopped cooperating. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think I can do anything, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hit? I'm sorry, but anything could be important. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in theGroppler's office became very uncomfortable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know how much that means to you, Data, but at the same time, bytelling her you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all yourlife. To be human. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It wasn't your fault. Please. My mother misled you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I felt pain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought Lumerians were empathic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure he'll accept such a dangerous assignment? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't need your devotion, Commander. Just your obedience. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I felt threatened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To watch him moving away from being like you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, it might be better if you stayed here this time and gaveyourself a chance to recover. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They discarded you and left. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now I know why you wore that dress. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you have a point to make, Commander? If so, it has escaped me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe because it reminds us of our own mortality. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But we've isolated the specific areas to stimulate. The feelingswere primal. Survival emotions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, maybe not everyone understands. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very close together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To intensify his memories? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I started to hear from him less and less. I knew his career wastaking him away from me but I didn't want to believe it was over. Ispent a lot of time thinking about him. Wondering where he was, what hewas doing. Sometimes I'd look into the sky and imagine that he knew,and that somehow he could sense me thinking about him. So, who knows? Maybe one night we were looking up at the same star, and you werethinking about me, and in a way, I was thinking about you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I hope you're right. I hope that's all it is. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When we reach Starbase, I'll order a complete workup, bothphysical and psychological. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Inconclusive. What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've never met a more dedicated physician. I would say she has apassion for her work. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ship's Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. Butwe'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life,and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The program's installed and waiting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you want it described here, sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well how do I know what to study if you won't tell me what I didwrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Over there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So you'd better take a hold of yourself, or be prepared for atransfer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Napeans are partially empathic. He may have inherited someof his mother's abilities. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm the ship's Counsellor and I thought you might want to talk. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sadness. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I did not intend to see him again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Vulcans possess telepathic ability. Sarek may unintentionally beprojecting intense emotions onto other people, at random. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't really think it's really a secret. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Please, don't hurt me, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander? Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually I wanted to ask your opinion about something. I've beenthinking about taking the Bridge Officer's test and becoming a fullCommander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien racecommunicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on aplanet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine. S'smarith. What did I just say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The crew's pretty shaken up. I'm arranging a memorial. I thinkyou should be the one to deliver the eulogy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? What's at Keystone City? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're doing fine. I was just about to get him his supper. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't need a scientific basis. Just be quiet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you're feeling a certain confusion about this mission. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You mean you're older, more experienced. A little more seasoned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. What happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our stun field had no effect on him. He remained conscious whilewe tried to take over the ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't be absurd, Mother. You knew what would happen. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There was a reception in Ten Forward. I introduced you to Worfand the other senior officers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You advanced quite far against such a worthy opponent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual. Wecan't be certain of that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm going for a walk in the arboretum. I wouldn't mindsome company. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I knew you would. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Go ahead, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is this what's causing our déjà vu? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, are you sure? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's in neural shock, <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences areunique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learnfrom the experience. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, he wouldn't have earned great profits from his dealingswith Starfleet. We were only interested in a new power source. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why haven't you told anyone you're an empath? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, not at all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We alarm him for some reason. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want to make you more comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We ensure the loyalty of the people. Do you believe the Empirewould be better off without our protection? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying toingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you wereyoung and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd like to help you if I can. If you'll let me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just tell me there's some chocolate here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're alive! You're all right! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've been fine, but I thought + <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, it's like a cosmic string? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't dislike you, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And we'll take our clothes half off? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's extremely anxious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everyone get down on the floor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I make a suggestion? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He can never come back, Mrs. Miller. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thanks for sticking by me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doubt. He's afraid that seeing him here and knowing what happenedto the Enterprise will make him timid, or worse, make him to hesitate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Timothy, would you like Data to stay with you a little bitlonger? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, it has gone. I no longer feel its presence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that all necessary? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our primary concern is not to assign blame, but to recover ourmissing officers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why not ask his wife if she'd like to attend? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't see how. But if I went back to the nacelle tube, I mightget a better sense of what I experienced. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If he made any personal logs, it might be helpful to look throughthem. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I began to panic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Mother <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You were always welcome. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I'll just watch you and be impressed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Indeed. I know, I was there. This is my First Officer CommanderSteven Mullen , and my Security Chief, Lieutenant Morgan Kelly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand you've had some interesting dreams recently. Geordiwas worried about you and he wanted me to check in and see how you weredoing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unnecessary, sir. These people are honest, almost to a fault. Andthey have great pride in their ways. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, not at all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir. According to the Ligon Code of Honour, Lutan has done whathe set out to do, achieve recognition for being daring and bold. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Honesty is the trait he admires most. And you should honestlyconsider why you're so competitive with your own son. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe there is. I'd like to go back and try. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's put his entire self-worth on the line with this experiment. He is telling the truth when he says he'd rather die than leave. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: By easing his pain. She's very confused byour resistance, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, you don't understand. I don't sense anything. Not out there,not in here. All of you, you're all blank to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sore? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there is a consciousness here. Not thought, more likeinstinct. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Believe it or not, that's a good sign. A beginning. Now, let's goback to the shuttlecraft. There was a Romulan ship and the first thingyou did was? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: No, I want to stay in my quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Could I? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity asbest he can. The android persona is just one step along the way. Assoon as he feels stronger and more sure of himself, it should drop awaynaturally. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I don't think it is, Data. A laugh is one step in the rightdirection. We need to help him take a few more steps. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data. Captain, I think we should ask Data to spend some time withhim. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It might. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It will fade as we move further from this planet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I want to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, there must be a record somewhere. There is a good chance wecan find it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. He was a patient <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir somefeelings. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We will each take a hostage for protection. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It may get better. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I read your report. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: J'Dan, we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of ourdilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands one week later. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is life on board, but <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sickbay to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel? Timothy, listen to me. The damage to your ship might have occurred atthe same time your arm touched the panel, but it was only acoincidence. This wasn't your fault. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know what the worst part of this is? And I've seen it happento so many patients. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Imzadi, we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why don't you ask Maques to do it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, it is. You want me, don't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A nursery rhyme? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why do you have all this anger toward me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sounds delicious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that supposed to be a question? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard is familiar with that, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One day you'll learn to be glad your father cared enough aboutyou to insist on rules. It may be hard to imagine right now, buteventually, most children come to appreciate their parents. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was useful. I felt two levels. He did know about the lifeform, but the idea of murder seemed to shock him. Whether it was thewhole idea, or just being accused of it, I can't tell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Her last ship was the Repulse. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander is scared, confused, hurt, all because his father is refusing to see him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are not fit to command. Step down. Step down or I will haveyou removed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So many minds on this ship, all free. Released, <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, I can sense feelings in you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, you will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Does this have something to do with Captain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That will bring them here in just minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard talks to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How would he react under stress? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honour to meet you, Doctor Graves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've been trying to wake you up for the last five minutes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What was this man's crime? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. Something <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you ready to cooperate? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones whohurt you. Who left you alone, rejected. The ones who make you so angry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're not my father. You're part of my mother's mind. What isthis place? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And Wesley didn't provoke you in any way? It wasn't anything hesaid, or anything he did? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, how many people on that station? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm afraid so, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Malencon. He's in trouble! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There could be thousands of lives at stake. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if you were going to mok'bara classthis morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you're so sure about that, why are you still so upset? Worf,you can't deny the possibility just because you don't want it to betrue. If you want to talk about this, you know where to find me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelingsare beside the point. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I always thought this room could use a little more colour. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? Because the others did not? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So first thing tomorrow, I thought I'd take you on a tour of theoperational centres and the residential decks of the ship. Then wecould spend some time discussing the cultural underpinnings of yoursociety. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hedril. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm absolutely lost. You have to dosomething. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can I see a police record on Roga Danar? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your cowardice does not befit a Romulan soldier. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One moment, Commander. We should hold our position until theEnterprise has left the area. We cannot risk detection. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And painful. Early diagnosis and special training did help Tamadjust, but he has some problems. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's called perfume, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels but, I can't read youright now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If any one of you defies the Tal Shiar, you will not bear thepunishment alone. Your families, all of them, will be there beside you. I am now Commander of this ship. You will take orders from me and noone else. Remove Commander Toreth from her station. If she resists,shoot her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel mainly friendship, and happiness. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Words are here on top. What's under them, their meaning, iswhat's important. Yes, that's true. We both know how to expressimportant words, like dream. Being here with you. Yes, being here withyou know is very special to me, too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, you're supposed to be avoiding telepathy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, when I was a young girl, my grandfather used to tell mestories by the fire. I would close my eyes and listen to his mind forhours on end. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, will you kindly stay out of this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I certainly wouldn't wish to throw off your entire balance. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits that areendemic to gender. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because you're the Captain, and they look up to you. You're arole model for them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: About Worf or Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not a thing. I was empathically aware of you right up to themoment you froze, and then it all stopped. The past few dayshave been exhausting. Maybe it was my imagination. There were momentsin that lecture hall when I thought time was standing still there, too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're a Commander and First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My God, Will. They're human. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He was. I don't know how he managed it. The Gemarians and theDachlyds are both incredibly stubborn people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How did he put it? As I experience certain sensory inputpatterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputseventually are anticipated and even missed when absent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, I didn't see you there. You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, let me help you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That might be acceptable to some other races, but humans areunusually attached to their offspring. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do I tell them what to do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I hear the Gandhi's going on a terraforming mission to the LaganaSector. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So it started with the war? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Geordi, I get the feeling that something special happened on thisvacation, and I'm not talking about computers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, you can't start thinking like that. You didn't abandonhim. You chose not to abandon a life-long career. It was the rightdecision, and in no way responsible for his death. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's something we eat after the main course. It's usually verysweet, it's usually very bad for you. We eat it purely for pleasure. Ifyou ask me, it's the best part of any meal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've come a long way, Reg. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We'll see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not really familiar with that protocol. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, not at all. But I believe that she's been thinking about you. Do you know why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, I'm angry. I'm angry with myself for allowing this tohappen. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! Let them go or you will all die. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It must be somewhat overwhelming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Bill. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that why Romulans were being transported to the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The mirror. I came in here. I looked into the mirror. It wasn'tme, Worf! It wasn't me! It was my face, but it wasn't me inside. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your mind must have created a defence mechanism that helped youresist the neurosomatic process. Your unconscious fastened on toelements of your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded, to keepyou sane. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you're still looking. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think he's Betazoid. It's all right. We're going to help you. Who did this? Who did this to you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I just wanted to voice my concernsabout the way the crew is responding to your unexpected orders. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He was working on bridging the gap between man and machine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, there is. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's very good. Well, that's very nice. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are you? I have to find you. I have to tell you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard will be very relieved. How did you manage it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through tohim. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor, I think Commander Data will do very nicely. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something from home? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Er, well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. Hello, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come dance at my wedding. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, are you asking my permission? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand. Bright what? Tell me more. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Chocolate is a serious thing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And I'm a pretty good student. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, you told me you had an unusualexperience when you sat down at the console. Why don't you describe it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your mother's dead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand. The idea of raising a child can seem a tremendousburden, particularly to a solitary parent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're terrified. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander Riker. It is inappropriate for you to lead the awayteam. Until the return of Captain Picard, you are in command of theEnterprise. We're in a state of war, and your place is on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Won't he realise something's happened to him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but she never lets up. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll be waiting for you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. Anddanger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's wonderful. Thank you. When is my mother arriving? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Difficult under the circumstances. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? Mother, please. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then perhaps you could spend the time exploring anotherinterests. Archeology, for instance. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The plague? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So how much do you remember? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. Now, lean back, close your eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who's Hedril, mother? Why is she here? Is Hedril me when I was alittle girl? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. I've never known you to have such strong emotions, exceptwhen you're expecting to do battle. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no anticipation, noexcitementat being rescued. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you'veever experienced. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What stage is it in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Jarada. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly hoped that meeting him like this might make an impact. Help you remember. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: For us, yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know what we can do to help him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was it a relaxing trip, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It looks like the Enterprise has been damaged. There, on the portnacelle. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I promise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, in most Betazoids our telepathic gifts develop atadolescence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm here. I'm right here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let me take you to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've got it. From all of us. We don't need any more convincing. Please, obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. Have you foundanything? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're scheming something, Mother. Don't try to foolme, I can tell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wonder if I shouldn't warn him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I could fall in love with you so easily, but we both know the endof that story, don't we? How would Martin feel about introducinghalf-Betazoid into the genetic balance? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What about your Chorus? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No help there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: For stress. Repeatedly, throughout his life. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, spare me the inspirational anecdote and just accept myresignation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, lights. Computer, turn on the lights. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mmm-hmmm. Devinoni Ral. Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm investigating Lieutenant Kwan's death, and I just wanted tolook around. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know that. Geordi, could you repair the conduit? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You made this? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, Beverly. Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Academy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which is understandable, and healthy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's coming toward us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your knowledge of us is unacceptable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I never fully appreciated how difficult and how rewarding it isto be human, but I had a lot of help. Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I join you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Romulans could've decloaked before the Enterprise had achance to respond. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everyone was talking today about the way you absorbed theCaldonian bid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you open it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can feel them all. What they want, what they feel. It's a sideof humans I've never felt before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will he be with us? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I got a little dizzy for a second. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can't you intensify that emotion? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Absolutely not. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well I suggest we beam them both back onto the ship. CommanderData is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, you might first try a relaxation technique, like plexing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And it frightens you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I really would rather be alone right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? Does the thought of my having contact with them make youuneasy? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The tension on the ship is very high. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer today's appointment calendar. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's lovely. Thank you. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, you shouldn't be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams. It's a natural expression of your unconscious, if you have anunconscious. I'm not really sure how your positronic brain works but ifit's anything like ours, then there's part of you that's trying toexpress itself through your dream state. And I think you should allowyourself to experience it. As Sigmund Freud said, dreams are the royalroad to the knowledge of the mind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To the planet? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. Have you ask my mother about this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So am I. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn'tyour intent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're our allies now, Mister Worf. We have to trust them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I won't let her have you! I'll stop her! I will go with you. Take me with you. Please, Alkar. Don't leave me. Don't do this! No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Leadership grows from self-confidence, which is also part of aStarfleet officer's education. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodbye, Daddy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And he won't give up. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's afraid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course not, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ode to Psyche. John Keats. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, some of our greatest advances have come from analysingfailure. While it can be ego-bruising <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hot chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing's going to happen to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, A single leader can make mistakes. It's far less likely inthe combined whole. Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very, very advanced, sir, or certainly very, very different. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Me too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want you to try a few relaxation techniques as well. Rememberthe ones I showed you a few months ago? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have invaded our system. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Here he is now. This is Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If I don't find him, I'm going to have to move on. Are you sureyou haven't seen him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You saved them, Will, you and the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become aCommander? I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be ChiefMedical Officer, so why put yourself through all the extra work? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness anddiversity of the two worlds. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that so? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll be sure to tell her you said so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's your mother like, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's been taken. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, would you like my advice on how to help them? Don't. Thisis something they have to work out for themselves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't mean right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. But I do know that there's a part of her that wantsto be helped. When I tried to contact her telepathically, I heard avoice calling out to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: See you later. Your first watch at Ops? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's a different feeling here than inthe tunnel. Very different. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, it was my pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want him to stop. It's not Will. Somebody's taken his place. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ronin? Your grandmother's lover? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As you know, there is very little availableon the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd like to stay here with her. I'm going to try to contact hertelepathically. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. Sometimes these things aren't over as quickly as they seemto be. I'd be happy to help if you have any further problems. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And when you saw the Romulan ship, did you try calling for help? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're not concerned with honour, Worf. This is the AncientWest. There's a gunfighter out there who has the speed and accuracy ofan android. And in two hours, he's going to try to kill you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would imagine that your self-disciplinehelps you in your work. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What stage is it in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would have thought the inhabitants of Daled Four would send afuture leader to a more hospitable environment. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd like you to talk to him about your own fascination withhumanity. If you can explain to Timothy the appeal that humanity hasfor you, he might find it easier to become a boy again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, where have you decided to go? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're not Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's nothing these people have done. I'm certain of that. Theirminds are so open. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is the truth as each of you remembers it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of theother students and parents. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you think that your feelings toward Nella could change theway you function as Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ian? Ian! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It would be very normal to be angry with her. Angry because shedied and left you alone with a son you never knew you had. Being angrydoesn't mean you loved her any less, Worf, but you can't hide from yourfeelings, just as Alexander cannot hide from his. You both have a lotof healing to do. Perhaps you should think about doing it together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's intelligent, thoughtful, typically Angosian. I know whathe's done, but when I'm with him I cannot believe he is randomly anddeliberately violent. in fact, inherently, he has a non-violentpersonality. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. Please. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I speak with you, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sorefor a week. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ensign Calloway. That doesn't sound like a man who's planning ontaking his own life. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I am only halfBetazoid. My father was a Starfleet officer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He communicated so much to me that at firstit was just a jumble of images. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, well, let me introduce you to some of my favourites. This ispeach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake. And this is myfavourite. Ktarian chocolate puff. I don't know exactly what's inside,but I think it's made with seventeen varieties of chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly, this is important. What were you thinking when you hitWes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handlingcommand. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some verydifficult decisions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I come in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If I may suggest <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So am I. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. When I was in the nacelle room I had an empathicexperience. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then it was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there ingrief and pain, the other up here, filled with anger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He seems preoccupied with recreation. I've spent more time in TenForward in the last two days than I have in the past two months. Andhe's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He has other obligations, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But not all? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Several months. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard has every right to be curious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We come from a federation of planets. Captain Picard is from aplanet called Earth, which is over two thousand light years from here. I'm from another planet called Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't you remember? You were in the sensor maintenance room. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I'm moving too fast for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did he mention anything that had happened recently, anything thatmight have upset him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Would you be suggesting a ruse of some sort? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you going to do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, we've come for Alexander. Please, forgive the intrusion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, nothing. I've gone through all her belongings, read herjournal from the last five years, and other than the fact that I'm notmarried yet, nothing bad seems to have happened to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's deceiving us, and he's clearly hoping to manipulate us. Asfor the identity of the young woman, I can't really tell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why should biology rather than technology determine whether it isa child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his ownbeing. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal hischild, then who are we to argue? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. Do it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How about you, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, she does. I'll contact Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him totransmit a copy as soon as possible. There may be some clues there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you're really over-reacting. I'm sure you're all right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have my pity. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotionalfitness of the crew. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it's trying to determine if we are a life force. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A highly structured society. and they're exceedingly proud. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain is going to take you to Ramatis. But first, he'sgiven me permission to attempt to settle the conflict down on Solais. Yes. We've come so far, and paid such a terrible price, I must try. Help me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, suddenly I'm sensing something else. Satisfaction. Enormous satisfaction. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is unfortunate that the Taguans no longer allow outsiders tovisit the ruins. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Roga, don't! You'll be killed! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no need to rush. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Whatever kind of life form Anya is, emotionally she's Salia'smother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My mother's so diligent about her journal. why would she havestopped making entries for so long? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: As a Starfleet Security Officer, she may have represented hisriskiest prize. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I felt threatened by them. Trapped <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Warbird? I was at the neuropsychology seminar at Bokara Six. Thelast thing I remember was returning to my quarters. I was attacked. Ifelt a hypospray. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Exactly what are you feeling? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Don't tempt me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you for the encouragement. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's still in shock. it's hard to know what's going on in hismind right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mmm hmm. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Looking back on the past few days, it's as though I'm looking ata holodeck projection of someone else. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. You thought it would amuse you, but it didn't. You felt nosatisfaction. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Standing by. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I'm a practicing psychologist. Maybe we can work inconcert. We are going to be together a long time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. the Captain needs our help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait. I'll try to be only half as annoying. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One of the things we monitor are your broadcast signals, yourjournalism, your music, your humour. Try to better understand you as apeople. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, it's a Betazoid method. The next time you feel nervous abouttransporting, you stimulate a neural pressure point, like this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We wish you well, Mister Ramsey. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly? We've contacted the nearest Starbase for a searchvessel. I'm afraid the closest one is almost a week away. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I don't think so. No. There's nothing. Nothing. I sensenothing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Yes, they are worried. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. Our discovery of the freighter was unexpected. Wehave a duty to investigate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are we being transformed into? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But Mistress Beata <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's being very brave. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They certainly are. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This must sound incredibly simplistic but, can't you re-engineerall this on another planet? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're not. I was just leaving. Please, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We set him free. Riker and I do notbelieve in these fables about an Overseer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's returning home from a conference on Achrady Seven, andshe's going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some timevisiting with us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But they're all much older than you are. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain is waiting for you inside. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, if you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I only asked whohe is, and where you met him. Those are not unusual questions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was you. It was always you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long were you angry with the Captain, Wes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but Ben is not. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was born on Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you would. Say thank you to Miss Gladstone for havingyou, and let's go get something to eat. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was a terrible tragedy. The worst thing that can happen to anyparent. I know you feel responsible but it was an accident. And whatyou're doing isn't fair to Kestra. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both heand Ensign T'Su are very young. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, she's back. She's trying totake Jeremy off the ship again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for him. Beverly, whenare you going to realise that you can't fool me? Who is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, please. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Brull's ready to negotiate. He just wants privacy so that hewon't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, you do have a lot to offer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop! Stop! Please, I'll do anything! Make itstop! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! No! No! Don't! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The plan has failed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor Crusher <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. You don't trust us. And I can't risk trusting you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you had to give this feeling a name, what would you call it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What of them? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am under orders. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no way to know. I'd like to try. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then all we've done is made things worse. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ambassador Loquel's quite pleasant. I will admit though, he's alittle unusual. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, I told you it's not my decision. Your father doesn't want to <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know it's not going to be easy, but I think it's important thatwe face up to what's happened. You're in command now. The crew'slooking to you for guidance. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. I'm not sure what happened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Confidence is faith in oneself. It can't easily be given byanother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, because of what he represents. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The pain is gone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, wait. We have to remember, even though the holodecksafeguards may be off, this is still aprogramme. If we can just get to the end of this story the way it wasdesigned to play out, the programme will automatically terminate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Clara, you haven't been on this she verylong, so maybe you don't know, but Ten Forward is usually forgrown-ups. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Were you hear all along? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe Isabella's gone home. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What were you going to say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, Bill was concerned that you might be upset that I caredeeply for him, too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I knew that was part of being in command and I thought I'dprepared for it, but when the moment came I hesitated. Maybe you wereright. Maybe I'm not cut out for this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I remember when he died, my mother had to go through all histhings and pack them away. I was seven. I remember thinking how madhe'd be when he came home and saw what she'd done. I didn't understandhe wasn't coming back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you feeling sad? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How to Advance Your Career throughMarriage? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So there was a trick. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're calling for help. I think they're trapped just like weare. Eyes in the dark could mean this twin star system. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why is the computer creating characters that look like Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are the risks when we leave this room? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't believe this, Will. None of it's real. You're still with uson the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you always say you like surprises, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. And. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's no reason to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: For the sole purpose of making Lieutenant La Forge theirprisoner. Captain's personal log, stardate 42779.5. We havearrived at Starbase Five One Five. I'm still quite uneasy, despiteassurances that this medical procedure poses little risk. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Geordi, are you in pain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How simple all this would be without the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long will the field last? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wouldn't know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then you know I am correct. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But why is this happening? What does the archive hope toaccomplish? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come here. He's been injured, and he's embarrassed. And to have anyone see him now would make him feel worse, even if it were you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And your Klingon side? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hot chocolate. Computer, I need myappointment schedule for next week. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who is he? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's right. A child might represent vulnerability. Hedril maydepict some fragile part of my mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Without hesitation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But the only emotions Data seems to feel are negative. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You want him. I can tell. But you have nothing to give him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ensign. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's as if I were to say to you, Juliet on her balcony. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is someone alive, but he didn't kill these people. Here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But that's what's so odd. It wasn't tense at all. In fact, Isensed no tension from you or Goss. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm no longer Imzadi to you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll watch him for you, Sheriff. You two go have a good time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, if Jeremiah is returned to his family in his presentcondition, it would be a wrenching experience for everyone. Especiallyfor him. He needs to re-discover his identity, make some connectionwith his roots. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Muzzle it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. Itcould be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He has been under a great deal of strain lately. While we were onGemaris, he ate sparingly and slept even less. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean by that? I'm doing the best that I can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to La Forge. Get us out of here now! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not talking about the base. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That would make my mother your step-mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, do that. But hurry! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you feeling sad? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A regrettable incident, Captain. The freighterwas fired upon by the former Commander of this vessel. I have now takencontrol, and I assure you there will be no more attacks. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure you did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're light years away. That's impossible, even for you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What were the voices saying? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's across the square from the Zanza Men's Dance Palace. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Clara, your father tells me Isabella has been saying some verybad things to you. What did she say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I cannot reveal that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All you need to know for now is that we want to rest. Simply,finally, to rest. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And obviously you do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is something wrong, sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Congratulations, Data. It's a girl. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It pulses unendingly all through the night. Seek outthe crystal that powers our flight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's so loud! It's getting louder! Please, I can't stand it. Makeit stop! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Change the ship's orbit to an inclination ofeighty degrees south. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why too late? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, if it's a distress call, I think they'd be asking for whatthey need, not what they already have. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It would also help if they knew what was going on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Somehow I doubt the Yridians are going to be forthcoming aboutwhere they might have gone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, what's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, let's assumefor a second you're right, that things did happen as you remember them. Are you saying that everyone's memory on this ship has been altered butyours? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored yourdistress call but then you never acknowledged our response. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, we do not want to exaggerate thisincident. You and I can discuss it calmly. We can diffuse it before itbecomes inflated. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm just not ready to give up my life here. Not yet. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's not? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If only I could go back to the control room without beingoverwhelmed by the experience. It might help me remember some detailthat might be relevant. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Data. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. I just saw them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And courage from wisdom. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is Counsellor Deanna Troi from the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know. almost everyone has a moment in their lives when theyexceed their own limits, achieve what seems to be impossible. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm curious. Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've alreadyexperienced? Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, well, actually, I was waiting until we got to the desserts. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that what you see here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I get a sense of ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearlydivided, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that what you've decided to do? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Doctor, why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact thatthe exocomp could be alive? After all, you're talking to a livingmachine right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You mean you've never had telepathy with someone who wasn'tCairn? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, they couldn't explain it any more than you could. You know,at this point I'm not willing to say it's coincidence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Look at him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But he doesn't have an edge. Your edge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then I won't use telepathy. We'll work verbally. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Riva, go slowly. Slowly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her empathy. Youmust be Commander Riker's father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't like good-byes. How about, until next time? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Especially when you haven't done so in a while. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who's going to come and kill everyone? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure we can. It would mean abandoning their fundamentalway of life. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Vulcan? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come by my quarters and I'll show it to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, you must be the first person who's come into my office andbeen excited at the prospect of a new neurosis. But yes, I do thinkit's possible, and I'd like to start counselling you on a regularbasis. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was certain it would never happen, Captain. The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me awayfrom home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoidtradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Incredible. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Fine with me, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd appreciate some suggestions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do you feel? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, you know what they say, Mister Worf. Hell hath no fury likea woman scorned. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> TROI: Our presence in the Neutral Zone is provocative. It could forceher to respond. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He committed no crime. He says he was ordered there with otherslike him. When the first soldiers returned toAngosia, they had trouble. The rules changed too quickly. A lost tempercould result in murder. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mmm? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, this is a much better way of communicating for you. It's far less confusing than the way you normally speak. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's Ambassador Odan. I continually feel fluctuations of emotionfrom him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth. Colourless. Hollow. Nothing seems real. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data. You can handle defeat in two ways. You can lose confidence,or you can learn from your mistakes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: M'ret? He's one of the highest ranking members of the Romulangovernment. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Have you made preparations to separate the Saucer section? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, may I have a word with you in private? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not according to my mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're coming. They're coming with the storm. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's she doing here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was so awful to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Beverly and I have been getting unusual reports. Peoplebehaving strangely, others hearing sounds that aren't there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies onLigon. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Happy birthday, Worf. Will wanted to give you a surprise party,but I knew you'd hate it so I talked him out of it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And youshouldn't worry about making it look perfect. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His own government. He's been programmed to be the perfectsoldier. He can be absolutely normal, but whena danger is perceived, the programming clicks in and takes over. Memory, strength, intelligence, reflexes, all becomeenhanced. He's conditioned to survive at any cost. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all right, no one's going to hurt you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now wait a minute. I don't understand <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How can you be so sure? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Except me. And all I have is nightmares. I can hardly sleep atall anymore. In the end, I'll be like him. Just like him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All right, you were lying on the table. You had a bright lightshining in your eyes. Were there any smells in the room? Were there anysounds? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This might sound crazy, but for a moment I thought I was stuck inthat wall. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's just a feeling that he's, well, that he's closed part of hismind to me. I just feel that the Captain has become, perhaps dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's somethingin there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't. Don't. I won't let you! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, the Federation was founded in Twenty One Sixty One, so,twos, sixes, and aces are wild. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A little shaken but all right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then do it. That's an order. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: sleep occurs at a different frequency forBetazoids than other humanoids. I believe the beings are using thatfrequency to communicate telepathically. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This was delivered for you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old. He's aboard the Enterprise, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Imzadi, do you still care about me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mister Ramsey and the other survivors refuse to leave. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My mother bought our freedom, Captain. She doesn't want to staywith Tog. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Timothy's a boy feeling a great deal of pain. But he is a boyagain. Is this difficult for you, Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Clara, please tell me what Isabella said. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I return later? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Geordi, there should be a power utilisationmonitor over there. Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, I find it strange that none of our visitors feels muchremorse about the two freighter passengers who perished. Yet thatbarrel of cargo is a source of great anxiety to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We still have to learn how to live in the real world, Mother. Allof us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's almost exactly what you said. As though therewas something else inside you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ambassador, it's an honour to meet you. Would you like to seeyour quarters before we attend the reception? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Their individual intelligence and their behavioural responses areexactly the same as they were before the accident. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You can see her? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Conor and I have had a relationship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know, but something terrible happened in there. I feltit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, how does it feel being with people again? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one ofmy father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turnedup. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You always say that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's reading normal now. How did you manage that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hey, hey, slow down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother. Will, we have to help her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Even now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Amanda's a Q? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We do, sir. We do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Interesting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you describe where you were, what it looked like? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We are giving you the exact coordinates of our remains on boardthe wreck of the Essex. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my motheris a Betazoid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your plan has failed. This ship must be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there's been a great deal of damage to our computersystem. Maybe we're not getting the correct information. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Glad I could help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But our presence must not interfere with the cultural developmentof the Mintakans. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is a presence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, we're out of the cell andwe're trying to contact the Enterprise, but we can't do it withoutTog's access code. Do you think you could manage to <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How are you feeling? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Some of it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are we going now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What did happen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you were just going to talk to him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. When do you leave? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be inascendance at any given time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Even for your wife? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Look at what we have so far. Evidence that these aliens have beentravelling back in time to Earth. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If only half of us live, then I'd rather take my chances on beingone that does. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir. Enterprise, three to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ritual provides a structure in society, good rituals and badrituals alike. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Remove her weapon. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What about nightmares? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I feel the same about being here. I'm something of a student ofhuman nature, and I find this all fascinating. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wait! I want to talk to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that all, Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't believe you, Mother. You sound like you're sizing up acommodity. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's different. That's a matter of protection. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Captain, it's just a rare pleasure to meet this sideof your personality. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can't do that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's like it belongs to someone else. Nothing feels right. Thisroom, this ship, most of all this war we're fighting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. Four, maybe five seconds. You just stopped and thenstarted again. I can't explain it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's used to us, and we're used to him. It's like finding outsomeone you love has a terminal illness and <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So what did I do wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memoryas to what happened. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's telling the truth. Acting Captain's log, stardate 47135.2. DoctorCrusher has positively identified Captain Picard's DNA. There's nodoubt now that he's dead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why, is he coming along? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My skin, it's tingling. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our Chief Security Officer is Klingon. That has nothing to dowith it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your grandmother had remarkable green eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm the ship's Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I'd ordersomeone to their death. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I did. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then ask me one I can answer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Give me an example of what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I met with him about six weeks ago, during the crew evaluations. He was very positive. He was looking forward to being posted to thenacelle tube. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know if this means anything, but I seem to have anability that the others don't. I have a very strong sense of what otherpeople are feeling at times it's almost <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It seems to have an especially strong hatred of you, Captain, orto a lesser degree, any authority figure. And worst part is, it'sgrowing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that better, sweetheart? Everything's going to be fine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's been a long day. Why don't you get ready for bed and we'll talk about this again in the morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians, for that matter? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Nara, may I ask you something? The work LieutenantKwan was doing, was it unusual in any way? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I agree, but she does have the right to make that choice, even ifwe don't feel it's a good one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If wetry to avoid that pain, we can make it harder on ourselves in the longrun. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is precarious. The stress of exposure to so many minds on theship is bad enough. Now he's strongly drawn to this creature. I'mafraid for him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Surely you must have some means of communication in case of aplanetary emergency. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, go on. It'll be all right. I'll take care of your father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, we're among non-telepaths. It's impolite not to speakaloud. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Terraformers are often obsessive. It frequently goes with thecareer profile. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have been given broad discretionary powers. Subcommander N'Vekacted under my authority, the authority of the Tal Shiar. I assure youthis action will not be questioned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Captain has given unusual orders before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If we can just reach Jono, help him make some connections withhis origins, he may choose to come with us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You only ask to torment me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it was fairly clear during your last appointment. It wasobviously non productive. I couldn't sense what you were feeling. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He desperately wants to leave this ship. Captain's log, supplemental. We continue on courseto Endicor. We are now less than two hours away from our rendezvouswith ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm afraid I don't see how a stolen Vulcan ship fits into allthis. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're terrified of me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Data, but there is no malevolence or ill will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, I doubt that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is late. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Pain. Such pain! Pain! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensurenon-interference. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now something has changed that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Would you like to talk about what's bothering you or would youlike to break some more furniture? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My father used to read me stories from the Ancient West when Iwas a little girl. I must admit, I always wanted to play the part ofthe mysterious stranger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Fine. It was good to see some old friends. I'd lost touch withmost of them. It's interesting to see the different paths some of theirlives have taken. Beverly, you don't usually stand a watch on theBridge even when Data's not here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, discontinue. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you feel up to it? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You mean he never knew he hadn't left the holodeck? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, perhaps if we understood your thinking, if you couldexplain <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I like her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's an understatement. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm going to head back to the ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a veryintense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden butshe didn't want to talk about it, so I let her alone. I sensed that shewas holding something back, that she wasn't telling me the whole truth. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The ophidian the aliens were carrying. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What about your travelling companion? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Pure observation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because hership is as crippled as the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: you were on thought you were on Chandra Five. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very much so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you have another dream last night? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unhappiness. Terrible despair. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you are the only person with whom he has shown anyconnection. If he is to find his humanity then you are the only one whocan help him. It's up to you, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mintakan emotions are quite interesting. Like the Vulcans, theyhave highly ordered minds. A very sensible people. For example,Mintakan women precede their mates. It's a signal to other women. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain? Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't believe it was an accident. I think Lieutenant Piercefound out the other two were having an affair. He lost control and hekilled them both. Afterwards, he probably activated the plasma streamand then threw himself into it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's time to go, sweetheart. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What thoughts? Take your time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We should talk about this later. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He didn't show up for his appointment. I assumed he must still behere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Those stairs are where we entered down here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have the results of the tests. I ran them several times to besure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A few hours ago, while the away team was on the surface. I wastrying to, I was thinking of Rishon and Kevin. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You almost always feel a sense of loss, but it is possible tocarry something of that experience through the rest of your life inways that you aren't even aware of now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your method of communication is most elegant and quite beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain! Beam them up quickly! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There must be some way we can track it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Monroe! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I sensed that allwere not concerned for the same reason. Undoubtedly there are survivorsfrom the Odin on this planet. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you saying that you caused them to become individuals? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. Something is terribly wrong with Lal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't want to frighten you. She has opted for the onlydignified option open to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Step back, now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Let's do something with Isabella another day. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Weren't you getting along? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's lovely I can understand why you are reluctant to leave,Mister Conor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're feeling profoundly sad. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I believe there are still people alive down there and I'm goingto give them every chance. Assuming they're alive, they'll be hopingthere's someone up here who can help them. So we'll help them. Chief,divert the necessary power to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop search. Computer, how many entries are there for Darmok? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The board shows green, Captain. All go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is your plan? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I could ask you the same question. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do what you feel is necessary. In the meantime, we must protectourselves. Engage the cloaking device. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've got some things to take care of. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Three months ago. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. I'll let them know you're coming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: While they are learning how to communicate with Riva, they'll belearning how to communicate with each other. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I would say the people that know you and have worked with you,will be able to make the adjustment eventually. But there are somepeople who would find it difficult to accept a twelve year old captain. JR <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Enjoy your trip, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know what could have happened to it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You must understand, the Captain is a very + <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Something like that. Oh, Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Coward. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you have to? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: May I join you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Seldom have I heard an explanation so well-rehearsed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't like goodbyes. How about, until next time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. He was very mysterious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If Barclay is having difficulty facing reality, to suddenlydestroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could doconsiderable damage. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All the King's horses and all the King's Men, couldn'tput Humpty together again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not at all. It happened several years ago and it's well behindboth of us now. I just thought you should know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's alive. In stasis. Who is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You couldn't wait? The Captain would have done it for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: An entire planet has been terrorised because of the suggestionthat you're going to enslave the population. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now just wait here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That terrifies you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will not be treated that way! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd read two chapters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have to. You can't hold it back. It's killing you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I believe some will choose to risk deathrather than leave, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, load Bridge Officer's test,Engineering qualification section one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Wounded? Isolated? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wish I could. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's just, how well do you really know him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Several thousand? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: With all due respect, Captain, you don't know what you're talkingabout. That is a common belief with no scientific basis, no doubtcreated by normal people who felt uncomfortable around the disabled. Iam disabled, and I'm telling you I cannot perform my duties. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She has decided to focus all of her sexual energy on one male,who will, of course, eventually become her husband. It seems, Captain,that you are the early favourite. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? What do you feel? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm glad you weren't that hard on Ensign Lopez. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: With your permission, sir. D <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've served together for a long time and I think I've come toknow you pretty well. I have to believe if you ever reach your goal ofbecoming human, you won't become a bad one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you aren't up to it then you don't deserve to be here. Isn'tthat right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you be more specific about the table? You mentioned it wassmooth and cold. Can you remember what shape it was? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain Picard Day is one of the children's favourite schoolactivities. They look forward to it all year. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He tried to escape. The force field sent him into neural shock. If he dies, Lore will blame you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The same. He's withdrawn. He's very frightened. All of his lifehe's been in control, and now for the first time he doesn't have anyanswers. The doctor gave him a complete medical examination. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not that simple, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Transfer the letters from my mother to the viewscreen. And,computer, I would like a real chocolate sundae. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You just did the KoH-man-ara. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will must've done something to their weapons. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm so sorry, Aaron. I wish I could do something to help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And a lot of impudence. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I panicked. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They were just exiled to Lunar Five. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then we've found a way to repel the infection. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Isn't Barkon Four inhabited? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. Mister Mandel, I'd like you to assist Ensign Ro. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A little. You were right, though. There is something to belearned when you're not in control of every situation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where's the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were seeingsomeone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I feel such an abundance of well being on the ship. It feelslike, quite wonderful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe we can go around them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are a most unusual species. Worthy of a second chance. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm all right. Medical team to the Bridge. Troi to Sickbay. Counsellor Troi to Captain Picard. Troi to Engineering. Counsellor Troito any crew member, please acknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then Ian was right. He was the cause. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd love to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Similar. It's only at mid-life that a Betazed female becomes,well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When was the last attempt made? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't try and stop me! No, no, let go! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why are you here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yridian tea. I've been thinking about what happened to me in thenacelle tube. Whether it was an empathic echo left by Kwan's death. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you recall if anything unusual happened there? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Commander, but I believe Mister Barclay and I had adate scheduled, for a walk in the Arboretum? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's frozen. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But it was a thrill. Lutan is such, such a basic male image andhaving him say he wants you <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To be honest, he's testing even my limits. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His nonchalance is studied and practised. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't believe I'm hearing this from the Heir to the Holy Ringsof Betazed, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Strength comes from love. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's talk to them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not your style? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that how you felt when he left to live with your parents? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My God. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hang on, Will. Hang on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps to prepare them for times like these. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because of the nightmares? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! Captain's log, stardate 45430.9. Counsellor Troihas fallen into a deep coma. After a thorough examination, DoctorCrusher has been unable to find signs of illness or infection. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. Come in for a drink? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He does, when he thinks it's necessary. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You've never been a parent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Health and safety inspections? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure they understand. As soon as you feel up to it, you canprobably still join them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Bonding. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Pain. Pain. Loneliness. Terrible loneliness. Despair. I'm notsensing the Groppler, sir, or any of his people, but it'ssomething very close to us here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you think there's enough evidence to prove his innocence? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't say that. I just want you to be aware that this isunlike any other more casual relationship that you've attempted. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How? How can I help you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: True, you're well respected in your field. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Leave her alone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think it's time you told me what this is all about. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was havingsome kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolicallyit probably does have some kind of logic to it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you for coming with me, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It is our way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To break their spirit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander, if Mister Conor doesn't mind, I'd like to stay and seemore of his colony. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have no idea. I've never seen it before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But he's not responding. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's the year they were married. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not crazy about it. You are being taken apart molecule bymolecule. Reg, you're not the first person to have anxiety abouttransporting. We can desensitise you to this type of fear. It's a slowand gradual process, but it works. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure it is safe, otherwise it would not have been loaded. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Or the emotions that they produce. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How so? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's having an unusually traumatic effect on everyone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why do you say that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just bear with me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We still can. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. No, I'm alone. There's no one there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is it you're looking for? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, sometimes a cake is just a cake. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> TROI: I believe your impression of Data is probably unique. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you tried to keep that knowledge from us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your answer would be meaningless. That act had no reason. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You cried when father died. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Kestra? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is anything wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think so. During his telepathic contact with my mother, Maquessensed what he calls a dark place. He tried to tell me about it before,in my office, and I misunderstood. I thought he was talking aboutthoughts my mother was keeping private, but what he meant was thatthere was something happening in her met conscious mind. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, what's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your last valet tried so hard to rid me of it. Whatever happenedto Mister Xelo? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just a few seconds. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: To be honest, I was bored. I spent most of my time at ProfessorWagner's phylobiology seminar. I thought the idea of the seminar wasthat we would all participate, bring different points of views to thediscussion. He gathered two hundred scientists from all over theFederation, and all he did was put us to sleep. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It felt as if it were something from your past. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. But I do keep reminding myself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did she say why? I know you're very frightened. Sometimes what weimagine can be just as scary as something real. But I promise you,there is no way Isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago, and a lot ofother things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's the perfect opportunity. The Enterprise is nearby. If we cancommunicate with them, they might be able to help us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He believes what he's saying. His anger is genuine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, this is an insect mind, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you feel different now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You were really surprised they came back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A single word can lead to tragedy. One word misspoken ormisunderstood. And that could happen here, Data, if we fail. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This man was complaining about a strange doctor and nurse whovisited that patient. Perhaps they're still in the hospital. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh, I can't read Ullians, but I do know a certain Betazoid motherwho is a great deal like your father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It seems you have an advocate, Q. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Nearly fifteen hundred now, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're still here! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's get to the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, all I'm sensing from you is anger and hatred. Have you feltany other emotions? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What the future holds no one canknow, But forward we look and forward we go. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps. But it's a place to start. After all, he is family. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Amanda, how are you feeling about all this now? It must beoverwhelming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure they are. Data, you obviously don't have a trouble withrealism, but you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you shouldtry something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a newpiece. I'd like you to sculpt music. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The temporary presence of these humans should not interfere withyour plans. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, show me a rectangular conference table. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you deal me in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Admiral Uttan Narsu, Starbase Twelve. You will find all this inStarfleet records. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. He's my friend. That means you are, too. I promise I won'thurt you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What happened to Amanda's parents? Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was the day before you started your tour on the Potemkin. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm alone in my quarters. I'm remembering something from a fewyears ago. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander, I need to come too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there's a presence on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain? Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm only worried about your state of mind, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In time, and with help. Wesley Crusher does. He does. And so willJeremy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That might be a good idea. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In true Klingon fashion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know what I have to do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, it's freezing in here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's the game? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, Maques, what do you think of the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can you tell us what it is? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why were you put in prison? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've seen another one, like Palmer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I didn't know you played chess. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can't track down any element that might be responsible. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was as though my own consciousness were pushed to the side. Iwas watchingeverything happen, hearing my own voice, but not being able to controlany of it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And false humility. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very close. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've grown so accustomed to it, I forget it's there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're your friends. We allknow the stress you've been under. I'm sure everyone understandsperfectly. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought you'd already decided on a chronological structure. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then there has been some memory loss. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, they are. This entire situation is a little unnerving. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Troi to Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mrs. Carmichael, thank goodness you're here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think I have. The man who looked familiar to me may have servedon board the Enterprise in the last seven years, so I've asked thecomputer to limit its search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitiaand on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Children are our offspring. They're our young. They grow intoadults over a period of many years. They grow into beings like us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Some do. Others are confused. It takes some time for a new crewto get to know their Captain, and for him to know them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all deception. Nothing the Pakleds havesaid or done has been sincere. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Most people find a counsellor intimidating at first. It's okay ifyou feel that way toward me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Like a message in a bottle. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're running out of time. Farek's about to begin the neural scanon Mother. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is that what you believe? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's difficult to explain. I feel there's something differentabout these two people. I'm sorry. I can't be clearer than that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are scared, aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. No, really, I'm all right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He can't, Mother. He has his orders. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. There is no life here. What I have sensed is more like animprint. An echo of the last moment of life. Human life. They all diedin terror  RIKER <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. I believe something invaded them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Barclay, I've been calling you,why haven't you responded? Reg, what are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But did we tell them anything they wanted to hear? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So you like horses for the romance? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hasn't that been the problem all along? Throughout your careeryou've had lofty goals, but you've never been willing to do what'snecessary to attain them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Because it's the right thing to do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Relax. You've written a brilliant speech. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You must have known I couldn't allow you to do that <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm a little concerned at the turn this istaking. It seems Clara is beginning to do inappropriate things andblaming them on Isabella. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takesan enormous commitment. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Like a caress? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is asupervisory position, I'd go with her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're not dealing with an individual mind. They don't have asingle leader. It's the collective minds of all of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They need you on the Bridge, now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just know you're not serious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, if you'll excuse me, I have the Bridge this watch. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh? Why is that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're coming with me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If I may suggest, sir, no apology. In their view, it would weakenus. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The sun chasing an animal? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Voices? What do they say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All your friends on board do. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You didn't think it would be your last chance to see her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You should take it with you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was in a dark place. Cold. Frightened. Someone was there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's something that occurs to Betazoid females as they entermid-life. We call it the phase. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not true. He does know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's good you don't feel set back. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist. It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. Forexample, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take apositive action to correct it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. It's more like remembering an emotion. Feelingsthat you're somehow associated with. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Medical team to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: One seven three. Daedalus-class starship. Crew, two hundredand twenty nine. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you have any idea why Hedril would make my mother sad? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You barbarian! This woman <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, remember who you're talking to. You are bothered, I cantell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The finalists will be here in half an hour. You have to pick afirst, second and third place, and four honourable mentions. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, but you're not convinced. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Three dead, four wounded. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: A little. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do I know I won't be killed anyway? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. I'll tell the Captain. Well, I have to go. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, it's quite inappropriate to ask thecaptain to <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf. I was just talking with Mrs. Kyle theprimary school teacher. She told me you enrolled Alexander in her classthis morning. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've never seen the woman before, or the man who was with her. But there was someone else there. A man. He was staring at me in themost peculiar way. I think he had reddish hair. And he did seemfamiliar to me. But it's all so hazy. It's like trying to remember adream. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually I, we have plans. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you know Admiral Brand? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ian, I think the Captain wants to know if you are ready to tellus why you came here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We were brought to this moon over five centuries ago from a starsystem called Ux-Mal. We were separated from our bodies and left todrift in the storms. Once we almost escaped, on board the Essex, butthat ship was incapable of eluding this moon's electromagnetic storms. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind, Captain. I wouldfeel that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, but it's certainly unusual behaviour for Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why not? You've eliminated all the technical explanations. And itmakes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex, more human,that you might experience the same kind of psychological complexitiesas a human. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You look very handsome, if I might saying so Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's always hard to lose someone you care about, but to lose themlike this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They won't give you what you want. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our captain needs a vacation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We will take them with us and see that they were reunited withtheir families. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's a general feeling of disorientation on board, but nothingserious as far as I can tell. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do we communicate? I know you can read lips, but I need yourwords. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our sensors do show some passages, sir. Perhaps you and I? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's it like being an android? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When exactly did you feel this other emotion? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Some sexual attraction from all the males. Lieutenant Yar isphysically very attractive. But with Lutan I felt something else. Something more like avarice or ambition. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, don't worry about it. Geordi explained everything to me. Itwasn't your fault. But somehow I thought turnabout would be fair play,so I made us a little something to snack on. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you're reading their emotional states, their inner selves,and then using that to manipulate them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I may be perfectly fine by tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We'll never get through the gravitic sensor nets. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Tal Shiar has obtained access codes for the sensor nets. Iwill provide them if necessary. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Such overwhelming intensity of emotion. Whenwe first encountered them, it must have been more than my senses couldprocess. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Right now, there isn't much he can understand. He's holding allhis feelings inside. Children often feel they must be true to thememory of a lost parent. If you offer affection to them too soon theycan feel guilty returning that affection. As if they're betraying thelove of the parent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've both had relationships with other people. This isdifferent. I didn't know how you'd feel about it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're quite right, Picard, it's not rest we seek. Only escape. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That is not a problem. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hedril, be careful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Give everyone something to do, somewhere to focus theirattention. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Who's this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't. If you should be hurt <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I get some hot chocolate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is there any evidence at all that they're sentient? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakansare proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful andhighly rational. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. One second I was talking to you, and the next you were allstanding around me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Geordi, could you repair the conduit if you went into thecrawlspace? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, if Tam breaks down over there, we'll be no closer toaccomplishing our mission. It would be a grave mistake. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am Troi and this is Riker. You've had a very interesting dream. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's great hostility behind his smile. He'll stop at nothingto complete his mission. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Really, you don't have to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Isabella would you like some too? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't? No emotion at all? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It would destroy them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He was intelligent, actually. Thoughtful, in a ruthless sort ofway. Cold. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In another time and place this could be funny. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you bothered by his being here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come on, it'll be all right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You are aware of our existence. Our attempt to place you inbiochemical stasis has failed. We have no choice but to destroy thisship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Those are very strong emotions, and you're right, very littlegood can come from them. But I don't think that an exploration of angerneed necessarily lead to hatred or malice. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello. Pleased to meet you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but I don'tunderstand Starfleet's urgency. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from a damagedFederation freighter may be marooned on your planet. We are seeking tolearn if this is so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mine. And if you do not wish to undergo another personalexperience with the Tal Shiar, I suggest you not question me again. Now, proceed on course bearing one oh two mark four to the Kalebsector. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know what you're asking, but I feel nothing from it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He was being controlled by a mind altering machine, Commander. Without his knowledge. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know what to say. It's a great honour. So, that wouldmake me your? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You dreamt you were in bed with someone? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It could be. We know so very little about them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There is limited information, but I will prepare something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, humans sometimes find it helpful to have an outsider setthe standard by which they're judged. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How could that happen? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your saddle? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm glad you think so. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's possessed of highly abstracted reality. Lovely visions,little data. You might do better than I. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Interesting. You'll be the only one on board the Enterprise, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What kind of woman do you find attractive? Do you find meattractive? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where you will complete the negotiations and sign the treaty. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They need a distraction. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir, I think Tasha's been infected too. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: On the holodeck we've made that legend come true. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's an excellent chance my mother may be joining us onStarbase twelve. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality. Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is unquestionablytelepathic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you coming? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I need you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure I looked terrible with my eyes all red and swollen fromcrying. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, Hedril. So do I. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We might be able to run time back to a point before the warp corebreach occurred and then find a way to prevent the power transfer. Andthen when time goes forward <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Don't say that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not our help they want. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Oh no, I want to know about you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've been working with Ensign Brooks sincethe death of her husband. She'savoided the reality of what happened, denied it to herself, and Irealise I've been doing the same thing about my condition. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Interesting. Have a good trip, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Respect is earned, not bestowed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered. Welive in a peaceful Federation with most of them. The people you see arehere by choice. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think Orton's in a talking mood, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him. I should warn you, sir. My mother is a little eccentric. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have no idea. No idea what this is like. How can you knowwhat it's like to lose something you never had? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There was much fear in that room. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm on my way. Let me know if you find anything. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've learned you are a soldier. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I do not believe that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Established parameters? You sound like Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I think there's been a slight miscommunication. Did youwant to meet with Gul Lemec in here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His fear is escalating. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will! Captain, we're all concerned about <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you. You're envious of him. You pretend to support him, butsecretly you want him to fail. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everyone was looking directly at me, but it was as though I wasseeing through someone else's eyes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know, but it's intense. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's nice. Data, this isamazing. How did you come up with this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why are you so hard on yourself? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I heard what happened on the Bridge. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sensed nothing unusual last night. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I won't trick you or lie to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, lower the surrounding light level. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand, but let go of it. You're here now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe we can discuss that possibility. But first, I have to findhim, collect the money I'm owed. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, no! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense that the alien is somehow calling him. If we allow him todo as he insists, to beam over, I'm believe that we will lose him toit. That he will lose himself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And his father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jealousy. Intense, burning jealousy. A human emotion, and it wascoming from Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's more here than you're telling us. You're forcing yourselfto hold back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I was just leaving the reception when this Ktarian walks up to meand says, hello, Diane. I understand you're an empath. I'm a very sensitive man myself. I'm doing a thesis on interspeciesmating rituals. Would you care to join me in some empirical research? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough toput my mind off most frustrations. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you've never met your father before. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I did not ruin anything. We've became very good friends. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? Thefact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least sometelepathic ability. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Just for a moment, you seemed familiar. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That was a beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Angry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't explain it, Captain. They're elusive. They're, I'm sorry <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good question. Worf? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's hiding something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Kaleb sector? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think you should be careful. This isn'tjust some experiment you're running, Data. Jenna is a living, breathingperson with needs and feelings that have to be considered. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course I remember. We both cried. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Worf, I hung that painting there. At your birthday party,remember? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, please, don't do this to me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you talking to me from Sickbay? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's overwhelming to have so much of your life missing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You have pointed out yourself we are all at risk every day ofevery mission. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I've temporarily lost my empathic sense. It's kind of like havingone hand tied behind your back. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ian said he's the reason the ship is in danger. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wanted so much to help him, to be there for him, but the more Iwas. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where did he go? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll say. Devinoni Ral. It's ridiculous, and wonderful. I feelcompletely out of control. Happy. Terrified. But there's nothingrational about this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Flush. Queen high. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, will you help me get to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: At least this man has genuine experience in diplomacy. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations, and whenthey're done I'm going to reward myself with two ice cream sundaes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Using the technology of the Enterprise, we might be able to findthese men. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very attractive. There's no problem with socialisation here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humansare now their allies? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps we're looking in the wrong place. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Lal. How are you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, this is Counsellor Troi. Request access. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Except for some reason that no one understands, occasionallya Betazoid child is born different. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If we have established that the Romulans were not responsible forthe destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent to withdraw? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I get a great deal of satisfaction out of my work. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can see her point. Sugar with your tea? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy. She must havebrought a great deal of joy to your lives. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just listen to the sound of my voice. Take a slow deep breath inthrough your nose and let it out through your mouth just as slowly. That's better, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, remember what we talked about? Your father wants to do this by himself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Is he there alone? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's all right. They're home. We were wrong. The cosmic string itwas never dangerous to them. It was the one place in the galaxy theymost wanted to be. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I just don't understand how she fits in to all this. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Passionate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to theholodeck. I could interact with the characters and maybe find someclues to help us understand what's happening. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're the Captain, sir. You're entitled. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good work, Mother. According to Mother, DaiMonTog is extremely relaxed at the moment. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's dreaming. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What deck is this? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. He was able to access images being generated by hermetaconscious, but he couldn't make any sense of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose. It's an old earthpoem by John Milton. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're excused. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's all right. He's only stunned. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: She's not a ghost. She's here right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You must save him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Reg. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not saying we should accept her claim at face value, but Isensed no deception from her. She really believes she is the daughterof Tasha Yar. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have been forced to take this action, Captain, because we needyour help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Go ahead, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We will be cloaked. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Imzadi, we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I advise you, Picard, not to pass our way again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's true. He still cares for you, despite the physical changeshe's undergoing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodnight, Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Bill, more than anything else in the world, anything, you want tobe a starship captain. True? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Riva. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where's Vash? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you saying? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, if he's seeing someone else he should tell Alyssa. I mean,it might hurt her now, but it would be better in the long run. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I hope I'm not interrupting. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I sense how upset you are. You're angry and impatient. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe communication through dreams can work both ways. I couldtry to get them to stop. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out ofour bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style,as only you can make it, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know the Mariposan culture seems alien, even frightening, butreally, we do have much in common. They're human beings fighting forsurvival. Would we do any less? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Riva is going to teach them sign language. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was it something about the console itself? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if theCaptain led this away party. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not precisely. More like, if you want his services, I'm the oneyou have to negotiate with. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts lastnight. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sorry. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Real. Not one of your perfectly synthesised, ingeniously enhancedimitations. I would like real chocolate ice cream, real whipped cream <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I, too, would never say goodbye, Imzadi. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. Thetruth might be devastating to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When would you leave? 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The ship was protecting itself again. Stopping us frominterfering. Whatever it's doing it intends to continue. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He said, thank you. I told him we will miss him. And I will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And from these specifics, what general conclusion can youextrapolate? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are these dark spots? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Proceed. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Very glad to be here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It could provide us with valuable information about what'stroubling him. You know, there's nothing wrong with a healthy fantasylife, as long as you don't let it take over. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But I feel perfectly fine otherwise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, I've asked Beverly if we might get Wesley to talk to Jeremyabout his father's death. The one unusual element is Worf. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We can't delay much longer. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think I know what she's doing. You have to fight to get herback, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time, and notbefore. Is that clear, Ensign? RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All I care about at this moment is a little boy who's terrified he's going to lose his father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where are you? Captain's log, stardate 44635.8. Four days havepassed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of theBrittain. I have decided we should return to Starbase two twenty, andto that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brittain for towing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How long has it been since your last diplomatic contact? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I hada sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous abouther. To celebrate her life, not mourn it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The cells are metabolising at an incredible speed. Almost fiftytimes normal. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jono, what is it? Jono! I just suggested he take off his gloves. Suddenly he lost control. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Which confirms the feeling of duality that Isensed earlier in both of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? What's going on? What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have no reason to believe she's been hurtin any way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, you're not just incorrigible, you're insatiable. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So what? You've acted in the best interest of your ship and crew. What more could you ask of yourself? If it turns out to be a mistake,then we'll be a little late arriving at Durenia Four. That's all. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But I'll honour them, of course. I'm a Betazoid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure he'll do very well. She's a wonderful teacher. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but that doesn't meanyou can't make a future for yourself. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good luck, Reg. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How do you feel now? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will's been trying to get this piece right for ten years now. He's never made it through the solo. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Do you want to talk about it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There must be other unexpected events you have to deal with. Anuntimely death, an accident. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, how did you feel about the Captain, about your father? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Give Clara a chance. As she learns to make friends on theEnterprise, you'll probably find that she'll leave her imaginary worldbehind. Captain's log, stardate 45852.1. The Enterprise hasarrived at four seven, a nebula which has formed around a neutronstar. We are eager to investigate this unique formation. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Unless? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This isn't Starfleet Academy. You're not going to be coddled. Ifyou can't take it here, then you might think about a transport ship. There's a lot less pressure there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I won't be joining you. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Just be with him. You're a presence he trusts, and that's what heneeds most right now. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maques. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, her telepathic prowess is quite advanced. Except fornow. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. How big is a quantum filament? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your future affairs? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually, I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree toit. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We've all heard about you, and I felt certain things. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're feeling very vulnerable. Very mortal, if I may say so. Iknow you, Mother, and believe me, you will never be one of those whodies before they die. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Whatever happened, this is beginning to look less and less like aRomulan attack. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come on, Mother, let's sit down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, Data, no. This is too complex. This has to be a simple, clearmessage. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you? You don't really want to be ship's counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's king of his particular hill, Commander. You'll have to treathim that way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The Corvallens are mercenaries. Do they know what's in thesecontainers? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're a very entertaining patient. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery. Itstimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd better go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, will you please <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Would you care to join us, Captain? We have an opening. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Three days? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Our apologies. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Excuse me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This is my family. My friends here on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think I'm cut out to be Captain. First officer, maybe. Iunderstand there aren't many qualifications. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's been a pleasure serving with you, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Little One? You called me that when I was five. Now stopdemeaning me and address me as an adult! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I will release no one. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That same feeling. You seem familiar. You're the only thing thatdoes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It starts about a year after the wedding. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In class. I've alerted the teacher to expect us. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose oneword to assess his mood, it would be amused. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How did you know? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Definitely an elephant. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm trying to help the boy learn thevalue of responsibility. You're not helping by giving him a lot ofmixed messages. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's like waking up from a nightmare and notremembering what it was about. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's right, Lal. Just like me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But I can't help feeling that I'm taking something from her. Something precious. A part of her childhood she'll never have again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hannah, let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Whydon't we go for a walk? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He should be in his quarters. You ordered him not to leave. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Live with it. Computer, execute my original command. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: They're still at it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why don't you go with him, Worf? We'll see what we can do here. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know what an important day this is for you, the anniversary ofyour Rite of Ascension. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. Let me help you relax. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is fivehundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. Theyconsider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexityto avoid any future misunderstandings. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's the woman in Wyatt's drawings. Captain's log, stardate 41294.6. Orbiting Havenwith the Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question. Whatstrange of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone'simagination to appear on the plague ship? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It it felt like something beyond what we'd consider a life form. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My mother will be relieved. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know this is difficult for you. Is thereanything I can do to make you more comfortable? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We must not be separated. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's so like my mother to do the unexpected. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, we know so little about this culture and even less aboutKorgano. How would you convince Masaka that you're him? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Goodnight, Mister Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Can I have an order of Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If you'll deliver these men to us, we'll have them off yourplanet immediately. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell me aboutthe voices you hear. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Certainly, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In our dealings with other non-humanoid racesthere has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And we know they'll make good parents. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: The innocent often become the pawns in conflicts of this type,Wes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're going to need all your patience at Seronia. I can'timagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. They're very much in love, but sometimes that isn'tenough. Marriage is an agreement to share who you are with someoneelse. To spend your lives together. To grow old together. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Today would have been your husband's thirty eighth birthday. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I am not a mind control expert. I came here because I sensed youwere in pain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I agree, entirely. Mister Ral asked me not to tell anyone he hasempathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in anegotiation. And yes, it did put me in a conflict of interest, which Ihope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral has used your fear ofcontinuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies toundermine our position. I also believe that this incident was staged byRal and Goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of theChrysalians. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll bet Isabella is very pretty. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'd like to try that. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No. Because that would be the end of your fantasy. You'd know itwasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your storyis, the longer you can believe your mother's still alive. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Has the alien communicated? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, you're just trying to keep me here. Keep me from findingsomething. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: His emotions suggest that he's mischievous, irreverent andsomewhat brazen. The word that seems to best describe him is rogue. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I hear it. It's still there! It's so loud! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Liar. End this. Let us go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: How are you feeling? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: When Professor Manheim's name was mentioned, you reacted withintense emotion. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No! No! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, that was on the planet. This is much closer. Q <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let me talk with them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't follow you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Uh un. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Those you can see in the mirror. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's hard to tell. He is very closed, but he is hiding something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's very enthusiastic. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know it's been over between Will and me for a long time. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. Weconceptualise the universe in relatively the same way. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Perhaps his reunification talks were successful. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It was a better approach than asking you to allow hundreds ofcondemned prisoners on board. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I don't <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Not now. But soon. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think he's handling it very well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Brushing my hair. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In a way, you're very lucky. You might have a chance do what mostpeople can only dream about. Have a second childhood without the painof growing up again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Five of your people have been injured. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know what to think. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: An end to grief. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, eventerrified. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will, I didn't sense any deception from her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Stop it! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did I live here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I understand. I should have realised. Humans, young human malesparticularly, have difficulty separating platonic love and physicallove. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Good. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So I'm discovering. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Or economic forecasts. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if aunifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all intofocus. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Where they belong, Mother, Right under you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Why would someone do that? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are you doing here? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We'll just go and get a treat, and then <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you're putting your career at risk for him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You sent for me? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe it's time you stopped lying here worrying about your honour, and started thinking about someone else, like your son. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I came to ask if you'd like to go to a ceramics class. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, you do understand. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You know, I never particularly thought of you as an animalperson. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I prefer a mode of transportation that doesn't have a mind ofits own. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We are dealing with ancient codes involving procreation. Whilethey may be meaningless to us, to Debin they represent his honour. Hewill fight, risking himself, his crew, his daughter and her unbornchild. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I only want to help. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It has troubled you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Tell me one thing. Is there a solution? Or is this simply a testof my ability to handle a no-win situation? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: In her own way, Doctor Pulaski was instructing you to take theshortest route to victory. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alexander, that Klingon stuff is very important to your father. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: It's not quite his style. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you might need me if you have to negotiate with Taris again. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Once before you said double. What didyou mean? What is double? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: If we can't figure out what's wrong with her, Captain, I don'tthink she will. But I don't know what else to do. I've talked withMister Homn, who's known her for years. I've checked her medicalrecords. I've made enquiries to the government on Betazed, I'vecontacted her closest friends. If she's been through some kind ofpsychic trauma, there's just no evidence of it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You're looking very handsome. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Two minutes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I sense a touch of hostility here, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jev? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I think I should come with you, but I wanted you to knowbefore we went down. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What do your feelings tell you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I thought I was the empath. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Someone touching my hair. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive. First officer's log, supplemental. Theelectromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged toodangerous for anyone to transport down, so we have taken a shuttle toinvestigate. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race. We have to start from there. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. I sensed it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Exactly. Imagery is everything to the Tamarians. It embodiestheir emotional states, their very thought processes. It's how theycommunicate, and it's how they think. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You would like my opinion about you and Commander Daren. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: On the other hand <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Hello, Timothy. Are you ready to go? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sure the health and safety inspectionwon't last much longer. And in the meantime, I'm really glad that wehave this opportunity to get to know you. May I ask what businessyou're in? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think we've got something. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Am I a prisoner? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Actually no, it's more like they're not what they say they are. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What if they've chosen a course to the cosmic string? A case ofpure stimulus response, driven by instinct, just like the moth to aflame. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm able to feel much more from him now, Captain. His emotionsare still a jumble, but <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think we can start second guessing ourselves. I think wehave to proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Liko, you don't want to kill me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know things must look very strange to you, but everything'sgoing to be all right. No one's going to hurt you. We're friends ofNikolai and Worf. Don't be afraid. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your point of view. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Kestra was here a few moments ago. Talk to her. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's not very telepathic of you. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on ChandraFive. You willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, after that you ran away? The last I heard, you were the onlyFederation delegate assigned to Chandra Five. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: All I did was lose my temper. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Computer, make this a metal table. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Beverly! <eos>
 <bos> TROI: But it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a threeyear old boy, Eric Christopher. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We're not alone, Mother. Now how much longer is this going totake? You've been selecting for twenty minutes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe she can protect herself. After all, she has a great deal ofpower. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Will Riker and I are good friends. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: He's also deceased. His only living relatives are an aunt anduncle residing on Earth. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So, Jeremy, you must be very angry at Lieutenant Worf. He was incharge of your mother's mission, just as Captain Picard was in commandwhen Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right? Worf came back. Yourmother didn't. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Alex. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelingsare beside the point. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: No, I means you both agree to your responsibilities. And whenyou've done the things that you've agreed to do, then you've earned theprivilege to doing the things that you want to do. When he's cleanedhis room, for instance, then perhaps he's earned a visit to theholodeck to fight his alien monsters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Now, Commander. Watch and learn. In order to defeat your enemy,you must first understand them. The Federation wishes to avoid war atall cost. So I shall offer them a diplomatic solution, get them tolower their shields and then destroy them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Animals are worshipped in many cultures. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course. Chief. I'll take you to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I wouldn't call it resistance. More like uncertainty. Most ofthem had served under Captain Picard for several years. They knew him,they knew what he expected. Now they're being asked to adjust to a newcaptain and a new way of doing things, and they're uncertain how toreact. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sense nothing but good intentions from them, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Let me know how it goes. Goodnight, Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, we know he'll get his sleep. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: With your permission, Captain, there is one way to find out. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Mother, look. Perhaps some day I will marry. But you've got tolet me make my own choices, live my own life, and not the life youwould choose for me. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Maybe you could draw me a picture. I'd love to see what she lookslike. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: This part of you doesn't speak very often. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Well, er, your performance records have always been good. You'rethorough, dedicated. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Agreed. Also, he's arrogant, overbearing, self-important, andvery sure of himself and his ability. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I have to go. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Leave? You are going to die. No, you can't! Sickbay, this isCounsellor Troi, I need the Doctor in my quarters now! Ian! Ian, no. Ian. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Commander Riker didn't know how you managed it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Spirits? Ghosts? But you're a man who would never believe inghosts, Picard. Isn't that true? You see, Troi knows you. And so I doas well. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Orton is not as calm as he looks. He's very agitated and nervous,as if something's gone wrong. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You think they're weak. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you saying you don't remember the last three years? You don'tremember us falling in love and getting married? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Kate, I don't think he'd be where he is if he couldn't see thehuman side of the equation. Perhaps the two of you aren't all thatdifferent. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I don't think Jeremy's ready to accept Worf right now. Perhapslater, but it will have to be handled most delicately. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's what deactivated the Warbird's engine core. So theRomulans sent out a distress call. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a gameof intuition. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Are you afraid of what it might say? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Sir! Wonderful! A feeling of great joy. And gratitude. Great joyand gratitude, from both of them. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Then the flow of negative emotions and feelings were reversedback to him somehow. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's true. But cutting yourself off from your feelings cancarry consequences that are just as serious. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like whathappened in the nacelle tube. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Jeremy <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Ultimately, I believe he will. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Of course you do. But you didn't do this for yourself, you did itfor him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What are we going to do? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Was I? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Data. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: So you were angry with her? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'll keep trying. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an importantclue. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You, Klingon, tell him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That's correct. But now we have your ship and your bodies tocarry us home. RO <eos>
 <bos> TROI: We understand how difficult this will be for you. If you need arecess, please, don't hesitate to ask. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: That we get confirmation of this mission from our headquarters. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: What if it is just you? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: And the emptiness remains. You sound so alone. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leavinghim on Earth would not have protected him. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I know this much. We are unimportant to it. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: You'll have to decide that for yourself. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it wasunder construction? <eos>
 <bos> TROI: About you. I don't know anything about you. And I'd like to. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I'm sensing nothing from them Captain. Which could mean they canshield their thoughts and emotions from others. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: Your single-mindedness, your need to have this experiment work. <eos>
 <bos> TROI: I see. You believe that Karnas would not negotiate on that point,and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He laughed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That action injured you, and saved me. I will not forget it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As normal as ever, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed the assembly of thereplicated anatomy. I was able to provide Lal with more realistic skinand eye colour than my own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With permission to dig for the mine shaft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That sounds reasonable, sir. If they choose to go, I would bewilling to release the transporter lock out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to bethat, sir. But when they were probing my thoughts, Captain, I couldfeel that whatever they are now, they once existed in this dimension,just as we do. Perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form. Sincethen, however, they have evolved considerably. Their present existencein multi-dimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has beenaltered by the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, I could be in error. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have initialised the plasma induction coils. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. They are fully integrated components. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not necessarily. Commander Riker may be bluffing, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Difficult to explain, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Although I am an android, I have not excluded the possibilitythat I, too, may someday marry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only afacsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is Data, standing by to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have done as Captain Picard suggested. I have tried to explorethe images. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was not a request. I was simply talking to myself. A humanidiosyncrasy, triggered by fascination with a particular set of facts. Or sometimes brought about by senility. Or used as a means of weighinginformation before reaching a conclusion. Or, as a <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Happy birthday, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The music is on all communications channels, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. The bodies were found in the rubble after the stormhad passed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I believe I have an explanation. According to the plasmaconversion sensor, the starboard engine has been in continuousoperation for forty seven days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have thecuriosity of humans, but there are questions I will never have theanswer to. What is it like to laugh, or cry, or to experience any humanemotions. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My silence is not by choice, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Begin shuttlecraft launch sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Clearly you are some kind of intelligent form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This game is exceedingly simple. With only fifty two cards,twenty one of which I will see, and four other players, there are alimited number of winning combinations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a manner of speaking. The term artificial lifeform would bemore accurate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, warp engines are back online. We areready to commence restart sequences. Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. However, thereis no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause theinterference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Normal spatial relationships are often distorted within thematter stream. Your perceptions may have been exaggerated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Target one is emitting two thousand cubicmetres per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is self-repeating, of unknown pattern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer perform a level one diagnostic ofthe exocomp's command module. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why did you not return to the Potemkin with the others? 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because the cluster is two-dimensional, I do not have enoughdirect evidence to support that assumption. However, it is the mostreasonable hypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore also told me the colonists petitioned you to replace himwith a less perfect android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to theone that crashed. Interference from the star'sradiation will shield us from their sensors. We should remainundetected until they enter the system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All the Borg you have experimented on so far have sufferedextensive brain damage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Someone else will have to speak with them, not me. Not after whatI allowed to happen/ How could I? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you override? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shape is a paradox, sir. It cannot exist in real space ortime. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which is used in our construction. That particular compound is nomore suspicious, sir, than a human looking for an antiseptic or anointment. Nevertheless, I should check it out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am uncertain, sir. Sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could go over it with you now. It would not require more thantwo hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, is there a specific area you wish me to study? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The message does not elaborate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Devoras is dropping out of warp, sir. Their weapon systemsare powering up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alienpersonalities, in a sense, I am now empty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot stop our graviton signal, Captain. Doctor Marr hasisolated the access code. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increase the sensor field bandwidth. Patch in the lateral sensorarrays. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. Lieutenant Barclay appears inordinately preoccupied withhis physiological condition. I have seen him check his pulse rate, aswell as his visual acuity several times over the last twenty minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is the correct log. However, no information <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hold very still, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. You are capable of great sadism andcruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I should attempt to communicate withthe Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I amdisconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. I am an android. Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Except that I am not programmed to kill. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One moment, if you would. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then why are you stabilizing the conduit? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In solitude, there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment Ineed to research your father's illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Professor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then why are you annoyed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you determined how the electron resistance across the neuralfilaments is to be resolved? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yet there are still no life form readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise. Commander Data ready to beam aboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero sixterawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is an interesting. It would give them something in common. I do not understand, Counsellor. To what is he referring? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but the risk of structural collapse is quite high. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should go aboard the Romulan ship. The answer to thatquestion may <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will have to continue this another time. End programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense ofindividuality to them. It nearly destroyed them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, the curewas found in a plant indigenous to only Brekka, and which resisted allattempts at cultivation on Ornara. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid I cannot answer that Wesley. And as you are anewcomer to the game, may I say it is inappropriate for you to ask. Iwill buy another card, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this shouldn't be. Our ship's power systems are failing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can programme the ship's computer to supply simulations on theHolodeck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, prepare to drop shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I fail to recall how I arrived here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are moving out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The mechanism appears to be jammed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Better in some ways, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because I have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our projected survival would be approximately twelve seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Their reactor core is unstable, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I suggest a different approach? You were attempting toconstruct the upper level before the supports were in place. Observe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will die too, Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by sevenpercent, and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least an hour, but I do not believe much time can be saved byexhibiting such haste now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe we can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes areactually energy collectors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I've been reviewing the unmannedprobe scans. At some point during the last one hundred and fifty years,the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroidbelt. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been anoutbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. Weare on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague andtransport them to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully anantidote can be produced. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, begin scan phase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting thetable. It appears that within the disturbance, time is moving at anaccelerated rate, approximately fifty times faster than normal. Thedisturbance is spherical in shape. It is extending outward from thehull approximately seventeen metres from the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am glad, sir. It was his dying wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not think it would be wise to startle her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: and intense energy fields which appear to bestabil <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sickbay? Are you ill, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is what is written on the container. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiledin a war that lasted for several generations. Our best evidenceindicates they destroyed themselves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But what does one do if he has no instinct and intuition? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlikely as it may sound, I believe that the Enterprise may beforming an intelligence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortlyafter you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. It wassix months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formalpermission to court Counsellor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would bedishonourable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Tamarians have transported Captain Picard to the planetsurface along with their own captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the readings were correct. Their probe could have exitedthe wormhole at a completely different location. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, continuous playback please. There are approximately onethousand voices overlapping. The voices are those of the Enterprisecrew. Our voices. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is exactly where the ion trail is leading, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That beats my fours. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They're either unaware of me or choosingto ignore me. I am moving approximately ten metres north of my startingposition to observe more closely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The lifeform is emitting its high frequencytransmission. Energy consumption is rising, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are, to collaborate inproducing an explosion. If hydrogen is combined with another element,calendenium for example, it is extremely volatile. But would themessage mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Garvin, with your permission, I would like to begin my owninvestigation regarding the cause of your illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suspect the number was much greater. My impression is thatthere were thousands, of all ages and walks of life. It was aremarkable experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. I am an android. I am Lieutenant Commander Dataof the Federation Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Technically, Geordi, we were not wrong. Serova's theories restedon assumptions which were unprovable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gia, I believe I have found the answer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will be more observant in the future, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beam is coming from the centre of the vortex. Sensors show itto be only a mass of energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Careful, Captain. The stun effect from the wormhole wasrelatively severe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Warp and impulse engines are down, sir, but they can berestarted. A skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should continue this discussionnext week <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Very good, Commander. You have established a connection. I cannow raise the door. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The third ridge? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see. From limitless options I am reduced to none, or ratherone. I can only hope that Commander Maddox is more capable than itwould appear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A small force field containing xenon or another inert gas couldbe placed over the incision site. The explosive could possibly bedisarmed at the same time it is removed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, away team reporting in. LieutenantWorf standing by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Drop it or I will break his neck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Weeks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You did, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why, Doctor? It is done, and perhaps just as well. This hasindicated that I am damaged in some fashion. I must find themalfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But Commander Riker and Lieutenant Riker are. Yet they seem tohave trouble getting along with each another. I have found that humansvalue their uniqueness, that sense that they are different from everyone else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Couldthat be the source of the friction? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What happens to this man? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I do have a functional respiration system. However, itspurpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems. I am, infact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What level of communication, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No sir. We were unable to track it once it left the cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi? What is wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a magnifying device based on your hand-held instrument. Ihave refined the design to increase the magnification level. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Whatever it is, sir, we seem to be inside it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a holodeck audience. They were programmed to laugh ateverything. Perhaps I should reprogram the audience to display a moreaccurate response. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without the protection of the forcefields, we are completelyvulnerable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The images I saw during the time I was shutdown were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in myneural net. I believe Doctor Soong incorporated those circuits into mybase programming, intending to activate them when I reached a certainlevel of development. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first phaser blast will beapproximately nineteen seconds in duration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Even if I chose to do so, it is doubtful that my programmingcould be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Ferengi have broken off their attack. Drop shields. Transportthe away team aboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A standard isolation procedure would be advisable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shuttlecraft One to Enterprise. Prepare for docking sequence <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No response, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. While exploring astrange void in space without any form of matter or energy, we haveapparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it. After a briefdisruption, our ship's communications have returned to normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him. A higher setting may kill him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And apparently, the Captain destroyed the ship without notice orprovocation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The records of the Stargazer, sir. What the Ferengi call theBattle of Maxia. It seems the Captain's personal log contains a muchdifferent version of that conflict than the official historic account. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Medical emergency. Doctor Pulaski to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry for that, but it is very complicated. Does your familyknow where you are? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe each slot is designed for a specific Borg. Here is where the connection is made. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Verified, sir. Something very small. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first Federation outpost was established thirty four yearsago on Boradis Three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryonparticles. We believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspacemanifold. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No change, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, you have anticipated my denouement. However, thesentiment is appreciated. I will continue. Oh, Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display Connote a fairly well developed cognitive array. And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But it is only a small science station. It has limited defensivecapabilities. I do not believe it could withstand an attack from themercenary ship. Mister Worf. Send a message to the Federation outposton Calder Two. Advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vesselapproaches, they should attempt to delay it until our arrival. Ensign,take us out of orbit. Set course for the Calder system. Warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot do that, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nor do I. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is anancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where CaptainPicard was killed were also Romulan in origin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is visible, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is theoretically true, but even at this level of input youare already experiencing dangerous neural feedback. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no change in the graviton field. The torpedoes arehaving no effect, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must free the crewmen. She appears to be our best hope ofdoing so. In addition, I have become used to her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Timothy no longer has that kind of support. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. It is emitting an unusual signal. Captain,it is beginning to generate a verteron field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Heading three five one mark eleven, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No doubt you have applied your technology from other industriesto the refinement of this product. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the ship is not at the pre-arrangedcoordinates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The soliton wave has closed to tenkilometres, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it is changing shape. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have established a relay link with the sensor probe we left onthe perimeter of the Nebula. This is the convoy. We are expecting theMaquis attack force to cross the border from the Demilitarised Zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, restore holographic image. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In an effort to be helpful, I am attempting to calculate thevariables involved in a successful marriage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In disrupting the detection net, the Romulans may have caused aresidual tachyon signature to form around their own ships. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, there is a celebration on the Holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is taking too long. We should have been there by now. He ismanipulating you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How do you know that, Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The alternative is Vacca Six. It is located in the Cabral sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, by taking this action you risk charges ofassault, theft, piracy, and treason. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The power grid is located beneath this deck, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, he may refer to an incident which occurred nine yearsago in the Maxia Zeta star system, in which an unidentified starship <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. Please arrange to take Kivas Fajo into custody oncharges of murder, kidnapping, theft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be an energy vortex of highly complex patterns. Possibly a life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, our sensors indicate that the microbrain expends atremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle. Yet there isno discernible power drain on our own systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah! Intriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not possible. My internal chronometer indicates you havebeen gone for exactly one minute, fifteen seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The anomaly cannot be seen, but I believe I can enhance it with awarp field to make it visible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What about fire? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry I could not be more helpful, Doctor Pulaski. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: CO2 concentrations remain unchanged atupper elevations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. It is a most unusual phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At some future date I will be transported back to nineteenthcentury Earth, where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have had a considerable spectrum of occupations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Security alert. Medical emergency team to the Observation lounge. Data to Bridge. Raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenaryship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I saw the plaque 'The Home of the Red Headed League' and thisrope dangling from the bell, which enabled me to deduce that MisterJabez Wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimelydemise. From this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In order for the deception to succeed, it would have to appear tobe a natural phenomenon. Verteron particles are artificial in nature. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A possibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The translator is now offline, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The visor is active. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The long range and infra-red sensors apparently suffered illeffects as a result of the wormhole. We are presently checking neutrinoand heavy particle detectors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is your position? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a human physiological response to humour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would seem to be a necessary first step. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Congratulations, Professor, I capitulate to the better man. Yourvictory, sir, is well earned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our originalposition. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving relayed sensor data from the VegaProbe, including visuals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On a molecular genetic level? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will beless enjoyable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. It is becoming easier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am curious about something. If you met a double ofyourself, would you have difficulty interacting with him? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Beginning several thousand years ago, the two worlds tookdifferent paths. Ornara became technologically sophisticated, Brekkadid not. Then two hundred years ago, Ornara was stricken by adevastating plague. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cake? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is another possibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation. I have clearly determinedPardek's routine. On days when the Senate is not in session, heinvariably comes to this section after the median hour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mariposa. The Spanish word for butterfly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid his true destination remains a mystery. Readings nowindicate an open access panel in Jeffries tube N eleven, deck thirtyeight. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must get him to the runabout. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In that circumstance, re-establishing control should be our toppriority. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rupture is beginning to expandagain, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then there was the concert in Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you are correct, Counsellor, I believe they have already toldus what to do and are waiting for us to do it. When we are ready, theonly message you should attempt to convey is, now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I have recently reminded others, sir, I have no feeling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You mentioned your impending death, Grandpa. May I say you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When the interface malfunction occurred, subroutine C forty sevenwas replaced by elements from my personal programming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy. Thebiofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Merely throwing myself into the part, Watson. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The dispersion trail continues in this direction. Theconcentration gradient definitely increases along this vector. The escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. We are copying records for Federation inspectionpursuant to their application for admittance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. I cannot stun my cat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Still no readings of any kind, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, what is the time, please? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no trick. I had no magic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain. I have no unusual readings, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He has been in public service since he was a young man, a senatorfor nine decades. He is considered a man of thepeople. He has sponsored many reforms. Reportedly, Romulan leadershipconsiders him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been anadvocate of peace throughout his career. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Lantree's First Officer exposed your children to Thelusianflu for the first time. Their active immune systems set out to attackthe virus, and once it was triggered, it kept going. The antibodycreated an unexpected side-effect. It alters the genetic make-up ofnormal humans. This is a comparison of the normal and altered DNA. These are the two molecules that have been transposed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans. However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, thecomputer in my quarters has an independent processing and memorystorage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboardinertial damping system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are slowing to impulse, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is difficult to explain. Counsellor Troi's body was a cake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sector one nine six five eight, sir. I am unable to access it'smain computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, do you believe Ardra is, to use the vernacular, a conartist? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks, sir. Repair time, three point six days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least another six hours, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system. Perhaps weshould try to pinpoint the exact moment when events becamediscontinuous. Do you remember the first change? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero zero six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are caught in an energy damping field, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have no indication of a transmission of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So you agree with Okona that I am missing avery important human factor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will take approximately nine and one half hours to completethe analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars asarms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advancedweaponry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. You must now change the input matrix in my secondaryoptical port and then connect the conduit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart. AndCaptain Picard has authorised me to share with you any information weobtain from the Romulan databanks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tarella was class M, much like your Earth, with similar humanoidlife forms. Unfortunately they faced the old story of hatred out poweringintelligence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are disobeying the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: His molecular structure is destabilising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've been delivered here against my wishes. I would like to knowthe reason. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probable cause? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But are we doing a good thing now, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The substance appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria,capable of doubling itself in size every fifteen minutes. It seems tobe reacting with two of the compounds present in the Enterprisestructure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know, but you leave me no other choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You don't tell me how to behave. You're not my mother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship has moved into warp, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They may merely have poorly developed language skills. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know the way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. It has become clearthat everyone aboard the Enterprise has lost an entire day. As themystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continuesto deepen, so do my doubts about Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer. Recognise Data, Lieutenant Commander. Alpha Oneclearance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do youwish me to deactivate Lal? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And I have studied your design for the particle fountain. I findthe concept to be highly innovative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see. The concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is curious that I was so easily misled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Minimal oxygen atmosphere. An ancient solargenerator, still operating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have to beam back and get them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The radiation signature is similar to the original pattern, butwith significant differences. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Wellington is the only Federation vessel in this sector. Itreports normal operations. A Ferengi ship within communications rangealso reports nothing unusual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She will? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. You just sit tight. We'll have this all fixed up intime for supper. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The odds favour standing pat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When one of my friends is distraught, I have learnt that thethoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It sounds intriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting a vessel holding position nearthe third planet. It is a Yridian freighter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I project a ninety percent probability that they will continue tosupport that policy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, density appears to be lower off the starboard bow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shipwide life support failure in fifteen seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis, section by section. Trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed thecolony at Omicron Theta. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suppose I have learned to be creative, sir, when necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiencesare almost always culturally derived, and I have no culture of my own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Confirmed, sir. And there was a rather peculiar limerick beingdelivered by someone in the Shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure Iunderstand it. There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shapedlike <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk Iremoved from the module's computer. Her name is Clare Raymond, agethirty five, occupation homemaker. Must be some kind of constructionwork. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can reconfigure the primary sensor array. If we narrow theirfocus to scan for E-band emissions, we might be able to calculate adirectional vector. But only if there are more occurrences. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shuttle is emerging from the corona, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot explain it. It is not an image I saw during my vision. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The field imbalance has subsided. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no need to apologise. I was not offended. Would you likea pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. But my programme does include military strategy. That is howI was able to anticipate your final tactic and capture you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In that particular moment, I was reconfiguring the warp fieldparameters, analysing the collected works of Charles Dickens,calculating the maximum pressure I could safely apply to your lips,considering a new food supplement for Spot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Confirmed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The neural link will be established in three stages. Doctor, Isuggest you closely observe Captain Picard's lifesigns, while at eachstage Chief O'Brien monitors my positronic matrix activity. Counsellor,hopefully, you will be able to determine whether I am reaching CaptainPicard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I must hurry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Through deduction, sir. Lieutenant Barclay and I tried totransport a simulated object off the holodeck, something that has neverbeen attempted. Since the transporter itself is a simulation, thecomputer had no real data from which to create the transport logs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Once I have adjusted the forcefield, I will no longer be visible,Commander. I have taken steps, however, to ensure that you will stillbe able to hear me. If you would assist me in a test of the comm. system. My voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phaseadjustment. That should allow me to maintain verbal contact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not familiar with <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a polarised magneticdistortion to our port side. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Also seen as a source of status and virility. Often a primeingredient in teenage mating rituals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The star has entered a period of increased activity. Sensorsindicate that the solar flares will continue to grow. In three hours,our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not recognise the sound. I believe it is coming from above. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have compensated. Still no readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, it is not in the same sector, but another opening hasappeared. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonicinterference. It is impossible to obtain a positive lock on thebulkheads. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no life signs. However, there are several small poweremanations, and life support is still functioning on minimal levels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not perceive your skills to be in doubt, Q. The Captain ismore concerned with your ability to interact successfully with hislittle trained minions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Black Cluster was formed almost ninebillion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in closeproximity. The resulting gravitational forces are both violent andhighly unpredictable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There's Klingon in the wound. It is saliva. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is for the greater good. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mostly electromagnetic, sir. Fusion generator and batteries downby thirty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard amedical ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are on the Bridge of the Enterprise. My cat is present, mypotted plant, and my paintings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is almost as if <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, locate Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where are the Bynars? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was of course not serious about calling Security. It was ajoke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to do so. However, I must ask you to stop yourexperiment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He's telling the truth. Their heading haschanged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Moseley's computers can accomplish the same task, sir. butGeordi would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we can use phase buffers we may be able todevise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system whileit is in operation. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary data suggests it is stillcapable of supporting life. We have been unable to find definite signsof current habitation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. Are you not going toallow Tam to fulfill his mission? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. However, the console displays indicate a power transfer inprogress between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship at the moment timedecelerated. That is why there is a second beam between the two ships. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: True, but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technologyintroduced at the conference which I discovered could be used to laydown complex neural net pathways. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The event is approximately zero point one light years indiameter, and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryonradiation. It appears to be what Rabal and Serova predicted, a subspacerift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My skills seemed appropriate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The record will stand until the year 2026, when a shortstop forthe London Kings <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is reading incredible amounts of energy, sir. Even more sincewe have taken down the shield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. Only hearsay and third hand reports, most of whichconflict. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. We are no doubt advanced in some areas, they inothers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a probe of some kind, but there is no Starfleetrecord of this shape or design. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, if Koral wishes to contest our actions he can file aprotest with the Judge Advocate General's office. Bring the shuttleaboard. Then you and Doctor Crusher can begin the inspection. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One is meant kindly, the other is not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You called me Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They areevolutionary holdovers, sequences of that provided key behaviouraland physical characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longernecessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gill slits and otheramphibious characteristics were derived from introns which stillcontain amphibious codes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dytallix B is one of seven uninhabited planets mined for theFederation by the Dytallix Mining Company. It is in the nearby Mirasystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, where are the Captain and CommanderRiker? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Less than exemplary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These appear to be some kind of power wave guide conduits whichallow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, the interface circuitry which links the exocomp to thecontrol pad is completely burned out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true, but it was enough to get my attention. Later, Inoticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes. The intervalsbetween blinks were governed by the Fourier system, the samemathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern theappearance of randomness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would like to learn how to dance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: La Forge, I got the Intrepid's power conversion levels up toninety seven point one percent. Maybe you should try cleaning yourplasma grid once in a while. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resistyour wishes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And light, as if they were made for women to use. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are many opinions. On Galvin Five, a marriage is consideredsuccessful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding. Andorian marriages require groups of four people unless <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As a matter of fact, I find it oddly amusing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Think back. Are you sure that was the very first change? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. I will need to run a diagnostic to becertain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I feel no disorientation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I am not ill? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe does allow Geordi to sense quantum fluctuations,subspace anomalies, and other phenomenon not perceptible by any otherkind of sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nine minutes, forty seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we go back to the Devron system now, we might be able to seethe initial formation of the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which would you place first, the welfare of a single individualor that of the entire crew? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would like that very much. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will attempt it, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Danar is extremely adept, sir. I am not certain which securitymeasure he is attempting to circumvent. Sir, Danar has succeeded inrestoring power to shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gather your belongings. It is time to leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has been over an hour since we heard the Entity, sir. It maybe gone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the procedure is successful, your cognitive processingfunctions will be considerably improved. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do understand, and I am attempting to explain to you it isimpossible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Feline supplement one hundred twenty seven. Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designedfor your highly selective tastes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please clarify. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hull breach is imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The game is seven card stud. After the queen, one-eyed jacks andlow card in the hole are wild. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we could deceive his neural receptors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, have you ever had a nightmare? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She only wanted to get to Troi and Lieutenant Prieto. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have located a new home for the Boraalans, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears it be a Cardassian supply ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. Sensors are detecting highly acceleratedinterstellar gases. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What puzzles me, Captain, is how she is expected to bring peaceto Daled Four. Its inhabitants have been fighting throughout theirrecorded history. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My Watson? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Like a full collapse, sir? Any stellar material it threw this waywe could still outrun on half impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Four seconds to arrival, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the warp engines fail to function, the result could beunfortunate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Still no damage to the Borg vessel, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am always careful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data? Before me, he was nothing. Just a walking tin can withcircuits for intestines. Pathetic. Without heart, a man is meaningless. I would not come up here if I were you, Captain. I might not like it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbanceon a small area of the planet's surface. Forty two degrees sevenminutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm sorry, sir, but Stellar Cartography has requested acommunications blackout while they run an experiment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a likely hypothesis. The nomadic marauders who refer tothemselves as Gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouringsectors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, sir. On my way. Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We haveencountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six. It is not nativeto this region of space, and there is no previous record of this objecton any Federation charts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I estimate the core breach will consume the Enterprise inapproximately seven hours, two minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is ridiculous. I am as healthy as a Rigelian ox. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am fully versed, sir, on all your theories regarding time andgravity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you saying the question cannot be answered? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Check her positronic matrix. There may be a cascade anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support,penetrating my secondary subprocessor. Fortunately, none of mybiofunctions seem affected. Do not be concerned, Counsellor. I believeyour aim is improving. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity,which the Romulans use in their engine, for a natural one. A blackhole. They tried to use it as a nest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My orders are to escort you to the Observation Lounge. Pleasecome with me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It's a trick. He is trying to divide us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emitan inverse tachyon pulse, which could scan beyond the subspace barrier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These kittens were born less than twenty four hours. It wouldappear that Spot's transformation took place at approximately the sametime. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This planet may have been the most distant outpost, sir, but itshows no life form readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but Tyrellian laser art is very similarin both form and composition. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have analysed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It has beenunaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as atemplate for a retrovirus. It would neutralise the synthetic T-cell,and re-establish the original genetic patterns of each host. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no way anyone can prevent it, sir. At some future date,I will be transported back to nineteenth century Earth, where I willdie. It has occurred. It will occur. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Within the next five hours, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below theplanet's surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How canI reproduce a sound with clay? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. She was killed as a demonstration of the creature's power,without provocation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Blue, blue, blue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warp core breach has been reversed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I'm afraid the only entry we haveon Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hull temperature rising. Two thousanddegrees. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Neither side intended Orelious Nine to be the decisive conflict. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are approaching Kalla Three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The land contours are familiar, sir. Topographically, this is thecorrect area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a valid projection. It is apparent that my reach hasexceeded my grasp in this particular area. I am perhapsnot nearly so human as I aspire to become. If you are ready to eat, Iwill bring our meal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am assisting Commander La Forge with a very complexcalculation. It demands a great deal of my concentration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Slow to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course you do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How is your diplomatic assignment progressing? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal, the third crosslink transfer series is complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Course set, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destructionin a manner that would have an emotional effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible withour power systems. Warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded. I am attempting to compensate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In fact, they seem to be appearing at random. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I am not looking for my father. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, I live here now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As we continue, Captain, they are virtually learning the conceptof communication. Each new generation is making modifications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. Will that be sufficient, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you know where she went? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not entirely certain they will, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why did you create me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Four days at warp six, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The problem's originating in Sickbay. There has been anunauthorized access into the computer's bio-imaging systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dealer folds. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is all a question of probabilities. Quitesimple, really, if one bets with any sequential consistency. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are sensing life-forms, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How many? How many more accidents? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but what is even more difficult is to get each side tolisten, really listen to each other, and to understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will cost you twenty to make that determination, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pardon me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical stylesof over three hundred concert violinists, including Heifetz, Menuhin,Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have a preference? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand it involves deep meditation in the lava caves ofNo'Mat. That prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatoryeffect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am confident they will. Commander La Forge is especially <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This has been an interesting encounter, and an altogetherunexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before weproceed further. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are correct in that I have no frame of reference to confirmmy hypothesis. In fact, I am unable to provide a verbal description ofthe experience. Perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry. Icould then use that as a reference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, if indeed you have the power of Q. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain, Commander, but the dimensions are precisely the same. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard, do you have any further evidence to presentbefore I render judgment? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A neutrino pulse would send non-charged particles back up throughthe atmosphere and would be detectable by Geordi's Visor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They range from two to three metres inheight. Silver grey in colour. They have four limbs. No eyes or earsare noticeable. There is a single orifice where a humanoid foreheadwould ordinarily be. They are reclined against therock face surrounding an apparatus of some sort approximately one pointfive metres in height. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir. I will not look in yourdirection. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Several, sir. The nearest is approximately three light hours fromour present position. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path. Source unknown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And were the Ullians present? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be most beneficial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That explains the chroniton fields I am detecting in here now. For your own safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to theanomalous construction of the Ferengi brain, which is composed of fourdifferent <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That should suffice. Is there something occupying your thoughts,Jenna? You seem somewhat subdued today. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields are down, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Matter injector is online. Antimatter injector still locked. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: More particularly, that our opposition does indeed consist of twomen, and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged DoctorPulaski. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has been quite a day, has it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility accesscorridors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Within the norm of Klingon patterns, of course. Discretion willbe required. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights andstatus. Am I a person or property? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am rarely in need of Doctor BeverlyCrusher's professional services as my bio-mechanical maintenanceprogramme is self sufficient. But I often observe as she practicesmedicine on others and have learned a great deal about humaninteraction from her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir. I see time as aconstant, whereas humansperceive time as flexible. Hence the expression, times flies whenyou're having fun, which until now has always confused me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The lateral EM scanners register radiation levels indicative of aclass-M planet. Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are half human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with thefact that my father never mentioned her to me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought Iwas on Barkon Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As they increase, it will become progressively more difficult tocontrol the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You condone homicide, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The area around the duck blind exhibits Karst topography. Sinkholes, underground rivers, and caverns. And the rock strata containa high concentration of thallium compounds which may be obstructing oursensor beams. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with yourperformance as First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eight. Ace. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Theoretically, yes. In reality I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I am pleased to say it was damaged when I was forced to fireon Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it is conceivable, even for me, that time will eventuallylead to irreparable circuit failure. But there is one thing I do notunderstand. Sarek is a logical, intelligent being. The effects ofBendii Syndrome are apparent. Why would such a man choose to ignorethem? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The mesosphere is gone. Plasmonic reactions are now beginning tobreak down the troposphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, our medical facility may be able to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would need to see the programme schematic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was capturedwhile leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of aheart attack before his trial ended. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher and I discovered that the exocomp did not fail thetest. It is still my belief we are dealing with a new life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our sensors show an immense volume of energy emanating deepwithin the planet, and concentrated near Manheim's remaininglaboratory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot penetrate Borg power subcommandstructure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Klingon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jenna, you are repeating yourself. I have often found this to beindicative of mental distraction. Is that a correct assumption in thisinstance? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been formulating nutritional supplements for Spot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unable to penetrate defence systemscommand structure <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it a security vessel from the planet Straleb. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To create this radiation field would take several hundredthousand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That being the case, I find it difficult to understand whysomeone would deliberately terminate their own existence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As he bypasses each subsystem, I can re-route it without hisknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Port thruster is firing. Sir, the gravitational attraction of thevarious masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. By mycalculations, we no longer have sufficient momentum to clear the debrisfield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Noranium alloy, sir. It's salvage value is quite low. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees. Of course, noraniumcarbide <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. The Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then a name, or a place. It could besomething personal. In this case, in binary language, which is ones andzeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the radiation and debris are consistent with an overloadof the station's reactor core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you think the others will think this service appropriate? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I said that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, readings correspond with the findings of the probe. Nosigns of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am getting energy readings. Look out! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr, you have made it clear that my presencedisturbs you. However, I do not see how we can achieve our task if youcontinue to ignore me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The train we encountered was from one of Doctor Crusher'sholodeck programs. It was a re-creation of the Orient Express, a trainwhich travelled from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth centuryuntil. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The internal scans were negative. There wasno evidence of auditory anomalies anywhere on the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are aware, Counsellor, that the holodeck can be programmed torecreate an oceanic environment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. You are attempting to recreate the Dokkaran temple of KuralHanesh? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Graves at my command have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'emforth by my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and whenI have required some heavenly music, which even now I do, to work mineend upon their senses, that this airy charm is for, I'll break mystaff, bury it certain fathoms in the earth, and deeper than did everplummet sound, I'll Captain? Sir, your attention iswandering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittentsystem failures and power surges as a result. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe we have found the source of theradiation. Can you join us on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can do it, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Several different programs are running simultaneously. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Three. The vehicle has suffered severedamage. Most of her systems have failed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Also travelling at warp speed, sir. Intriguing. I can find nomatch with anything in our records, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Watson, the doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall. The other is shorter, left handed, and is employed in a laboratory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, warp pulse calculations arecomplete. We will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for sixpoint three seconds before disengaging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The thanks actually go to Doctor Clendenning on Omicron Theta whodid the first experiments with gamma scans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship. However,there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquaticlab. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. It is wrong of you to force us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We could then lower them in a controlled manner. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you compared the genetic code with the Ambassador's lastrecorded transporter ID traces? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We've been scanning the area since entering the system, but ourreadings are being disrupted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Rebuttal? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order toexperience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve themystery until then. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nor do I. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. Fold. To bend. To make compact or to capitulate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that because you place more value on biological life than onartificial life? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unfamiliar with the gentleman's name. I have spoken toseveral people at that office. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am glad you approve, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My entity's artificial substructure may be useful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Hood is slowing to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severenavigational hazard towarp driven vessels. The Hekaras Corridor is the only route through thearea which is free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must usethe Corridor to ensure safe passage through the region. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations,direct insubordination is a court martial offence. But I will notrelease the transporter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a warning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twicefor disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a solar flare, Captain. Magnitude twelve, class B. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This will be the last trip, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is a big decision <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the probe's energy output is overloading our shields. Failure anticipated in forty seven seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Subspace signal coming from Starfleet, Captain. Admiral Kennelly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Injectors open. There is no engine activity at all, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Iconian programme is attempting to rewrite my software. Physical manifestations, blindness, motor con <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor oftwelve. At this rate, it will have increased by a factor of two hundredby the time it reaches Lemma Two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was that intended to be an affirmative? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. The visor uses a subspace field pulse. I believe thatwhenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantumflux and pushed Worf into another reality. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques,a broad variety of pleasuring, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Guinan, Lal needs to observe human behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Temperature in the reaction chamber has returned to normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its owninterface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Counsellor. He does know. Mister Worf, prepareto drop the shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They will scan the debris and discover I was not aboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to mybrother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Communication lines have been terminated atthe transmitter, but I am quite certain the message was sent prior tothe interruption. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles. We may beable to derive a pattern the computer would recognise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly. I will attempt to resequence the signal. Begin runninga search for a decryption key. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cloaked Romulan ships could produce that effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Take him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I believe I have found an obscure precedent in Ventaxian lawwhich may be of interest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When we are ready to disconnect theinterface, we must allow enough time to lower the input levels,otherwise your nervous system will go into shock from the sudden dropin input. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you currently experiencing this phenomenon? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you do not feel capable of carrying out this role, I willassign it to Commander La Forge and return you to Tactical. I would notenter it into your record as a reprimand, simply as a transfer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jump. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The power source, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If Doctor Manheim's information is correct, by my calculations,the next time distortion should occur between twenty eight to fortyseven minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Android, of course, is correct, but I fail to see how chaperon isapplicable in this situation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then what is the difference between sending the message anddelivering it personally? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The streak they refer to will eventually reach fifty six games. And be snapped by a pair of journeyman hurlers for the ClevelandIndians. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To what are you referring? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I appreciate your concern, Captain, but, to employ an aphorism,one cannot cheat fate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, that is an order. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can hear you coming, Captain. My ears are better than theaverage dog's, you know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She also expressed a desire to leave the colony. She hopes toapply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, good morning, sir. Ship status is <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why would we do that? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All decks reporting minor injuries only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You said in the transporter room that you could not read my mind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two hours nineteen minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. In her case, the has created an amphibiouslifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mordan has had peace for five years. They have finally come to astate of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but nomore than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation couldprovide them with more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, I must join Commander La Forge in Engineering. If youwill excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is very gracious of you to say, Doctor, but I have not beeninjured by you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, thrusters are losing power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They seem to have made some technological leaps forward,Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitonsinteract with the new engine core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify herassertions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a quantum fissure in the space-time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are beginning to overload. Ibelieve Serova's attempting to create a warp core breach. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter. For my ninthpoem, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I implore you, do not reactivate him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our current speed, we will clear the nebula in twelve minutesfour seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of theship. It would be much easier for him to capture and consume one ofthem, than to attempt to break through a door. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish to speak. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thrusters at half power. Three quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a complex question, Lal. I can only begin to answer bytelling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to theworld in which we live. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do not wish to rehearse? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Keiko's wedding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I apologise for my premature assumption. This particularpoem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes. You may experience theemptiness with me if you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Frequency open and secured. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My positronic brain is a technology unknown to the Paxans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, situation analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe that is so. Your rhythmic control has improvedmarkedly. I heard no fluctuations during the performance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons, highenergy X-ray lasers and merculite rockets. No match for the Enterprise,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is a vast underground power source which iscontrolled by this console. I believe my triggering of the gateway hascaused a dramatic upsurge in power level. Ah, I have access. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Android. Artificial life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected theradioactive fragments. I was attempting to download the sensor logsfrom the probe's onboard computer. There was a power surge. I believethe surge overloaded my positronic matrix. After that, I have no memoryuntil this moment. It appears I had aninteresting time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will. Thank you, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tractor beam will not be successful. I am decompressing themain shuttlebay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Feline supplement number two twenty one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not beable to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Integrity-field pressure has increased by two hundred seventeenpercent, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask the purpose of your request? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our sensors can identify artificial lifeforms, sir. Apparently,he is capable of deceiving the sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rupture is beginning to close, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have made micro-tomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber,the hatch mounting, the blast pattern from the explosion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no prior record of this type of accidentoccurring aboard a starship. Backup systems and safeguards are designedto prevent just such an occurrence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask the purpose of your journey? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you referring to the Elway Theorem? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are ready to have you beamed up,Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three pointsix hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The remaining cases of hytritium are nowbeing loaded. PICARD <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around ayoung woman named Jenina. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Strictly speaking, sir, it is not my playing. It is a preciseimitation of the techniques of Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bronken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a ship in the Neutral Zone. Configuration, Romulan warbird. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why have you stolen these objects? To put in a museum? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments. They may provide a clue to my identity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading significant power fluctuations from the stationcore. Please report. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Specifics, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, energy loss increasing to five percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will run the integrity scan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I have never done this before. Initiating firstneural link. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. Activating Bussard collectors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, our options are very limited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I am studying several new techniques. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Typically, the purpose of such an enclosureis for storage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so. I will make another attempt. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor. I did not have a chance to apologise for my actions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What happened to her? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Foley discovered this in the pond. Thespecies is Zan Periculi. It is not indigenous to Betazed, but to LappaFour. A Ferengi world. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, since we obtained only minimal information on our sensorpass of it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. Do you need totalk about it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: General quarters sounded, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing so far, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In fact, there have been many ages which have come and passedsince Makto. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, may I ask a favour of you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard? I have amalfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scout ship is severely damaged, Captain. Engines inoperative,shields are down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Despite your suggestion that I continue? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As opposed to what? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then why not rely strictly on the facts? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two of the silver-grey entities areapproaching it. They have released the forcefield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All information is time-coded by entry, and the bits when totaledproduce an aggregate amount which <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The computer is processing the data. I will be notified as soonas there is any information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is part of her training programme. I am teaching Spot to jumpdown from the desk on my command. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My station is on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support thatassumption. As with the other terms used by the Tamarian, this appearsto be a proper noun. The name clearly carries a meaning for them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Compare these variations with established Romulan replicationpatterns. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, he was pleased to have won a championship emblem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have located a vessel, sir. It is drifting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe I have a partial explanation. I have completedmy analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporalconvergence in the space-time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The people of Kaelon Two are isolationists, almost to the pointof being xenophobes. Regrettably, we know very little about theircustoms. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I walked here from the mountains. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. It consumes fuel to produce energy, it grows, it createsoffspring. By your definition, is it alive? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to findmeaningful patterns in things that are essentiallyrandom. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggestwhat they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it isclearly a bunny rabbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Heading, Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tactical station. Where Lieutenant Worf is now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I may, sir. One of the things about them in the briefingstudies was their respect for patience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is water. A substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My right to choose. Perhaps my very life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is definitely debris. The primary material is duranium, withsmaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am glad that you understand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It provides tactile sensations so that Geordi can feel he's inthe same environment as the probe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. We must vary shield shape and strength as rapidly aspossible. Maximum shields will only speed the ship's takeover. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enduring physical suffering is considered a Klingon spiritualtest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. Are you planning on going into the holodeck? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You tend to underestimate humans, my brother. Praising youngWesley on the helm, for exampleLORE <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the game of poker, there is a moment when a player mustdecide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winninghand. This decision is based not only on the odds, but also on anappraisal of the man. Is he bluffing or does he have the cards? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. That would be wrong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Setting a course for Starbase two twenty. Sir, as my final dutyas Acting Captain, I order you to bed. I shall do the same for allpersonnel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Lantree is a Class Six Federation supply ship assigned toGamma seven sector, Captain L. I. Telaka commanding. Normal complement,twenty six officers and crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have a few words to say, sir. Just look at that face. The face of a thinker. A warrior. A man for allseasons. Yes, Ira Graves was all that and more. But he was not perfect. Perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless. He cared toomuch for his fellow man, with nary a thought for himself. A man oflimitless accomplishments, and unbridled modesty. I can safely say thatto know him was to love him. And to love him was to know him. Those whoknew him, loved him, while those who did not know him, loved him fromafar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intersection eight J, aft port. Establish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One might also conclude that it brings me one step closer tobeing human. I am mortal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, an energy field is forming around the device. Intensityis three point two terawatts and increasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would certainly be sufficient, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, you are putting me in a difficultposition. Please, cease your descent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an accepted custom that we wear clothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must shut it down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Considering the absence of debris, Captain,it is reasonable to assume the Klingon vessel is in the area andcloaked. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, you are fifteen minutes early. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can reverse the polarity of their forcefields to isolate thisroom. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force inthe cause of defense. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Chancellor. Minister. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the quantum fissure we discoveredis a fixed point across the space time continuum. A keyhole whichintersects many other quantum realities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then what do you believe I am? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But he needs his study time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, there are other ways to challenge oneself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment,I had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a connection, sir. I am now stabilising the containmentfield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away byvisible distortion effects. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ishara. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, if I give my life to save my fellow officers, that ismy choice. The exocomps no longer have a choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it is likely the anomalous readings were the result of thewormhole's effect. It was extremely unstable. I would recommend againstreturning. It might put the Enterprise at further risk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However,your methods leave much to be desired. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Project emitter beam, heading zero two four mark zero four one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One moment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crewwhom Spot seems to like. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to geta precise reading. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we coast into the rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She has been abducted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By matching gene types, Starfleet wasable to identify the boy as Jeremiah Rossa. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I do not understand how this could have happened. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. I suggest we look around to see if anybody ishome. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronicsubprocessor. But I am fine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to thedistress call. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are Doctor Juliana Tainer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath, thechances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is expanding toward us, sir. It appears to be interfering withour engines, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? There is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bringany information up on it. Science two does not function either, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am French, sir, not Swiss. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Something to write home about. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forcedpulse, well into the terahertz range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The delay will also make it possible for Stellar Dynamics tocomplete their study of the Vodrey Nebula. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emergency medical team to Doctor Crusher'soffice immediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Time to impact approximately sixty seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Throughout the ages, from Keats to Jorkemo, poets have composedodes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives. Inkeeping with that tradition, I have written my next poem in honour ofmy cat. I call it Ode to Spot. Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature. Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses Contribute to your hunting skill and natural defences. I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations. A singular development of cat communications That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection, For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection. A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents. You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance. And when not being utilised to aid in locomotion It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Federation abandoned its research in the field because thetechnology was found to be unreliable, as well as energy intensive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, three metre cross seal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tam? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the equipment is no longer functioning. However, theinformation currently displayed indicates that there was a massivepower surge in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bedside manner? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, please access all volcanic andtectonic plate activity in Drema Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are nearing the periphery ofSector twenty one five oh three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report shows that it deliberatelyattacked. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are tryingto demolish the ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, Freud'scautions at the other end, were warnings of the dangers around us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But is not honesty always the preferred choice? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Verbal composition at it's most sophisticated level. Yourchild-like mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of my words. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe I am qualified to express an opinion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, yes. That does seem only fair. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am establishing the interface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would tend to agree. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fear is a quality that I do not possess. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Extensive. The Captain's first diplomatic contact dates back to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enhance, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Hobson! You will carry out my orders or I will relieve youof duty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I hope you enjoy it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my next leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Well, we figure part of my memory structure wasreplaced with information from the computer's recreational data base. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton fieldemanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in thesubspace continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since we know nothing of these circumstances, it is at leastconceivable, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is likely that we overestimated the geologic stability aroundthe CO2 pockets, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Twelve point three million. Perhaps I will bet sevenhundred thousand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How could you tell? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the holodeck appears to be inoperation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Wesley's subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modifythe palm beacon. The optical burst patterns weprogrammed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects ofthe game. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An interesting approach. He must have been planning toreintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am capable of that function when it is expected of me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have returned to normal space. Navigational systems are stilloffline. I will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondarysystems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have maintained records on positronic matrix activity,behavioral norms, and all verbal patterns. I have seen no evidence ofother aberrations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Method of propulsion is unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, the sale price of this edifice is twelve point fivemillion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Visual contact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The signal is a standard mathematical progression. It does notcarry a specific message. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Computer, reset simulation totime index two point one. Increase Borg strength by thirty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Power loss now at twelve percent, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space. Twoships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero fiveone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the timerift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are clearing the phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am notcertain what would be an effective lure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. I hope the Captain remembers hisphysical pattern is here. If he has, his energy has moved into thetransporter relays by now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The evidence is fairly conclusive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Humanoid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not capable of either of those functions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi has altered her appearance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir. Eleven planets, unexplored. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must remind you that our objective is to bring Tin Man out ofdanger and report our findings to Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, in B'zal, a Ferengi code which uses an alternatingpattern of light and darkness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that he was viewing a synthetically generatedimage, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The appearance of Kahless in the lava caves is consistent withthe stories found in the Klingon sacred texts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We followed procedures precisely, Captain. Scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section. I cannotexplain how he escaped. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cat? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to employ plasma inputs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are a relatively benign species. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, sensors indicate fiveMintakans in your immediate vicinity. Four are motionless. The fifth iseight meters away, proceeding south. Is Nuria one of these five? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish, Counsellor. Check. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forty five seconds remaining. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that this telepathic communication is creatinginterference in the sleep of other species. That would explain whythe rest of our crew is not dreaming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have surveyed all the turbolifts and service crawlways on thisdeck. Access to the Bridge has been completely severed by emergencybulkheads. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correctmany malfunctions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I wish to submit myself for disciplinary action. I havedisobeyed a direct order from a superior officer. Althoughthe result of my actions proved positive, the ends cannot justify themeans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately ninety million kilometres from the star'sphotosphere. I am reading a great deal of surface instability. It maybe <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will compare my autonomic logs with the ship's chronometer. Perhaps we have overlooked something. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He's in the ship's circuitry. Come to the Transporter room,please. There might be a way, sir. Hurry! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are only as old as you feel. Try to remember that, boy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And a very good job of it I did of it, too. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She studies in our quarters. She requires very littlesupervision. Lal is quite self-sufficient. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our vehicle classification index can put no identity to it. Itsdesign is completely foreign. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would either of you mind if I made a personalinquiry? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unless they have all died. Their ship could have been brought inby automation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps. After I painted the smoke, it then occurred to me topaint a bird's wing. I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birdsflying in formation. An individual feather. If the image of a bird isrelated to my vision, I do not understand how. I am left with more of amystery than ever. Geordi, I would like to recreate the experimentwhich caused my initial shut down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, Commander. At Starfleet Academy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigationa hazardous one. A probe launched from our current position would bemore advisable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Due to this forcefield, there is presently no way to beam usback, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet Intelligence confirms that a shipmatching this configuration has been linked to raids on several otherplanets in this sector. For the short time it was within our visualrange, we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel. Itappears to be encased in an energy absorbing material. Although we cansee the ship, this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable toour long range sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Pakleds did hear our little fiction about Geordi's weaponsknowledge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starboard thruster firing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Undetermined. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work offiction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of theEnterprise. We will need a variable phase inverter, to align the powerfrom the Enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have consulted numerous animal training manuals. Some of themclaim that cats are inherently untrainable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My service experience does not yet warrant such a position. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Senior officers, please report to the Captain's Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Her is in a state of ribocyatic flux. Her genetic codes arebeing re-sequenced and her cells are mutating as a result. At afundamental level, sir, she is no longer human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Are you my enemy? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter. It isa highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximatelythe same energy output as ten G type stars. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This side of the wormhole is not stable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker's easy going manner and sense of humour isfascinating to me. I believe it to be one reason he is so popular amongthe crew. It may also be partly responsible for his success in mattersof love. There may be a correlation between humour and sex. The needfor more research is clearly indicated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only with long term exposure, sir. There is no immediate threat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because you are my child. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults. It was notmeant as a serious disparagement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the Legarans are ready to beamaboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. Thetiming will be crucial. Geordi must correctly interpret our intentions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The wormhole appears to have been a local phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is alsofrom the Lornakclan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the shuttle is entering the corona. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not concern yourself, Inspector. Youhave enough on your mind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Confirmed. The phenomenon does not have a definable centre orouter edge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The asteroid's internal structure is highly unstable. Any attemptto cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing fourteenthousand rads. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Both the Intrepid and Romulan logs show a series of distresssignals from Khitomer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To whom are you referring? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The number of systems now being affected bythe nodes has increased considerably. Sensors, engines, replicators,propulsion, they are all working together now, almost independently ofthe main computer. And the nodes link them all through the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It depicts something that feels familiar, sir. And dangerous. ButI have no idea what it represents. And that is all. Except for animpression of this being a Doctor Soong's work area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is not my fault. They told me I was notsupposed to be up here. They should not have done that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we can isolate something unique to the Odin survivors, perhapsan element not otherwise found on Angel One, we can utilise theEnterprise scanners. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading human life forms. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did, buthis wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with whatwould be best for her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And was the sole member of the committee to oppose my entrance onthe grounds that I was not a sentient being. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Friendly insults and jibes, another form of human speechthat I am attempting to master, in this case with the help of CommanderGeordi La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been exploring the possibility ofusing a tractor beam to pull the Raman from the atmosphere. However,the high level of interference prevents a positive lock. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When Worf's shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantumfissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break in thebarriers between quantum realties. Worf was thrown into a state ofquantum flux. He immediately shifted into other realities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would estimate four billion, three hundred seventy five millionPICARD <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Pakled ship has a shield up, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that the Cardassians were specifically interestedin capturing Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A gift from you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready, sir. Temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees. Minus two hundred degrees, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The laser blasts seemed to end when theyelling stopped. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: After relieving Lieutenant La Forge, Icomputed the length of time the border outpost <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reconfigure hydrogen plasma mixture to include thirty percentnitrium. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed? But surely, sir <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true, Doctor, but what would you want me to say? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pulse frequency out of pre-fire chamber reads steady. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor. Thedealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show thehighest hand, you control the next bet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening 19thcentury Earth. I investigated, and was inadvertently pulled into theirtemporal vortex. When I saw your photograph in the newspaper, I assumedyou had joined me from the future, from the Enterprise. I knew yourspecies was long-lived, but I did not realise you had visited Earth solong ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engines activated, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are welcome, sir. If I can be of further assistance <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The cruisers' weapons are powered up but sir, the Rekag ships areturning and heading out of sensor range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engage phasers and target. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating emergency landing procedures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then why did you never attempt to contact me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An excellent steed, sir. Sorry to disturb you, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we examine the memory subsystem next. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon. If the opticaltransducer were modified, we might be able to generate a hypersonicpulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have located the Phoenix, sir. We will intercept it intwenty two minutes. Captain's log, stardate 44431.7. We haveestablished communication with Captain Maxwell, and he has agreed tocome on board. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, Rhomboid Dronegar sector would put us at considerabledistance from Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have not been able to isolate the problem, sir. I might make amistake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When the effect hits, the forcefields will align, opening a cleanstraight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, Imust add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if theProfessor was right, I will need a twenty seven second countdown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakleddemand or not. We can either use force or not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She has not complained of any discomfort. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it was pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, without communication, we should beam upimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have scanned the entire Prytt communications system. Thisappears to be the primary access module for the central government. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may use mine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fully, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion no longer registers on our instruments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The source of the distress signal appears to be coming from upthere, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The good Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. It is not possible <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is it, Commander. It is programmed toaccept only authorised voice command. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is conceivable, sir, but it would requirealtering the pathway from the root command <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, display progress of genetic re-sequencing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is fortunate that I am able to perform my duties withoutemotional distractions. If that were not the case, a sudden coursecorrection toward the Neutral Zone would make me very nervous. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolising bothwater and air, and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes. Ibelieve she is amphibian, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shall I set course for Darwin Station? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise history. Aberrant behavior. Medical cross reference, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was looking for Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but I have no form of legal tender. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Guinan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not a thing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have its call sign now, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I disagree, Commander. After studying the design of thisstructure, I have determined that our best route of escape would be theunderground exit to the east of this wing. I have disconnected certainsecurity scanners to assist us. I am afraid we cannot permit you towarn your guards. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If that is true, he must be trying to reach her now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am programming the comm. system to scan the interferencepatterns, but a full analysis will take time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: About that, sir. Did the Doctor believe I was boasting? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, your original hypothesis is correct. Iconian is the parent tongue of a language family which consists ofIccobar, Dewan and Dinasian. I have constructed a basic workingunderstanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother,father, child, home, tribe, food, life, death, yours, ours, mine <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The choice of meal is determined by individual taste. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dancing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None of these people are emitting life signs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shall we begin? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have the coordinates, Chief O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Riker. Message from Starfleet, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The third planet of the Alpha Onias system. Our reports list itas presently uninhabited. Perhaps reports were incorrect, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. Am I intruding? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I recommend we use a gravitron polarimeter. It will perform asimilar function. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increase anyon emissions to six thousand particles per second anddecontaminate this area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, reading another open access panel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are moving into a course parallel to our own, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will take time, sir. Downloading this into our system willrequire fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate the alien'scomputer system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors report the Hood isclosing on an intercept course at high warp. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is she all right, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarmrelays, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In several cases, an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slowthe progress of metal parasites. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will be back for him later. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This experiment may hold the key to something I have sought allmy life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: After analysing the sensor logs of theBrittain and the Enterprise, as well as the data from the last seriesof probes, I conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupturein space, into which energy is absorbed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He would not move to a polar orbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will join you in a moment, Geordi. Data out. Lieutenant LaForge requires my assistance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My name. It is pronounced Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She already has access to the sum of human knowledge from me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. She is also beginning to show signs of the illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fortunately, we have more evidence. We were able to determinethat these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any knownTarchannen life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. If you wish, sir. But I ask if you'd take it asincontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise, one to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will signal for immediate beam out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The train has returned to normal, sir. Our destination is NewVertiform City. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show that the ship is still intact. However, sixty fivepercent of it is contained within the asteroid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I encountered a minor difficulty, Counsellor,but it has been dealt with. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unchanged, sir. They appear to be making no attempt to stop us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilogramsof ore in the Yridian hold. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You're becoming agitated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But our mission <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it was Lieutenant Barclay. He appeared to be partiallytransformed into an arachnid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And perhaps our library files as well, sir. That level ofinformation would be necessary in order to create a true adversary forme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And if they are not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I have studied the philosophies of virtually everyknown acting master. I find myself attracted to Stanislavsky, Adler,Garnav. Proponents of an acting technique known as the Method. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Any answer would be mere speculation. This is yet another exampleof how our actions have random results. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is the subject? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot be sure, sir, but I believe Manheim has developed amethod for harnessing energy from the pulsar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I require a low intensity magnetic field core. I believe the ironmass of the anvil will provide that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sustained. I will draw my own conclusions, if you do not mind. Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. There is a twelve percentdecomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links. Thatsuggests the alloys are vulnerable to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The wave has been growing in size as well as power. There isinsufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reachesLemma Two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We should begin decontamination immediately. Run an internalsensor sweep for locations of all chroniton fields on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I can assist you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. We should speak to Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is me. I am here. I am alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, may I speak to you alone? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Isolate all remaining command functions and accept related ordersand inquiries from main Bridge only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. But I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Half-Betazoid. Her father was human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energy reserves are dropping rapidly, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo'scurrent whereabouts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is at your mercy? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have located the Jenolen, sir. It is impacted on the surface ofthe sphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. There is far too little debris toaccount for an entire shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need muchpractice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Holmes collected nothing, neither trinkets nor thoughts, whichwere not specifically significant to him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, positronic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two million seven hundred thousand light years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotionsare within my grasp. Perhaps I will experience other emotions as timegoes by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising. Iam having difficulty establishing a pattern lock. Boostthe confinement beam, please. Pattern lock established. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant. However, that approachwould require much more time than our original plan. At least sevenweeks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently, that is not correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the entity was caught in the ship's circuitry. The Captainmight try to get in the same way if he's in trouble. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do bear a resemblance to Doctor Noonian Soong, thecyberneticist who constructed me. But, Doctor Soong was killed shortlyafterward by the Crystalline Entity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will be entering the Turkana system ineleven minutes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I began by painting the image of theblacksmith. Then I painted the corridor. After that, the anvil, thehammer, and Doctor Soong's face. The thought then occurred to me that Ishould paint smoke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were heading for a medical facility. I was taking the boy'sbrother to Sickbay and <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Such a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays,science labs one, four, and sixteen, or any of the bridge sciencestations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've been most anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion,Mister Argyle. Do you believe he can be made to function? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am different. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry. I did not know, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-timecontinuum. Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragmentswe observed earlier. However, it is approximately one point two milliontimes asintense. I believe this may be the origin of the temporalfragmentation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On most, there are brief sections which may yield someinformation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in theuniverse. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realised I mightbe encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility existsthat I was no longer alone. For that reason, I. The exocomp hasreturned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know the Trieste. Too small, too slow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Funny. I have had great difficulty determining what funny is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe I have found somethingon the sphere which could be a communications device. There's anantenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south ofour present position. It is emitting low intensity subspace signals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly, as soon as my work here is completed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An excellent idea, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But he had destroyed his own reputation by making what seemedwild promises about his positronic brain design, almost all of whichfailed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One kilometre forty six metres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best forher from what would be best for me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I appreciate your seeking other options, sir. Your decision couldhave been unilateral. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe is no longer transmitting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, we are too far below the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you believe that I lured the Entity here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore, I must deactivate you now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The condition is identical, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I formally refuse to undergo your procedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yeah, me too, boss. I'd love to take a gander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimatelyfail. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is 'Stars and Stripes Forever'. sir, by John Phillip Sousa, apopular American composer of band music in the early twentieth century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is Lal, my daughter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop. Stop. Stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I have analysed the residue from the explosions. This is ofno known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There does appear to be a recurring motif. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: but I have no sexual desire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should restore thebarriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their ownrealities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Freeze programme. Thank you, sir. I plan to study theperformances of Olivier, Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Babble, sir? I'm not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may bethat from time to time I have considerable information to communicate,and you may question the way I organise it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hostile's velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall Iput them on the main viewer? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Human interpersonal relationships are more complex. Yourexperiences may not have adequately prepared you. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An accurate description of humans, sir. You are over ninety percent water surrounded by a flexible container. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The wave has been disrupted, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is correct, sir. I am detecting large amounts of ultritium. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of theStargazer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructiveforce. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: High level gamma radiation would kill them, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If Counsellor Troi's supposition is correct,a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce themto reverse course, disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us toescape. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The drilling process has raised thetemperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degreesCelsius. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us toenter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What was your response? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in thecentre of its body. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Describe, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tetryon emissions continue to increase. Therupture is still expanding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I question your sincerity, Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. We will keep searching, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My understanding of the human brain suggests that the process isthe same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. If youwant to retrieve it, you simply access the proper sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intriguing. It describes the Empire as being highly advanced andpowerful, and capable of actually moving stars. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is why I must attempt this, sir. I have observed that inmost species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves. Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were to be damaged ordestroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successfulwith the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand therisk, sir. and I am prepared to accept the responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bring us around to the back side of the asteroid, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will use extreme caution. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please come with me, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I have configured these instruments to display informationwith greater speed and efficiency than stations used by the others. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is adequate oxygen for life support, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did I say something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I have completed the adjustments on the interface. I am nowwaiting for Commander Riker to finish moving the probe. Do you need tobe comforted? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He's only dazed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant D'Sora just gave me what could be considered a verypassionate kiss in the torpedo bay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. 1 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then the proper course of action would be to release hydrogeninto the rift, and hope that they have a substance that will detonateit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Absolutely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There they are again, Watson. I dare say we have caught up rathernicely with our quarry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No regrets. That is a human expression. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing. I willlearn them all. Computer, show me gestural language designation M nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, the difference in intensity indicates thatthis one did not originate from the same location as the first. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Evidently. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel, sir. Thedimensions this one occupies allows them to be, well, to be in severalplaces at once. But they consider this entire star cluster to betheirs. It was probablyunwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area. Ofcourse, there are three thousand four other planets inthis star cluster in which we could have colonised. The largest andclosest <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. We no longer have the power to reproduce complexelements in the replicator. We must find a way to generate a violentenergy release without using conventional means. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Several possibilities suggest themselves. I may represent anentire race of artificial lifeforms. If so, there may be a home planetfor others of my kind. A shared history and a culture of which I am notpresently aware. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. The Talarians employ a subspace proximitydetonator. It is not detectable by our scans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your friendship with me was part of the deception, was it not? You misled me at each step, and yet I was completely unaware. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, a conflict has started between theplanetary evolution team and the stellar physicists. Each wishes to bethe first to use the thermal imaging array. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Further energy emissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are clear. We are out of the void. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sixteen seconds to impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Target vehicle. We will be within tractor beam range in twoseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will take some time to locate them, sir. They are onundesignated manoeuvres in the Pheben system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a good guess. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could move the beam, sir. However, it may initiate the collapseof the surrounding supports. I recommend you and Geordi return to theship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency. Perhaps we should examine the phase buffers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The energy readings appear to be originating approximately twometres below the surface. I believe they are concentrated within thisburial site. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors,sir. A reversal of vowel and consonant, Barc to Broc. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To someone, somewhere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no police record. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beacon is falling astern, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you examine your life, do you find you have missed yourhumanity? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Except that Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leaderbecomes an honoured guest. Not us, not second in command, him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I think I know what the Captain's talking about. If I'm notmistaken, he's describing a paradox. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The total mass of the moon would remain the same, Commander, andthe impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over aneven wider area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forced spectrum communications are spotty at best, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterpriseshuttlebay two, prepare for docking, level oneprecautions for incoming material remain in effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. Perhaps it is my name. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so. I have proven to be vulnerable. At the presenttime, my deductions should be treated with scepticism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I not behaving as a solicitous mate? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are within two kilometres of the magmapocket. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have reviewed and stored five distinct signinglanguages. Here is an example of the first. This is blue. This is ablue ocean. This is a blue ocean at sunset. This is two people walkingalong the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is two happy people inlove walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is twopeople <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Who in this case sail the galaxy in search of mercantile andterritorial opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an unmapped system of six planets, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree Geordi. But the data matrix within the capsule does notcorrespond to any standard format. All we have been able to determineis that the device contains a chemically based system for molecularenergy encoding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It appears we will be able to transport to the surfacesooner than anticipated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was in your service record. Awarded first prize tap and jazzcompetition, Saint Louis Academy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this is a life form. Not to allow it to developnaturally would deny us the opportunity to study it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can I get you something? A beverage? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal has a positronic brain one very similarto my own. I began programming it at the cybernetics conference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Open a channel. This is Lieutenant Commander Data of theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markingswe discovered are consistent with this hypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Salia of Daled Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would like to join the game. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This would not appear to be routine. I was able to trace thesource of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulanintelligence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid the prisoner has eluded us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will feel nothing at all. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The object's enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetricinterference. That might have prevented our sensors from detecting itbefore we dropped out of warp. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They say you will be doing this manually,sir. No automation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. This has never been seen before. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship is intact, sir, with no indication of structural damage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am perfectly comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tracking power from secondary systems. No surges to any of thetransporters indicated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the shuttle has been launched. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I bet ten. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To be precise, Commander, you ordered me toreach the Neutral Zone before it is too late. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spindle, a thin rounded tapering rod <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be pleased to escort you around the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We may never know what happens. If they succeed, we will not evenrealise that these events occurred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasinglydifficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. Theprobability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. Icame to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself downand start again. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You continually question my orders in front of the crew. I do notbelieve this is appropriate behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading powerfluctuations on all decks. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a programming malfunction. Thecomputer refuses to identify the exits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I began with simple conditioned response exercises and followedwith environmental enhancement. Next I plan to explore bioconditioningdevices. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I believe that within six hours we could generate aconcentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the Tyken's rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Admiral, when I created Lal, it was in the hope that someday shewould choose to enter the Academy and become a member of Starfleet. Iwanted to give something back in return for all Starfleet has given me. I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give herup. I cannot. It would violate every lesson I have learned about humanparenting. I have brought a new life into this world, and it is myduty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these first difficult stepsto maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be acontributing member of society. No one can relieve me from thatobligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am her father. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Activating the remote sensors. Initiating interface now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear that this container was constructed of a materialwhich absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Please access all Starfleet Command orders to starships, starbases andcolonies for the past six months. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours sevenminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All systems are functioning within normal specifications, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An impulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is you who are not real, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have noticed, however, that you appear a bit uncomfortableyourself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starship separation in six, five, four, three, two, one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have an idea. If we take the shipto the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a transmission emanating from within thesystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the exocomps do not shut down after I have programmed them, wemay assume they are willing to go. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That the Ferengi are, well, the best description may be traders. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus shouldwork on non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are eachde-evolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds. I feel I mustinform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with your personal log was clever. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the last three hours and eight minutes, Ihave spoken to fifty six colonists. Ten of those refused to believe athreat exists. Twenty two favour staying and fighting the Sheliak. Sixteen prefer negotiation or <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Disengaging safety systems. Going to fulltolerance levels, now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The entity has disengaged, sir. Power levels are returning tonormal, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are ventingdrive plasma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is no longer a question of stopping it, sir. The explosion hasalready occurred. The fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference. Readings are still inconclusive, however the moon's atmosphere iscapable of supporting life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I am their friend. Should I not stand with them in a time ofdifficulty? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we narrow the search parameters to the biological database, itmight increase the chances of the computer finding a match. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away fromthe edge of the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inform me when you are ready. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around thefourth planet in the system. However, the receiving station is on thethird planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan CentralInformation net. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. Initiating dream programme. Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To what are you referring? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship matches the Starfleet description of a Lysian destroyer. A short range attack vessel with disruptor style weapons, and astandard crew of fifty three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousandkilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicateit could be the remains of a Federation escape pod. Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted aCardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captorand was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassianspace. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It seems your quarters have reverted to their earlier state ofdisorder. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Irrelevant, sir. Even if he restarts his engine now, he will nothave enough thrust to escape impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to the terms of the Klingon-Federation Treaty, Koralhas every right to free transit through Federation space. We cannotboard or search his vessel without cause. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will begin immediately, sir. Is that all? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have much to offer a potential mate. However, wecannot grow old together because I will not grow old. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are many fascinating records of Menthar battle strategy. They were exceptionally innovative. In fact, they were the first to usethe Kavis Teke elusive manoeuvre as well as the passive lure stratagemthat is comparable to Napoleon's <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then here you die. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Open, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emissions now at thirty pulses per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Watson, we are about to have guests. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A magnetic storage bay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian theology. It seems that Ardracame to Ventax Two and promised one thousand years of peace andprosperity, for a price. Upon her return, she would enslave the entirepopulation. In Ventaxian culture, it is considered bad luck to speakher name out loud. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a system of roads on this planet, which indicates ahighly industrialised civilisation. But where there should be citiesthere are only great rips in the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am your friend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On what do you base that assumption? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse ishaving an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pleasant dreams, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: There were no errors, Geordi. The variance must be no more thanpoint zero six terawatts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it is Vandor Four, a planetoid in ellipticalorbit around the binary system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Step back, please. I believe I have found it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And at this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids acollision with the first. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the rate the rupture is expanding, we will soon be in dangerof hull breach. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. I will call up the results I have achieved this far foryou to study. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ice man? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A second ship has joined the attack on the Bortas. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What kind of receiver would be capable of processing thesesignals? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organise myfiles. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do not seem happy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ejection systems offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When I play poker with my shipmates, it often appears to be auseful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity. I wascurious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact inthis setting. So far, it has proved most illuminating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Welcome back, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a steam locomotive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitriousfilament I mentioned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This procedure will only increase the conversion level by pointeight percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you require assistance? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a lie. Another lie. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. I estimate that this scene consists of portions of sevendistinct holodeck programs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading. It appears to be aneutrino emission with no visible source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at this time, sir. There is insufficient evidence to do so. In order to determine whether or not a rift will form, region must beexposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greaterthan that normally generated by a starship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I have no memory of you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That cannot be possible. I have a memory record for that periodof time. I can recall a series of images. I saw Doctor Soong. Myfather. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed onto the kittens. I do not know why. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are not responding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died. Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life formswithin the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one weobserved in Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Six seconds to impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore, by anyaccepted standard, it does not exist, yet being within it denies thatconclusion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Will this be enough? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant Barclay being referred toclandestinely as a vegetable? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am ready to access the main power grid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Watson. Not a dead end at all. Hello, what's this? Can yousee the scratches? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of amalfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree. But based on the size of the rift, it should give ussufficient time to complete the rescue. Computer, initiate nacellefield saturation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It is difficult to localize. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The colony we just planted, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, he is reading as fully human. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My thoughts are not for Tasha, but for myself. I keep thinkinghow empty it will feel without her presence. Did I miss the point? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a reasonable conclusion. Borg technology has given eachmember of their society the ability to interface and functioncollectively. It is likely they have constructed their ship with thesame philosophy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ninety seconds remaining. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And firing not on the new space station, but on the Bandi andtheir city. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I have offended. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Source? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I do not suppose I will ever really know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise to USS Yamato. Respond, please. USS Enterprisecalling USS Yamato. Respond, please, on this frequency. No response,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But what if it does, Counsellor? What if it turns out that thoseare the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not makeme a bad person? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will arrive within transporter range in three minutes twentyone seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why have you suspended the game? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eleven dead, eight more unaccounted for, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, it appears the energy output <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiate shuttle preflight sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inertial guidance shows one point four parsecs travelled,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was created on a planet <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With this power drain, we may have troublecommunicating with the Enterprise, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a reasonable explanation to your query, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All of which you will learn more about when the Captain hasapproved your being on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: From any particular point of view, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed my self diagnostic, and have confirmed that Iwas not aboard the Enterprise for ninety minutes seventeen secondsyesterday afternoon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of earlyprimate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were motionless for three minutes eleven seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Replay at time index one four four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Clemens? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two,prepare for docking. Level one precautions remain in effect. Shuttlehas cleared the Jovis cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, it is good to see you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The modifications that you have made to the torpedo's guidancesystems are remarkable, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. A systematicsurvey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Doctor, but they do have superior experience. During theirservice, they have interfaced with every part of the station core,something none of us has done, including yourself. They may haveanother way to control the particle surge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have incorporated a micro-replication system into the devicein order to fashion tools. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In my study of interpersonal dynamics, I have found that conflictfollowed by emotional release often strengthens the connection betweentwo people. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can initiate a brief, high intensity warp pulse from ourcurrent position. We should be able to attain sufficient velocity toenter the rift, beam the crew off the Fleming and exit without usingour warp engines. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence,Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I am forced to attempt escape. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was only trying to carry out his wishes. I just wanted to keepmy promise to him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Howdy, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acceptable or not, sir, it is the truth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Velocity is one hundred thirty five metres per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have computed a possibility, Commander. Since even deep spacecontains trace gases, sir, a vessel in the Picard manoeuvre might seemto disappear, but our sensors could locate any sudden compression ofthose gases. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eighteen hours, seven minutes, and ten seconds, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, are you seeing the image of your mother? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Away team reporting in, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have less than three minutes left. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming into sensor range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With impulse engines operating at sixty percent power, it willtake one minute and forty seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By robbing her of her memories? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no question about it, sir. It is hissignal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the child is the source of the unusual radiation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, not from our present orbit. The array is currentlydirected away from us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will also see the bet. Seven. A possible straight for CommanderRiker. Jack. Still no help for the Klingon. Eight. Nine for the dealer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have much to learn. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Warp core to ninety percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanning sensors) <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We discovered two instances of unexplained coma on Nel Threewhile the Ullians were there, but Tarmin was not part of the group. Further examination revealed that only one Ullian was present at allincidents of coma. Jev. Captain's log, stardate 45435.8. Doctor Crusher andCommander Riker regained consciousness while we were en route to theUllian home world. The slow process of their recovery has begun. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have completed the analysis of the parent's coursethrough this system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A rare anomaly named after Bela Tyken, the Melthusian captain whofirst encountered it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. We'll be returning to the beam-out point shortly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There appears to have been a malfunction in the holodeck'sdatabase retrievalprogramme. The two programs somehow temporarily linked together. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tachyon signatures will not last long. By the time the fleetis deployed, it will be too late. Begin to reconfigure the sensors todetect ionised particle traces. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that Icould also taste my dessert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, we are out of range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It appears to be a smaller, less developed version ofthe original creature. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Comic, continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Life support systems are also functioning at low levels. Thereare approximately four hundred fifty Ferengi on board. That is astandard complement for a ship of that class. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, anyone who is willing to transport in this manner, wouldsuffer significant internal damage that could be detected. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. However, theoretically, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, but the computer can replicate such an instrument. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensor readings show it to be a small class-nine vessel, probablyan interplanetary cargo ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Startling. Quite extraordinary, in fact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Entity is beginning to resonate. Vibrations areincreasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin is unique. Inthat case, I am alone. We have accessed the information storage area. Considerable damage has been done to the files themselves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could say home sweet home, sir, if I understood how the wordsweet applies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Four days, eleven hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first indication occurred when we were digging. I saw herperform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. We have approximately fifty two metresremaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a maincorridor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I will need a few minutes to attend to a personalmatter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time. Thearbitration will continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: More power, we risk losing life supportsystems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With regard to romantic relationships, there is no real me. I amdrawing upon various cultural and literary sources to help define myrole. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamicprocesses inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest this evening for asmall audience. I would like for you to attend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Power couplings severed in forward phaser banks. Attempting tobypass. Controls not responding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Consider, Captain, this programme has entered an alien data base,ours, and in less than seven hours has managed to not only learn oursystems, but has begun to reprogram our computer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please respond. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Faster. Move to maximum speed. DATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, that chaos when we were studying it in the lab must havebeen the energy surge of a reproductive cycle. It is now a colony of single cells which organize as a computer. Andlike any computer <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computers were also affected, which would indicate the phenomenonwas not an illusion butoccurred in real time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A former crewman was born here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To some degree. Doctor Soong hoped to provide me with an amalgamof the colonists' memories. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved,I am mainly conducting research into <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I knew we had to have the Captain's physical pattern here, sir. He was the last one to beam out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I will leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And since we do not know it's intent, I recommend we go to RedAlert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Poker? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are concerned, of course, Captain, but confident. Do you notsee that, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will raise you three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The metallurgical scan. Have you completed it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At this rate of acceleration, fifteen minutes forty seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it would. During the last hour, I have conducted asystematic review of the entire Romulan subspace grid. I have comparedmy findings with the specifications of your own transmission array. They appear to be compatible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do you think it is going to be? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute now being served aboardstarships. It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of alcohol, butthe intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is now within twenty thousand kilometres of theEnterprise and closing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the current cannot be off downfrom this relay box. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Adjusting the synchronic distortion. Point zero zero one. Pointzero zero two. Point zero zero three. Point zero zero four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was found twenty metres in that direction, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is happening, Father? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was unable to prevent it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have observed that the selection of food is often influenced bythe mood of the person ordering. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ihave several examples of Commander Riker's battle technique. At theAcademy, he calculated a sensory blind spot on a Tholian vessel and hidwithin it during a battle simulation. And as a lieutenant aboard thePotemkin, his solution to a crisis was to shut down all power, and hangover a planet's magnetic poles, thus confusing his opponent's sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. It appears to be a scanner. Possibly a transmitter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the Pentharan spheral forecasts are correct, ten to twelvedegrees Celsius within the first ten days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is projecting an energy field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion. And it isexpanding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, but triolic activity is increasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hooey? Ah, as in hogwash, malarky, jive. An intentionalfabrication. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Clemens, it is imperative that we continue our mission. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The fragment's course has been altered by one point two onedegrees, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A friend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no life readings, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there are four warbirds holding position on the Romulanside of the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How do you know when something is funny? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are a fine debater, sir. It is a pity you have used yourverbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your owngreed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Estimate intercept in three minutes. Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. While en route tothe Endicor system, we have encountered a Federation shuttlecraft,which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There are no indicationsof where it came from or how it got out here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I hope we are. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But pain is unpleasant, is it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I would ask that you not require me to be more specific. I assure you, I have a good reason for asking. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. Perhaps it is scanning us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to the instruments, sir, our speed never exceeded warpone point five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can think of no motive for such a pretense. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Insufficient information, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: From alcohol? That is not possible for me, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My childhood? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could you describe feeling angry without referring to otherfeelings? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have determined that the storage cube from John Doe's escapepod contains navigational information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Good afternoon. I would like to speak to Guinan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the Hera is on the surface, its hull could not possiblywithstand the pressure of the atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifteen thousand two hundred fifty three, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are badly damaged, sir. Their life support systems arefailing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You sent for me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I must ask you to stop using the exocomps. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twelve hours sixteen minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we have arrived at Tanuga Four. The away team hascompleted its survey of Doctor Apgar's work and is ready to return tothe ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To affect all iterative branch points inthe <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The running youth was a ploy. The real crime is here. And theintended victim is that man. Mister Jabez Wilson, employee of the RedHeaded League, dupe of a gang of criminals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing sir. Nothing at all. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: South America. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. Sensors show she's in the midst of agroup of Mintakans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf, please report to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblerscaught up in a web of crime, corruption and deceit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I have been analysing the nucleonic beam. I believe itwould be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in away that would disrupt the signal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibility, sir. An unexplained power fluctuation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This will take some time, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Would you care to sit down? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Captain's log, stardate 45350.3. We have arrived atPenthara Four and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastationcaused by the asteroid impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There was no evidence to suggest sabotage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Purpose? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand how these new fields have formed. Notransporter beam has been active in any of those areas. I cannot seethat they have anything in common. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep mehere. The Enterprise is certain to find me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. On my way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is the planet our probe detected in the T-taurisystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find her to be a competent officer. Highly motivated, thoughsomewhat lacking in her understanding of the theory underlying thedilithium matrix application. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The acoustics in Ten Forward are most favourable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see. So the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning inzero gravity environment, coupled with the adverse effect it would haveon the psychological well being of the average human male, is whatmakes this anecdote so amusing. Yes. Very humorous indeed. Hysterical,in fact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The nucleonic beam has ceased, Commander. The probe has shutdown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are initiating visual contact, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The explosive was a triceron derivative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reduced to the mere facts of the events. The substance, theflavour of the moment, could be lost. Take games of chance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I think you should be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed, there are many races that are not empathicallydetectable. The Breen, the Ferengi, the <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless theshield emitter is active. Any attempt to sabotage the device would haveto be made while the shield was in operation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is irreversible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have I said something to upset you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no reason to accede to Mister Fajo's wishes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. But no longer. Through joining they have been healed. Griefhas been transmuted to joy. Loneliness to belonging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Bring allsystems online and direct full power to the shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumardisappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed, Captain? I know many more interesting anecdotes, sir. Forexample, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The control mechanism's not operative, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This contradicts everything we know about holodeck physics. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Main coupling is matching navigationalinputs, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eightyseven million years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Disengage modified beams. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand your dilemma. I once had what could be considered acrisis of the spirit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Is something wrong, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And are located near the system J twofive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly they were simply curious. Explorers like ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is alive. What appeared in the form of Captain Rice is anintelligence gathering device used during the Ersalrope Wars. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Objects appear approximately five hundred times their normalsize. As you can see, the cellular damage is quite extensive. However,based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity, I do notbelieve it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Timothy, your head movements are counterproductive. Can you bestill? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Pardon me. I am searching for two individuals with anophidian. A snake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have used a verbal contraction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanatingfrom the same location. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do withmedical crosschecks? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We believe the parasites came through the ship's hull after wedestroyed the asteroid near Tessen Three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Anger is a negative emotion. I wanted to concentrate on somethingmore positive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And how is that accomplished? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am having difficulty scanning the object. It appears to beapproximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We should also consider the advantages of further examination ofthe Borg and their vessel, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She knows me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suspected you would attempt to operate the interface alone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are many possible explanations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A wide variety of items. The replicator can make anything youdesire. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not your concern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Geordi, I am still confused by Chief O'Brien's reaction thismorning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the moment, I am looking for a common event or experience thatGia, Garvin and Skoran might have shared that could have a causalrelationship to their illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanicsand exobiology. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correction, sir, that's blown out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escapepod. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zerohundred hours, it will activate the fire suppression system, whichwould seal off this entire compartment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am a Frenchman. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, may I ask your advice in a personal matter? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But those qualities would interfere with rational judgment, wouldthey not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. It is not possible for me to be injured in thatfashion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her beliefs should be reflected as well. However their death rituals are quite complicated. RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly, Wesley. I realised for the first time it was possible tocontinue Doctor Soong's work. My initial transfers produced veryencouraging results, so I brought Lal's brain back with me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Termination of all life support in fiveseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Array is still transmitting data, sir, but it is no longersending that information to the Federation. It appears someone hasredirected its imaging systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. Intriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no technology to block telepathic transmissions, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering withbioreadings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Request permission to accompany you, sir. I am totally versed inthe genre of the period. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was I seen leaving? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am at a loss, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our present speed, we will arrive at theAtalia system in thirty seven hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not appear so. Computer, has anyone been in my quartersin the last twelve hours other than Commander La Forge and myself? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to away team. Please respond. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Male, between twenty and thirty years old. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You'll find this most intriguing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since there is no intelligent life, the question is by what? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is another temporal disturbancedirectly behind us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unable to transfer control, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, six is a valid point. Of course, now the objective isto roll a duplicate six before hitting seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I've recommended such a course, butthere are several wounded people and Doctor Crusher <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, this will take slightly more time than we have, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have found the quantum flux in Worf's cellular extends tothe subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. In essence,Captain, Mister Worf does not belong in our universe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we take it to Engineering and run a completecircuit-pathway diagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Key universal translator, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Compensating, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was on the Bridge at my station. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I am capable of performing significant tasks both mental andphysical. Perhaps your hotel would offer me a job. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How can that be, if the interface circuitry is burned out? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The energy signature would seem to indicate a phaser-like blast. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The reading I received is from behind thisdoor, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The number of the cards and their values remain quite constant. What would be the purpose in counting them? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not necessarily true, Grandpa. I do have an off button,if you will. Its activation robs me of my consciousness, thereforerendering me dead for all intents and purposes. It is not something Ienjoy contemplating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With their pants? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cold feet? Jitters. A nervous reaction to an impending event ofgreat importance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, I will be there shortly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal is realising she is not the same as other children. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But, Geordi, your Starfleet specialty is antimatter power,dilithium regulators <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bridge, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. No need to beam me up,sir. The situation is under control. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There do seem to be some variations on the quantum level. She canuse contractions. I cannot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Captain's log, stardate 45351.9. Doctor Moseley hasmet with the colony leaders, who all agree they are willing to take therisk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, resume normal illumination. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed modifications, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew. A warp core breach moves at a much faster rate. The motion of the cloudis within my visual detection threshold. At its current expansion rate,it will consume the Enterprise in approximately nine hours, seventeenminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. My brother has made that possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, number four shield has failed. Increasing power to number three shield to compensate. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, run transformational matrix calculations. Matchnavigational referents to known stars in this sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At their current speed, sir, the entities will intercept us inten minutes, thirty one seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then let me offer an alternative. Transport me to the station, Iwill attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be a most noble cause, Q. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The drag coefficient continues to increase. Our velocity has fallen by twelve percent. Velocity is increasing. Ship's speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An accident in Engineering shut down my cognitive functions for ashort period of time, yet I seemed to remain conscious. I saw myfather. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you be more specific? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have found them to be quite unsettling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Wright has effectively fused the incongruities of thesurrealists with the irrationality of Dadaism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am conducting diagnostic <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shield has severed the beam, sir. Captain, the energy field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we maintain our current speed, two hours, twenty threeminutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You lived with the colonists? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot allow that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, all systems are back under helm control. The computerhas returned to normal functioning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, a human proverb! As in folklore, or an historical allusion,or tribal memories <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. It is as if he originates from adifferent quantum universe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. Do you read me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Early bird? I believe Commander Shelby erred. There is noevidence of avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on Jouret Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will reach the class M planet in approximately eleven hours,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, atmospheric dissipation hasaccelerated over the past several hours. I estimate the planet'satmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, it indicates a synchronic distortion in the areasemanating <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no handholds in the rock face. We are going to have tojump. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this end of the wormhole iscurrently stable, but the other end apparently shifts positionsperiodically. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Does the Admiral have children? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To begin the first illumination test. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximatelyfour point three five six solar masses. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision. I will try. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is time for the wedding rehearsal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How were you able to accomplish the repair soquickly? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. It isprobable our mortality failsafe has been overridden. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In seventeen hours their hull degradation will reach dangerouslevels. They will have to leave before that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As far as I can determine, sir, very little. There are fourcolonies in theBoradis system, as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout thesector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Slang, sir. I did use it correctly, did I not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter symphony in C major, Bach'sBrandenburg Concerto number three, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, secondmovement, molto vivace and La Donna e Mobile from Verdi's Rigoletto. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will surrender yourself to the authorities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are slowing too, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have analysed the imaging logs. It appearsthe Array was reprogrammed to observe several Federation sites. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When Counsellor Troi is unhappy, she usually eats somethingchocolate. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish. Jenna. Are we no longer a couple? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A resumption of our present course at warp six will place us inthe T'lli Beta system in six days, thirteen hours, forty seven minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I to infer that you intend to keep me captive? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Romulans have released a high energy burst. The net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometresaround the Sutherland. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You and I are real, sir, as is Lieutenant Barclay. We entered theholodeck together when we first went to see Moriarty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is the exact number there should be. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In theory it could operate over several light years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You did ask me to be thorough. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is, but I can tellyou what it is not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At current rate of acceleration, the shuttle will be destroyed intwenty eight seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip. CommanderRiker has speculated that it may be a Romulan transmission. I amattempting to track its source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could attempt to remodulate the tricorder's delta-bandemissions. It should be possible to better control the temporalaperture. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you should return to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have bypassed the primary system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There have been reports of warp bubbles and other subspacedeformations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a problem with the engines? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears Counsellor was correct. Pierce was partiallytelepathic. His maternal grandmother was born on Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the wave's power signature is fluctuating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have notbeen damaged by our landing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be a considerable risk, sir, but it would also representa gesture of trust on our part. It could be an important step towardpeace, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And at the moment it is all pure speculation. He has done nothingto subject the Enterprise to danger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But this is almost as if the laser drillseemed to operate itself with a will <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spot does not respond to verbal commands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not believe you have the authority to promote me tothe rank of Admiral. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> DATA: But should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who hasdied? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have studied much human literature on the subject of love andromantic liaisons. There are many role models for me to emulate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That may be impossible, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The waves are even more intense within the rift. I estimate hershields will fail in approximately twelve hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is often the case that children learn languages more easilythan adults. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor. Dealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show thehighest hand, you control the next bet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rupture has expanded another four point two percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would explain why your music composition programme beganplaying The Slavonic Dances. I have been analysing the collected worksof Antonin Dvorak. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. We speak often. It is a young female, humanoid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pressure wave harmonics dispersing. Temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beam is scanning the shield's perimeter. The probe isemitting an unusual particle stream. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you suggesting that there is some value in losing? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bearing three one-six mark four twoDATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, and it still may, in a limited fashion not detectable by ourlong range sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am trained in evasive manoeuvres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am programmed with the procedures you mention, sir. And in anymeaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis ofcomparison. I am the only model available, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This will need a completely new field induction subprocessor. Itappears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The orders were given with great subtlety. To use an aphorism,Starfleet's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reversing tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. Captain, I believe we should decontaminate this roombefore getting underway. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Casualties reported on deck twelve. Sickbay responding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But the Elway Theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate. Allresearch was abandoned by the mid-twenty third century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is the source? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. The debris consists primarily of duraniumand polycomposite fragments which suggest a ship. Furthermore, thefield contains sufficient mass to account for the Fleming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do not share her affection? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe that statement to be inaccurate, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course, but <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe we have changed direction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not have enough information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do not have a staff. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Oh, I do not feel envy. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Five months, fourteen days, eleven hours, two minutes <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have encountered the numeral three an inordinate number oftimes over the last two hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The computer has completed its analysis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And you must solve it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Primarily as Doctor Watson, you will keep a written record ofeverything I say and do. For later publication. And the famous Holmesviolin. He purchased this in a pawn shop in Tottenham Court Road forfifty five shillings, which he considered to be a very good investment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I have found that humans often use small talk duringawkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for thatpurpose. How did I do? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I will have to analyse these readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And I will perform a self-diagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It isgoing to be okay. I will count to three. One two three.  DATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ambassador Spock, may I ask a personal question? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The pattern has no exact match in Federation records, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It should be interesting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unable to make a precise measurement. However I wouldestimate impact within ninety seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello, Spot. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are obviously still aboard. Another Starfleet vessel must besent to intercept the Enterprise at Bynaus. They might be taking theship to their home planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. Then to burn the midnight oil implies late work? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why did you do that? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters. power levels rising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was very thoughtful of him. I've been debating whether ornot to initiate another dream sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I wish your work on the particle fountain hadbeen more successful. Perhaps the exocomps will help you to reconstructit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am picking up molecular displacementtraces. That suggests movement through this area during the last tenhours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Marr, Raymond. Called Renny. Yes. I do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is nothing wrong with the transporter. I have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields will be down in eighteen seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Modifications are complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where is your automobile now? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have voiced certain reservations to me about his abilities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Look, Sarjenka, there is your home. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Many aspects of this situation are puzzling to me. I have beenstudying various texts on the subject of marriage, but I have not founda suitable guide. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Their phasers, sir, set on kill. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They do not seem to be functioning at all, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to the Barzan probe, we should be in the Gamma Quadrantbut these readings clearly indicate we are nearlytwo hundred light years away in sector three five five six of the DeltaQuadrant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that what is known as a poker face? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could berelated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Still no readings, no sign of anything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our destination is the Beta Stromgren system,following the path of the Vega Nine probe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It started after Doctor Crusher ordered the scanner to magnify. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could you please continue the petty bickering? I find it mostintriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain. Geordi, please return power to thecontrol console in this room. I wish to reactivate theprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would be happier in another job. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At times, I too find it difficult to share my thoughts withothers. I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in amanner which humans can comprehend. But do I know that <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And what about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. I amconsidered to be alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, are you implying the exocomp exhibited some form ofself-preservation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors indicate the communication originated from aterawatt source on the planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are six life forms aboard the freighter, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radiation levels dropping back to normal, Captain. Energypatterns are breaking down, sir. The radiation signature is no longerstable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What about the weapons? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is the Federation Starship Enterprise. You are ordered tostand down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may retain the surplus for yourself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engage secondary tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We always come back to the human equation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was aware of that. But are you aware that Tyrellia is one ofseven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able todownload this old style disk drive back to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twentythree hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does not bother me. In fact, I am happy to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, what are your intentions toward my daughter? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. We have a visual record. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It adjusted to my tactics. It tracked with me, anticipating. Afixed programmecould not have done that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently, their ship is apparently quite fragile. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ow. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I detest hypocrisy. I wish they would just come out and admit it! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so. The message reads, my revenge is athand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sleigh ride? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of the difficulties. Please bring the phasers backonline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go to science station two on the main Bridge. Use a lateralsensor array to get a more precise reading. I will modify an anyonemitter to eliminate the fields once they've been isolated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The phaser pulse appears to have been carefullyattenuated for just that effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonicstress levels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am increasing the input now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is traveling at warp seven point six. Mass two pointfive million metric tons. Configuration, cubical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire ship's complement is twohundred and thirty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increase the power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have not made our intentions clear. We areinvestigating <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot permit this to continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I will teach you to recognise the artistry in paintings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe he means television, sir. That particular form ofentertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Human nature, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, sir. Perhaps it was my admirationfor Grandpa that got the best of me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent whenhis first child was born. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. The rear wall. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two cases of Iresine syndrome on Hurada Three, at exactly thetime Tarmin and his group was there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium composition with a frozenhelium core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With pleasure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet Command believes the Lysians are using a new weaponwhich has shifted the balance of power to their favour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which ismanaged by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the shipmany of the characteristics of a biological organism. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Given what is now happening to our ship, sir, their weapons couldbe vastly superior to ours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The test ship has successfully entered warp, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no records of any blame against you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Undecided, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin samples from yourfather. They showed improvement, so I administered this to him. He isnow recovering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I will work on staying within myself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading a small pocket of vegetativelife. A primitive lichen growing in a fossilised seabed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have tried other stimuli, but they have been unsuccessful. Iunderstand your objections, but it is my life and I have a right torisk it if I choose. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid that is not possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The act or the emotion? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, is this poker? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. First I must isolate the cause of the illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We've lostDATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Completely, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I said, that is one of them, is it not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands,where the pheromones are produced. I believe I can activate thepheromones with a bioactivant solution. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no defence, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may have inadvertently given Professor Moriarty the means ofgaining control of the real Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have noticed, Grandpa, that you keep repeating the same notesof a musical phrase I am unfamiliar with. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have reached the centre, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have commented on the lack of senior officers available forthis mission. I believe my twenty six years of Starfleet servicequalifies me for such a post. However, if you do not believe the timehas arrived for an android to command a starship, perhaps I shouldaddress myself to improving my <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Commander, but removing any of these people againsttheir will would be a violation of several Starfleet regulations, notthe least of which would be the Prime Directive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have an engine failure warning in the <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must decline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Right one metre. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gold. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Guinan! Excuse me. I must speak to youimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture toactivate. I suggest we avoid exposing it to any <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead. LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It connected them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your was also found on the message control module. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has restrictions. The information from Geordi's visor is socomplex it is difficult to encode. Therefore the signal breaks downeasily. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, but the firing programme was dynamic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inquiry. The word snoop? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exocomps are highly sophisticated devices, sir. If they performup to expectation, their potential to advance this project isconsiderable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not laughing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a question, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only time, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Permission granted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. Outposts. The planet below was possibly one ofthem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I request you reject me as arbitrator. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you are referring to the rescue of Maid Marian fromNottingham Castle? Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All sections secure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Or the oligarchy on Atifs Four, whichrequire a young <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I realise that, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary ship is heading toward thesecoordinates in the Hyralan Sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, subspace radio is out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Particle accelerators at full power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Warp five, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The binary message left by the Captain is notentirely clear. He seemed to be concerned about the phase differentialof our photon torpedoes. That firing them might produce catastrophiceffects. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will find Moriarty this way, sir. The warehouse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Prime Minister is hailing us. Priority one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Monitors are functioning normally again. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you wish to apologise, I am prepared to listen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, if it were possible to lock onto the object, it mightrematerialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the metaphasicprojection matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At warp one, in three days, four hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is death? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will the Enterprise need to follow thetest vehicle? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am reading an open panel. K twelve, J nine,deck thirty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is of sufficient size and density to causeplanetwide damage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, I cannot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: While suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed toFauvism, this quite inappropriately attempts tojuxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso and Leger. Inaddition, the use of colour suggests a haphazardmélange of clashing styles. Furthermore, the unsettling overtones ofproto-Vulcan influences <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The computer has configured the drilling pattern and specifieddepths. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have encountered one thousand, seven hundred fifty fournon-human races during my tenure with Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How was the seminar? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is this structure? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostaticenergy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we couldcreate a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise theparticles. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Maintaining field integrity will be difficult, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, that is true. But I never wanted to compound oneillusion with another. It might be real to Q, perhaps even you, sir. But it would not be so to me. Was it not one of the Captain's favouriteauthors who wrote, This above all, to thine own self be true? Sorry,Commander, I must decline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without our shields, at this range there is a high degree ofprobability that a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. I have experimented with producing vibrations incrystals by means of graviton pulses. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. Placental barrier, maternal antibodies and amnioticfluids all serve as a filtration system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My memory core and neural nets are self-contained. I would befine, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment toalleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was not manual override. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. You have exceeded my abilities. I do not object, but I do notunderstand how this hasoccurred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly thatthreatened the Enterprise. It is possible that they triggered a safetydevice which caused the ship to avoid destruction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has a follicle, sir. Live cells. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would not have thought it possible, sir. I am eager to test thesuccess of our efforts. It doesremain to be seen if the Romulans will accept us. Captain, you haveseemed unusually pensive since we received the news of AmbassadorSarek's death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Access your data bank on sexuality, level two. That will definethe parameters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It should not be. It is a harmless lambda field generator. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you for your concern. I will be fine. And thankyou, for everything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to. I have been studying the Krocton segment, asyou asked, and have selected an appropriate site for our transport. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently there were no starships available on Starbase One FiveThree. The envoy is aboard a class eight probe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationshipinvolved. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledge the signal. Ensign, lay in the course and engage atwarp nine point three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted, sir, wassomehow distorted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption duringthat time period. My internal chronometer and the ship's computer areboth perfectly synchronised. There does not appear to be a temporaldiscrepancy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are very strange looking creatures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have often wished to be human. I study people carefully inorder to more closely approximate human behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To what effect, sir? We are faced with an impossible conundrum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we are to investigate, sir, we must get closer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Standing by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are cause for concern. However, I still have Counsellor Troiand Captain Picard. The odds are that at least one of the procedureswill be successful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. I believe I will stay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Uxbridge house is coming into transporter range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do you feel, Lal? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Stubbs, your own actions have provided evidence to thecontrary. When you destroyed the nanites in the core, they responded byinterfering with our life support systems. It is difficult to acceptthese as random actions by machines with loose screws. In effect, youmay have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA:  <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Running frequency search. Negative, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Quite amusing, Doctor Hawking. You see, Sir Isaac, the jokedepends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature ofspace-time. If two non-inertial reference frames are in relative motionNEWTON <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Similar in specifications and capabilities, but a variation inmarkings and hailing language. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have many human friends. I would be pleased to count you amongthem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly. But as you may recall on several occasions, we havewitnessed the Borg removing key circuits from injured comrades, nodoubt separating them from the group consciousness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Has studied, sir. Every case. As Holmes would've pointed out,during the time in question, something was afoot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So you believe the wedding will still proceed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It offers a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans areaccustomed to. However, it would still appear to be the better choice. Do you disagree, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you injured her? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I will delete the appropriate programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net. I willneed to do further testing before I proceed. Someone will come and takeyou back to your cell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Warp one point five, sir, which is what my instruments have readall along. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is where Mogh's alleged transmission should be. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for astarship to enter. It is possible the Pegasus drifted into theasteroid's gravitational field and was pulled down into one of thefissures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am certain that you could. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently, he did not survive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have the same safeguards as the ship's computer. Therefore, Imust report any inquiry regarding restricted information to theCaptain. Your reaction suggests you do not wish the Captain to beinformed of your inquiry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Both. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. They are withdrawing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you really think it is possible? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Faith? Then you do believe Kahless may have supernaturalattributes? As an android, I am unable to acceptthat which cannot be proven through rational means. I would appreciatehearing your insights on this matter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And that is the first and most important aspect of anyrelationship. Counsellor, it took me only moments to learn signlanguage. It will take them months. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No sign of a wound. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All of the ship's records are available to you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Miranda's first encounter with other human beings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We areventing drive plasma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Priority One. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ensign, scan for Starfleet combadge signals. Is Commander Rikeraboard that ship? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am initiating a subspace scan to search fortemporal anomalies on or off the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not like it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All the probe's systems are functioning perfectly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to localise it. It is Cargo bay four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe we can make the necessary modifications in mainEngineering, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely twelveminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have it, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe this is an information storage device. A crudeanalogue of our isolinear optical chip. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not directly, no. But you did question me about the diplomaticcapabilities of both Captain Picard and Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be unethical to take pleasure from another being'sdeath. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I should re-align the ship's clock with Starbase four ten'ssubspace signal to adjust for the time distortion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Many of its components have been removed. Apparently LieutenantRiker used them to keep the station's radiation shield operational. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you never told her the truth? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Begin night watch. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps, Doctor, but there is no known method for controlling aneutron migration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears we are being probed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We may not have to. Direct your view to the far corner, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have been considering the problem of the missing ship. Although there is no record of a launch to the Ficus sector, whichwould not be unusual considering the chaos of the early twenty secondcentury, someone had to load that ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. Computer, access the exocomp's sensor logs. Confirm thatthere was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelvehours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. I took advanced training in the operation of auxiliaryspace vessels at Starfleet Academy, where Ireceived <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is built into my positronic decompiler. Itwill be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with thesame anaphasic signature as the one we found on Ned Quint's body. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is my conclusion as well, Commander. Two shuttlecraft,staggered between the Enterprise and the Raman, with their shieldsadjusted to refocus the tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Crystalline Entity is moving away, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Set course three five zero mark two one five and engageat warp eight point five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Denver's standard crew complement is twenty three, but they were transporting five hundred seventeen colonists to the Beloti sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unidentified ship heading toward us. Two life forms are aboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering. Is Engineering your destinationas well? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Intrepid was the first ship on the scene, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Careful, Commander, they're much strongerthan <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It happened just a few moments ago, in my arms. Ira Graves isdead. Captain's log, supplemental. I leave Gravesworldwith an empty feeling and the knowledge that our mission wasunsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about tounlock have been lost forever. Our immediate priority is to reach thenearest starbase so that Graves' assistant can get on with her life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. But I believe Commander Riker wanted us to letthem escape. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then the initial encounter was solely for the purpose ofgathering information. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A change in energy readings, sir. I am reading an internalbuildup of gamma particles in <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Borg aspire to the perfection my Brother and I represent. Fully artificial life forms. We are their future. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most of these are ordinary G-type stars. This would appear to bea neutron star, possibly a pulsar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He needs assembling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems. Hull breaches on decks seventeen and thirty six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will verify it. Just as I thought. It is a Starfleet subspacedistress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulationframe collapsed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What kind of cake are you eating? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. It is a stalemate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are scanning us, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are out of the void, sir. You may stop auto-destruct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And who, precisely, is us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seenothers around me age. Until now it has been theoretically possible thatI would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might findthis attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I amartificial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They refuse to accept further reports from you, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Another weapon has been launched, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would explain the mysterious chroniton fields RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The moon's altitude is fifty five thousand kilometres. Projectedorbit is circular. There is no further danger to the planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Matter valves are open and operating. Magnetic containment ofantimatter pods is constant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I was playing only for a standoff, a draw. While Kolrami wasdedicated to winning, I was able to pass up obvious avenues ofadvancement and settle for a balance. Theoretically, I should be ableto challenge him indefinitely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. You are concerned about unintentionallyhurting Ensign Tyler's feelings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no human life signs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It indicates a genetically engineered biological life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, the twenty ninth is the only one I cannot bypass. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi? Is Counsellor Troi with you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I never found it to be necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. For Commander Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesisis in error. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I successfully planted a command into theBorg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe itwas time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate all of their systems are armed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individualsand locations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will attempt to do so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, we do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may find it aesthetically displeasing, sir. I could just filea computer report on that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, reset Borg simulation to time index two point one. Increase Borg strength by twenty percent. Runprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a Code Forty Seven, sir. Starfleet emergency frequency. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will also need to communicate with the Enterprise in sectortwo thirteen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We downloaded the Yamato log, and contained in the log was theprogramme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Comic, I wish to know what is funny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have made visual contact. There are lifeforms here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ship's computer is accepting navigational inputs from theshuttle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf, if the situation is under control, pleasereport to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will require my hand. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, there is evidence of residualbitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the Entity'sattack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The unhatched eggs of a large scaleless <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm attemptin to neutralise your pain receptors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend toward a more egalitariansociety is partly responsible, eh? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering to Captain. If the antimatter is released,the ship will be destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. We've been able to verify that thesecoils are the logs of the Promellian captain, but most of them havedecayed and cannot be repaired. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come, Watson. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not as such. However, even among humans, friendship is sometimesless an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two othertachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly. The other two pulses havethe exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse. It is as if allthree originated from the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a passenger liner which mostly travelled Earth's AtlanticOcean during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inconclusive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty sevenmillion strands of energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly, but I will need to know the exact frequency and Icannot determine the risk to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, exit! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If your theory is correct, the Cardassians may be planning anattack somewhere in this sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reconfigure photon torpedo warhead yields. Set for high energyburst level six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eleven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle sustained a direct impact. Venting driveplasma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is holding. Shearing force, eighty metric tons permetre. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They aredesigned to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns. Once they arein place, I will destroy the existing brain cells. We'll see if theartificial neural network is able to take over your cognitivefunctions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I still see nothing unusual. Perhaps we should activate it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The away team signal's been cut off, Captain. We've lost contactwith our people. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are being hailed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. This is the only way. The safest way to proceed is forme to cross alone. The heat and toxic gases have less effect on me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you get one the way I did, Lore, it will mean four years atthe Academy, another three as ensign, ten or twelve on varied spaceduty in the lieutenant grades. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history, onceit has elapsed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you believe it to be the right decision for them to marry? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, two hours later, when it was aboard the Enterprise andno longer in danger, it repaired itself. I believe the exocomp wasprotecting itself. And if that is true, it has demonstrated anawareness of its environment, and an ability to adapt to thatenvironment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would not be advisable. You must cease your descent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Juarez child? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has beenaltered by the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The cards have been favouring the Lieutenant, but that is theresult of random chance, therefore, a temporary condition. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The entities offer no indication that theyare aware of the string fragment, Captain. Their course and speedremain constant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms percubic centimetre. As a result, when it passes Moab Four, it will causetectonic shifts well beyond eight point seven on the Richter Scale. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Bortas has lost her port shields, sir. Itis unlikely they will withstand another hit at that quarter. Theirprimary life support has failed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard regrets detaining you, but it will be necessaryfor a while longer. In addition, I require access to your ship'scomputer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I will have to follow the rules of conduct for a Ventaxianjurist. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at all. Because we do not hear the doctor's footfalls, wemust assume that she is being carried. And since we do not hear hercries for help, we know that she is gagged. Further both sets offootfalls are heavy and masculine. One man seems to shuffle and stumblein an irregular pattern. Since the ground is level, we must concludethat Doctor Pulaski is struggling against one of her captor,sporadically knocking him off stride. Deduction, pure and simple. well,not that simple. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibilitythat I may in some way be the causal factor. However, since you havehad a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of thesickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what wenormally think of as self-identity. Their ability to abstract is highlyunusual. They seem to communicate through narrative imagery byreference to the individuals and places which appear in theirmytho-historical accounts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Marr, do you wish to change the frequency? Doctor Marr? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Romulan ship is hailing thealien using their equivalent of linguacode. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energising, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I expressed no such interest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do not be apprehensive. Wes. I found the Academy examinationsquite elementary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is best that I do not remember. I trust I did nothingunbecoming to a Starfleet officer? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain that either human or Bajoran rites are fitting,and I have researched the funerary customs of over five thousandcultures to no avail. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Lieutenant. You seem to have lost the will tocommunicate with others. You have friends here. We, we care about you. Why, just recently, Geordi, Wesley and I were saying <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, I am reading anomalous variationsin the molecular structure of these memory chips. Please confirm. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship's energy is being drained into the fissure before we canutilise it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed, sir. I'm on my way. Data out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In order to do so, we would need to tie the ship's subspace fieldcoils into the transporter system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. It lost its cohesion as soon as thetransporter cycle was complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently, the putative malfunctions were carefully programmedinto their ship's computer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have invited you here to meet someone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without further analysis of your condition from Counsellor Troior Doctor Crusher, I cannot say. But I believe it is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it is an emergent property. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did you find our deception pleasing? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The master criminal. The man Holmes could only defeat at the costof his own life at Reichenbach Falls. Our adversary, my dear Watson, isnone other than Professor Moriarty himself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex. It is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only one race uses that device, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At your service, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The planet was used as an outpost for the Debrune approximatelytwo thousand years ago. The Federation's Archaeological survey hascatalogued numerous ruins on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have verified receipt of the access codes for the Lantree,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must leave immediately, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The servo mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate humanmovements. I did not realize the effect was so distracting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion anddirect it to a specific time and place. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The planet is subject to frequent sandstorms. Footprints mighthave been obliterated prior to your arrival. Doctor Crusher and I willbegin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these withsome known life form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I wouldfind this entire procedure insulting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate an increased level of baryon particles in thecabin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But no one has actually seen one? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently such a dump began, was then halted, and thecontainment seals were dropped. There was still sufficient antimatterpresent to lead to an explosion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It worked well, sir. We have successfullyreseeded the ozone layer. But for their atmosphere to maintain it'sintegrity, they can never use the shield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sure he meant now. So, you need time to get into uniform. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shuttle has cleared the bay door. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then the conductor then signalled for the train to changedirections, and at approximately the same time <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will enter the sun's photosphere in threeminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have always felt that it was done hurriedly, but I know littlemore. Here, sir. This is where the cruiser's landing party found thesignal device that had led them here. And they found me lying there,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundredmetres wide. We would need to cross-connect six units and align them sothe fields overlap. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will function sufficiently to stop Lore, Doctor <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All is quiet so far. Of course, no oneknew we were coming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Freeze. Computer, search for the term Tanagra. All databases. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did whut? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Angel One is a class M planet, sir, supporting carbon based floraand fauna, sparsely populated with intelligent life forms. It issimilar in technological development to mid-twentieth century Earth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Whatever you wish, dear. There we are. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Containment fields to flight tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, may I see you in the ready room? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The word excuses implies ulterior motives for a conflict. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, how is it that the Q can handle time and space so well, andus so badly? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. Although Commander La Forge and I designedthe chip, Mister Crusher derived the equation governing its operation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in manycultures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nagilum? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am merely stating a fact, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please come to Engineering immediately. It is urgent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much valueto possessing me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspacecommunications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When Tyken was trapped in the rift, his analysis determined thata massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly. Fortunately, his cargo included anicium and yurium, which he used todetonate the explosion. He then escaped through the ruptured centre ofthe rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scout ship has just beamed someone off theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have followed all of Starfleet regulations to the best of myability. I expected they would be pleased. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were knocked unconscious by the fall. You broke a bone inyour arm, but Doctor Crusher repaired it. Everything is fine. Captain's log, supplemental. The infusion of plasmainto the core of Atrea Four has been accomplished. The core shouldremain molten for several hundred years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite. It isunlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent. Hisbrain is much smaller, sir. I do not believe he can comprehend ourlanguage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am proceeding to the lab, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not from this distance, sir. I am also detecting an ion trailintersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet typesix shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I busted him up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But there is a problem here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently so, sir. My neural nets are still fully operational. You may begin by opening the ventral access panel located twocentimetres beneath my right ear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduledobservations, additional processing time will be required. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am curious. Do you still think the real Kahless will returnsomeday? Or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisiswhich originally sent you to Boreth? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, when I first awoke from my nightmare, there was a briefmoment when I <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The rupture is eighty six percentclosed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. The body Geordi discovered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not a ship of war. It is a ship of exploration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And fifty seven seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Hull stress has returned tonormal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are out of order. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your gut? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can access the power grid here. I will attempt to depolarisethe grid by using a low frequency inversion field. It may disengage thenodes without destroying them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is it the mercenary ship? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in allits forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to livingbeings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be acceptable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are already at seventy five percent of tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. After an eight point three second burst from the dish,we'll discharge all taps through the phasers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have we met before? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. I'm an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will not submit to the procedure, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do know who I am. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite, which isinterfering with our scanners. I am also detecting traces of kephneum,a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being. It is likelythe asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Blame you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Light the torches to let them know that I am back. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please continue with record scan. Intriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was my experience as well. I simply felt angry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I should not have interfered. It would be best if I apologised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Botanists. Originally from the aquatic city New Martim Vaz inEarth's Atlantic Ocean. Residents of the Rana Four colony for fiveyears. You, ma'am, are eighty two years of age and a composer of Taoclassical music. You, sir, are eighty five years of age and aspecialist in symbiotic plant life. You have been married for fiftythree years. I memorised the colony register on the way to Rana Four,in the event that such information would be needed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were in a space module. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it could take more than two hours to reach the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That could make socialisation more difficult. A human male. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise to Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have simulated several such fields, but were unable toreproduce the same drag coefficient. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, Commander Riker's injury was not accidental. Certainvines on the planet evidently seek out warm-blooded beings anddeliberately infect them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would also not be an atypical Romulan ploy, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Yar? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards have been sufficientlyrandomised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And will we also discuss, Lore, which of us was constructed first? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sarjenka? Wait! I'm Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would seem to be superstition. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have observed that humans often base their judgments on what isreferred to as instinct or intuition. Because I am a machine, I lackthat particular ability. However it may be possible that I have insightinto other machines that humans lack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor, but if I may make a supposition, I do not believehis message was intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course ofaction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a most lethal weapon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dying from what, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. My brother's positronic brain has a type L phasediscriminating amplifier. Mine is a type R. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Alors, nous sommes presque frères. Je suis heureux de vousconnaitre. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Puzzling. How can anything be too efficient? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Whatever it is, it could be what they are covering up, and thereason someone killed Malencon. Captain's log, supplemental. On my order, Data'sstartling discovery of a possible life form has been beamed aboard sothat its true nature might be uncovered. But unlike life on Earth andelsewhere, it appears to be completely inorganic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you were going to go through yourself, sir, that is notpossible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To avoid deceiving oneself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely,given the time frame. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Commander, as Acting First Officer, I must questionyour decision to accompany the away team. If Captain Picard were here <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of the tactical situation, Lieutenant. Let them go. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you must decide which is your greater obligation. Yourloyalty to Sarek or your duty to the Federation. Can you accept thelogic of continuing this mission? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, identify exit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The colony's aqueduct system is functioningnormally, as are the communication relays. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Klingon vessel has recloaked, sir. I haveno readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ishara. What are you doing? The fusion generator is overloading. You are attempting to disable the defence system. For what reason? Wehave rescued the crewmen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unable to locate any malfunction. All systems are operatingaccording to your design specifications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. That is a particularly spellbinding subject. Inmost stars, the rare Earth element europium is enriched relative tosamarium and gadolinium <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we can determine the cause of these geological disturbances,we might be able to reverse the process. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The creature is now in direct contact with the hull, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They could penetrate the molecular fabric of my hand-coveringinto my nerve circuitry, and interface with my verbal programs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservationis shared by most life forms? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The saucer module is now entering orbit with us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twenty nine hours, sir. Projecting it somewhere on the westerncontinent. Thatwould destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was my fault. I am responsible for their deaths. In myarrogance I thought no one could possibly harm the great Riva. I amsuch a fool. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You want to know if I had some special technique? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Phase alignment is stabilised. However, sensor efficiency hasincreased by only an additional one point three percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationshipbetween anti-time and normal time is analogous to the relationshipbetween antimatter and normal matter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Music, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Basic early design. Capable of sub-light travel only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No question of it, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To which dinner was the Captain referring, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, begin random fluctuation of shield frequency andmodulation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because you failed in your task? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scan shows no debris within that radius. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the Doctor means is that humans enter what is known asREM sleep. Rapid eye movement. It is the level ofbrain wave activity at which one dreams. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Iconia? I was on Iconia, now I am on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must reiterate, it would be better if Iwent alone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot be hurt. But she can. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where is Doctor Pulaski? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My internal chronometer was supposed to wake me thirty fiveminutes ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You're certain the Captain approved this,Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emergency signal reads as follows. Enterprise to divert tocoordinates four-two-three by one one two by five one immediately. Further orders forthcoming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Both matters are subjects of protracted discussion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. I will try that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know of no one who said that, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not aware of Regulation six point five seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no memory of events during that period. When we arefinished here, I will perform a self-diagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For what, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If Endar respects Talarian custom, he may have to. According totheir tradition, a male child of fourteen has reached the age ofdecision. He then undergoes a ceremony of initiation, after which hehas the freedom to make his own choices. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So you wiped my memory processors after this childhood. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In orbit of Quadra Sigma Three, sir. Ready to beam downrescue team to underground emergency area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, afluctuation of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you have visual contact? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. I find it interesting how much importance humans place oncelebrating the day of their birth. A day they cannot possiblyremember. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I advise against the use of phasers, sir. The gas buildup is toogreat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Add to it an attack by a nonexistent Romulan vessel. It doessuggest an interesting question. Was our away team actually over there? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of theface, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am already listed in several bio-mechanical texts, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could you postpone our departure for just five minutes, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be an information module. With a holographicinterface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is, in essence, an eruption of anti-time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no scarring on the planet surface that would denoteheavy construction of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were a bit rude to me. Might make you feel better if you saidyou were sorry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Federation vessels have encountered Tamarian ships seven timesover the past one hundred years. Each meeting went without incident,however formal relations were not established because communication wasnot possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The by-product of an energy source employed by very few speciesbecause of its deleterious effect on living tissue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Both epicentres are beneath the two southernmost drill sites,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. Our understanding of Romulan technology is stilllimited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am seeking advice in how <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. It is very expressive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering hasbeen abandoned. There is no one there to fix the problem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Judging from the residual temporal fluctuations, I believe theyhave returned to their own time continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spot? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you requested, I will now remind you of the reasons youdecided to end your relationship with Jeff. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growthactually occurring in module L seven three? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The genetic information must have been incorporated into theearliest lifeforms on these planets, and then passed down through eachgeneration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ishara is willing to have the implantremoved, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually sir, that may be an incorrect analogy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I hope Doctor Crusher was able to help you with your headache. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It has disappeared once again, sir. I believe it may have beencoming to a halt. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, Worf is entering the fissure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The most probable explanation is that the glass came into contactwith an unshielded power source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an inventor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Should we not rerun it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is a synaptic map of the humanneo-cortex. This is a cross section of my positronic net. And this is aschematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believesome sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is stillrelatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusuallydense. The Enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is idiotic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would you care to deal, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Give it to me or I will take it by force. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twenty six minutes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid ship's records do not concur. Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not necessarily meaningless, Commander. The Klingons regardhonour above all else. If the crew of the Enterprise-C had diedfighting for the survival of a Klingon outpost, it would be considereda meaningful act of honour by the Klingon Empire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Considering the rate at which you imbibe, sir, is your lineage atall mixed with human? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could have you confined to quarters for the duration of themission. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet the Sheliak andthe Federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet Sheliakdomain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a rangeof less than three thousand metres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. May I ask a personal favour? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, very good, Lal. You have correctly processed the sense oftouch. There are many fascinating experiences I wish to share with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The only sites not been attacked were on Calder Two, YadallaPrime, and Draken Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two,prepare for docking. Level one precautions remain in effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point where all the ideas and instincts of thisemerging intelligence are first expressed in some form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been testing the aphorism, 'a watched pot never boils'. Ihave boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times. Insome cases, I have ignored the kettle. In others, I have watched itintently. In every instance, the waterreaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one point seven seconds. It would appear that I am not capable of perceiving time anydifferently than my internal chronometer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately two hundred thousand years, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. They appear to be quasi-energy microbes thatexist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears that your hypothesis was correct, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forty-one seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your service record to date suggests that you would perform thatfunction adequately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed, I. Cannot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with aunique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changedthrough any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no prior memory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes and no. Like a time displacement, but it does not have adiscernible event horizon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect mefrom power surges. It would be possible for you to remove my cranialunit and take it with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since your action did not produce the desired results, the onlyadvisable solution should be to re-examine your decision makingprocess, and look for errors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One moment. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Ramsey is correct, Counsellor. The Odin was not astarship, which means her crew is not bound by the Prime Directive. Ifhe and the others wish to stay here, there is absolutely nothing we cando about it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Environmental systems fail to respond to command, Captain. Itappears the microbrain has successfully interfaced with our computers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have further information regarding the tornado that killedAmanda Rogers' parents. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are now within the distortion wave. Hull stresses haveexceeded maximum tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. But in those situations, you were acting as Head ofSecurity, not as First Officer. The primary role of the second incommand is to carry out the decisions of the Captain in this case, me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You suggested a plan that would work to your advantage, one thatI would be capable of executing. You then implied a reward. Clearly youwere <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And this is my attempt, with guidance from Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first incision is complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Considering the exceptionally long lifespan of Vulcans, it doesseem odd that Sarek and Spock did not choose to resolve thosedifferences in the time allowed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You sent for me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A subspace field coil with an isolated power source. Curious. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of anactual planet on the other side of the wormhole. We could survey thenearby stars for such a planet. It would require approximately sixdays, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You do understand, sir, that my interpretation of the symbolswill not be exact? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is you, Geordi. Includling the kiddillies, I'velearned six hundred sixty two jokes, and you have not <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why should I? This concerns me more than it does any of you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Precisely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. And, Commander, continue your work. When you areready, I will still be here. I find some of what you proposeintriguing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All propulsion systems are shut down. The ship is drifting, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You must hurry, Commander. The containment field has dropped tosixteen percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But he is more comfortable with me, sir. It is humanity he isfleeing. Sir, I can serve as an intermediary, a bridge back. A reminderof his obligations both to us and to Tin Man. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will have the report sent to you, sir. We are still on coursefor the Gariman sector. Our speed is warp six, thirteen hundredhours. Sickbay reported one minor injury in the exobiology departmentat zero four twenty hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The destroyer has minimal shields. Their disruptor capacityappears to be only two point one megajoules. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: While both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters, ourcrew locator sensed them passing here and here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Coordinates received, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shuttle's acceleration is increasing. Its trajectory ismoving directly into the planet's atmosphere. He will reach anatmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As well as our hydrogen collectors. Fond farewell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In much the same way deep sea divers experience nitrogennarcosis, you experienced a form of temporal narcosis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm detecting a chroniton field in your room. May I scan thearea? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I may not understand human humour, sir, but I am a StarfleetAcademy graduate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no other ships within three light years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a pattern? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What type of device is this? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My most recent self-diagnostic revealed no malfunctions. Perhapsthere is something wrong with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am planning a memorial servicefor Commander La Forge and Ensign Ro. I would like you to participate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As requested, Captain, library computer information on thisplanet. It has been charted only from long range scans. It is Class M,but shows no indications of life forms, sentient or otherwise. However,you may find this of interest. Resolving it into our language. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Music? I do not hear anything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Subterranean caverns to the east, sir. Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And a trail, which is so well marked, that obviously we are meantto follow it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Triolic waves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. It is possible that those are memories of my childhood. Andof Mrs Soong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I think you had better see this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do. Thank you for making it clear to me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is the best place for us to start. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Obviously a class M world. Gravity and oxygen within our limits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps they were planning for the worst, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Good evening ladies and germs. I come from a town so small, we had a fractionfor a zip code. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at thistime, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The polarity is not compatible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, run fluidic sensor diagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, not yet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He will try to delay until a rescue attempt is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a bright side, Geordi. You will have me to talk to. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Will two hours be enough time to complete the high-resolutionseries on the neutron star? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have passed through the wave, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a virtual impossibility, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. Itappears to extend to the cellular level. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid soquickly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The primary plasma system does not indicate apower drain from any of the transporters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate, but Isee no reason to deny it. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is, of course, a genetic predisposition toward hostilityamong all Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Incidentally, Captain, the effects of the time distortions arenow being felt in the Ilecom system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And you conclude because of this that I am impartial. Hence, youaccept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry to disturb you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspacefield distortions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field. I am unable to scanwithin the vessels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What are we to look for, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Over here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not responding to ourhails. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, are you injured? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A celebration? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Proceeding immediately, sir. Data out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it was a repulsor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta,you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken,Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe's point of view reveals that theobjects exist entirely in two dimensions, on a single plane. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors at maximum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the starsystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Silence, Klingon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our readings show no evidence of any, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is exactly how it appeared. There was a mind working againstme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am incapable of forgetting. I will remember every detail of myvisit here with perfect clarity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe is moving with us, sir, holding relative position. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is conceivable, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe. I cannot have you confined to quarters for something you have not yet done. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as acarrier for ownone, thus disguising its origin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand your concerns. Request denied. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Captain and many of the crew are not yet convinced he istruly human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, please give us Klingon personnel appropriate to thisevent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probe has been launched. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a hypothesis that may explain that, Captain. I haveanalysed the recording Doctor Crusher made. Most of it is quiteordinary. One hundred fifty discussions about ship operations, twohundred fifty two conversations of a personal nature, five couplesengaged in romantic encounters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One is my name. The other is not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, if they activate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask a question, sir, of a personal nature? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weatherpatterns. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All systems seem functional, Captain. Everything is in perfectorder. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready to transport. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No life form reading, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we transfer twenty megajoules of energyfrom the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs, it should besufficient to activate the device. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that satisfactory? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two hours, forty minutes and three seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a matter of perspective, Doctor. In the strictest sense, Idid not win. + <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control anddefensive systems. We believe this is why the ship jumped to warp. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The alien who attacked me has vanished, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unable to answer that question, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have analysed the control module in theprimary weather control grid. It appears the station is experiencing asystem wide power failure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with thisexocomp in the past hour. I estimate it would take two people ninehours to complete the same tasks. I would characterise the unit'sperformance as excellent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am accessing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Vamoose, you little varmint. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are tracking the entity. It is approaching CaptainPicard's position. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most of our sensors would be ineffective, although ourdirectional array should cut through the interference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we just had one minute more, sir, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You objected to the fact that he seemed unwilling to set asidesufficient time for you. You said he was unresponsive, that he neverdid the little things. You disliked the sound he made when he ate hissoup. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly! The vial was placed in his hand after he died. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I was not informed of any change in the duty roster. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuinecuriosity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, I have often wishedfor the sense that humans call intuition or instinct. Since Vulcans areincapable of lying, I must accept the Ambassador's explanation as thetruth, but I would still prefer a gut feeling to back up thisconclusion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, ship's sensors detect an abnormalenergy reading in the Captain's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the Entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the sampleswe collected, a gamma radiation scan would reveal that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment withnon-relevant conversation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the language of the contract seems carefully chosen to avoidany loopholes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, servos off. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are within transporter range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aft. Outboard of the port nacelle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sure that will not be necessary, Captain. I am fully capableof running a circuit check on myself. It will immediately determine anyabnormalities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is highly unlikely. Rana Four possessed no interstellarspacecraft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Coordinates one four zero by two zero five, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scan of grid one five seven is complete. I ammoving to grid one five eight. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periodsyou described. Events in one time period would seem to have no effecton the other two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Step away from the forcefield. Your proximity is interfering withmy scan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps being human yourself, sir, you do not find them asintriguing as I. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We now know what is causing the bursts, and why the sciencestation exploded, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That one. RW nine six three two one, twentieth century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently there was a micro-fracture in the conduit wall. Thefault did not register on our instruments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the final manifest has beenreceived. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Darling, you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the first day wemet. I believe I am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of thegalaxy. Now, you relax. Put your feet up and I will take care ofeverything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Does that mean you no longer believe this is the real Kahless? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm afraid not. According to the Tkon use of galactic motionarystartime charts, after Bastu came Cimi, Xora, Makto <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is little information in the library computer other thanthe fact of its existence. Our sensor show no signs of life forms,virtually no vegetation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. That would not be ethical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know how much longer my vision would have continued hadI not been reactivated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. May I inquire how your investigation is proceeding? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical to the onefound in the cavern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you will find all of the missing items in the vessel,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Human? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, my Chorus was special. They allowed me to combine differentperceptions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Put the table over there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will go to deck twenty and begin modifications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we're here. Why not avail ourselves of this opportunityfor study? There is a giant protostar here in the process of forming. No other vessel has been out this far. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are in good hands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you do not believe I should pursue this any further. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Begin docking procedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The next distortion wave will impact infourteen seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That story is generally considered to be apocryphal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most unusual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid if I have another waking dream, I might injure him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Three. All threes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting life readings from the planet surface, aswell as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxideemissions, indicative of combustion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately twelve seconds, sir. Hull stresses one hundredtwenty percent above tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you think I am responsible? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am ready to depolarise the power grid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Downloading. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Impact in seventeen seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They have received the message, Captain, but are ignoring it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Expanding analysis parameters. Including Bayesian functions,broad EM and subspace spectrum polling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Closing on the new signal, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Constantly, my friend. Particularly the humour. A man goes to astore to buy some kidneys. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot identify the energy residual. However, it appears tohave the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observedfrom the weather control system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that important? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As the probe went into orbit around NelvanaThree, it began picking up low level subspace radio emissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Proverbial lemon? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Cardassian warship is moving on the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Father. Captain's log, Stardate 44091.1. We have been atStarbase four one six for three days. Young Willie Potts is respondingwell to treatment and has been returned to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible, sir. But absolutely no margin for error. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields have registered an impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Using the Potemkin's transport logs from the originalevacuation, Commander La Forge and I were able to modify thetransporters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. However, I would prefer to make certainthere are no anomalies in my neural net. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a malfunction? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, perform a narrow bandwidth analysis. Eliminate allnon-vocal waveform components. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your ship's design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict theexhaust flow. That coil is misaligned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I help you, Mister Remmick? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you lock on to the exocomps? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energy cell usage remains constant at one point oh fivemegajoules per second. Curious. The efficiency reading on the dischargecrystal is well above Starfleet specifications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Wesley, was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. It is normally occupied by Captain Picard, Commander Riker,and Counsellor Troi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface andhuman life signs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot reproduce your performance if I cannot see your feet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your sanity is not in question. However, your evaluation of theavailable information is biased. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Based on its present trajectory, the cometappears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Learningsign will be a part of their process of learning how to live togetherin peace. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The prototype has been towed into position,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe any of these items belong to you, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a manner of speaking. It is a crystalline composite ofsilicon, beryllium, Carbon seventy, and <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would also explain the failure of their warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spinning wheels? Accessing. A device for spinningyarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel andone spindle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, unauthorised access of turbolift five ondeck thirty four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in thequadrant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassiandefensive systems. Their ship is running with a high powered subspacefield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is anything wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps someone wanted to draw us into the conflict. RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The structure of the bulkhead has been altered on a subatomiclevel. The metal itself is in a state of quasi-molecular flux. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our flight path is changing. Right ten point seven degrees, sir. Insufficient to clear the photosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have not been entirely successful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reminded of a recent dream. This brace is reminiscent of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A human female. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I had no choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, the atmosphere becomes increasinglyturbulent the farther down you go. You may not be able to bring theRaman close enough to the Hera before being destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create anaccurate simulation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have expended considerable thought with respect to my apparentuniqueness among the crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So in a sense, they are learning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that not Pardek? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stop. You must not hurt my friends. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tasha exists in our memories as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to do so, but I am presently in need ofinformation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the Captain is now his separate self, sir. Much of whathappened is naturally missing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget theunpleasant ones? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That cannot be. The image I saw was of Doctor Soong as a youngman. I did not encounter him until much later in his life. Thereappears to be no rational explanation for my experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are currently attempting to isolate the corrupt circuitpathways. I reckon the process should take less then two hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Doctor, this is not ego. I am concerned about giving theCaptain unsound advice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Query. What have I forgotten? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is your painting representative of something? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that not what I said? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You sent for me, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Plasma inductors are not responding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Accessing. Chief O'Brien served under his command aboard theRutledge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Spot. Spot. Spot, down. Spot, down. Down. Spot. Down. This is down. Down is good. This is up. Up is no. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. The field is also acting as a tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Multiple hits, sir. Power failure in forward shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Welcome back, Captain. We were not expecting to see you on theBridge so soon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to the rate of reproduction, there should be a twelvecentimetre opening in the Klingon hull at this time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The centre of a huge space federation, a population of trillions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ten seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A Klingon male. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The life signs are very strong now, sir. They are coming fromover there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A force field was activated on the station afew moments ago. It is possible that Commander La Forge has establisheda low intensity deflector field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I amnot that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be completely accurate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker is correct. While the information imparted tocadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleetofficers, it nevertheless requires a significant period ofsupplementary systems training and situational disciplines. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are at ninety percent of tolerance. Mycalculations show you will reach one hundred percent of tolerancebefore you are in range of the Hera. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know my name. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Good for you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I doubt that statement is entirely accurate either, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gammascan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your empathic powers do not perceive anythingbecause as an android, I have no emotions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, may I make a personal inquiry? It concerns my poetryreading. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She would not have told you anything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time. Butthis would have to be done in the other two time periods as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I believe it would be prudent to return to theEnterprise. There are physicians on this planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown. I am attempting to analyse motion pattern. Results stillinconclusive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have cleared the shock wave. However, tetryon flux in the areais increasing rapidly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must say goodbye now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I accept your challenge, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at thepresent Edo stage of evolution. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid they would require the molecular structure of thebeverage in question. And, as you are no doubt aware, our knowledge ofyour planet is quite limited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Methinks I could not die anyplace so contented as in the King'scompany, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is why the ship's forward sensors did not detect theminitially. We were looking at them along their edge. There was nosurface to read. I will illustrate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The system automatically provides for self-correction, Captain. There has not been a systems-wide technological failure on a starshipin seventy nine years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe your plan is a bit premature. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One millisecondafter its detonation, thecomputer will trigger yourwarp jump. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There it is again. An area of blackness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, we have come this far. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. That will not be possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Desire? To long for, to crave, a wish, a request, a <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My positronic brain is not capable of generating thoseconditions. Goodbye. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting no signs of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have complete confidence in your ability to representmy interests. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard is not satisfied with KiMendrossen's assurances that the Ambassador is in good health. Do youconsider Sarek capable of carrying out his mission? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Set the pattern enhancers around whateverobject you wish to transport. I will proceed to the transporter roomand begin modifications. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, place a level three containment field around the warpcore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop hasformed in the transfer beam. I will have to go to the substation andattempt to correct the problem from there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The last Federation vessel to make contact was the Potemkin, sixyears ago. They were warned that anyone transporting down to the colonywould be killed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I would theorise that the Borg are somehowinterconnected through these slots and are working collectively. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you sure? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, much of my bodyframe is made up of tripolymers, a nonconductive material. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I did nothing. The problem seems to have corrected itself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading unusual subspace energy in your vicinity, similar towhat the probe sensor recorded the first time you encountered yourmother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, an unscheduled launch is taking place in Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, containment field down on deck thirtysix. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, it is more curiosity, sir. I doubt that they expect us toabide by their value systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And how did you get here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A happy ending. The mechanical man gets his wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the joke was not funny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than ourown warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When I realised the crew was incapacitated, I initiated emergencyproceduresDATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, the cave in which we hid was made of rock which containedheavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. We surmise that theEntity was unable to penetrate that barrier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may havecaused the comas, except for the Ullians. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My calculations indicate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do we do if they deny the existence of survivors? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Manipulate the synchronic distortion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, but there is nothing more uniquely human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The interlink sequencer is now bi-directional. It compensates forthe asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is not a speculation, Doctor. We are notwhere the Barzans said we should be, which would indicate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If there are indicators as to why this particular area hasremained intact, I cannot detect them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No anomalous readings were reported. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All vital signs returning to normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Timothy, accompany me, please. I want youto recall everything you heard people say aboard the Vico before it wasdestroyed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is my name. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: City block. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlikely. A problem with the replicator would have affected thecontents as well as the glass. But the liquid in the glass was asynthehol replication of a light ale of Earth origin, which is, Ibelieve what Lieutenant Duffy ordered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Just as I expected. I am fine. Could not be better. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency andamplitude, it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard, my interpretation of Ventaxian law suggests underthese circumstances, this is acceptable. Your objection is overruled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then in what way is it different? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I see it? This is one of the metal fragments I sold toSkoran. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Garvin is correct. You agreed on twenty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is Nuria the closest of the five? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately thirty seconds. I have scanned the entire ship anddetected no life-threatening injuries among the crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, there is a sixty percent chance you will not survive theprocedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that the purpose of existence? To care for someone? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then our investigation was worthwhile, sir. We have eliminatedboth the delegates and the ship's regular complement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excellent choice. I'll join you. Computer, two Calaman sherries. Would you care for some dinner as well? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Any further delay would put us all at grave risk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Personal Log, supplemental. CommanderMaddox, there are still many dynamics of social interaction which I donot understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All systems operating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasicsignatures from the organisms, which were symbolically represented inmy dreams by a high shriek. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, at that distance, the ship will not withstand the magneticfields and radiation. We will not survive. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Cardassian ships are changing course, sir. They are crossingthe border. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I must point out that the Ventaxians did have one thousandyears of peace and tranquility as promised by Ardra. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If so, we may have to call Security. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is the difference between knowledge and experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us withintransporter range, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps that would explain why our sensors did not detect him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you found the Academy challenging,Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They appear to be empty, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Noonien Soong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A most interesting occupation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am referring to the great detective's credo, sir. I quote, wemust fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail,whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have isolated three segments of thisrecording that are crucial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no platinum. Enterprise scanners did the rest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasmainfusion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive forapproximately three hundred years. The vessel is carrying variousunstable waste products. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, it does not. I do not feel pleasure. I am only anandroid. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: I did, but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I have no human instinct per se, I cannot advise you,Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away, yet they donot appear to penetrate this breathable zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The strategy is built on a single premise. The hostile intent ofthe Romulans. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find I am having difficulty deciding what kind of service tohave. Do you have any suggestions? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Barzan probe had no way to recognisethis. Eventually, both sides will be unstable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no indication of anything near the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will go with you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I feel it is important to determine the reason for <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Honey? I'm home. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A bomb has been detonated by Ansataterrorists. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is a pattern emerging from the signals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are inside Graves' home. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The combinations totalling seven or eleven have considerablevalue when achieved on the primary attempt. With eight variationspossible to create those totals, the likelihood of those totalsoccurring is not significant. However <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have not observed anyone else on board consulting you abouttheir procreation, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there any indication that Gosheven has changed his position? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, Lal gender sequence finalists. Begin. An Andorianfemale. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is more, sir. I have taken the liberty of expanding theparameters of my search, and have discovered that Pardek hasseveral relatives in the Krocton segment. I believe you will be able tolocate him there on the third day of the Romulan week when the Senateis not in session. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable. At lastknown course and speed, the Borg vessel should enter the system inthree minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As am I. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not a threat to you. Give me more time. Ourdestruction would only <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything. It is a void without matter or energy of any kind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that not exactly what we were doing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Second-hand, sir? Oh, of course. A human joke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Direct hit. Their weapon systems are down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am relieved that the injuries I inflicted on you are notpermanent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mrs Troi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I accept. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do, sir. She was frightened and did not wish to be left alone <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you realise that Commander Riker'shypotenuse question tricked you into showing your knowledge was greaterthan you were indicating? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in twenty sixseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The wave is continuing on course for the Lemma Twocolony. It is bearing zero two zero, mark three two nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems arefunctioning within normal parameters. For the forty seven seconds thatI was inactive, there is no record of cognitive activity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractorbeam. It might have deflected the transporter beam to a different setof coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why would the Captain not want to review allavailable information on the subject? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is being presented. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Her records were shipped by way of Starfleetheadquarters. They have not caught up with us yet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your leeway has run out, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off thenext tide. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shuttle escape transporter should provide enough power tobeam us <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptablewhen all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Q'Maire at station, holding steady at bearing zero one three,mark zero one five. Distance five oh six kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communicationwith the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir, and the resulting explosion wouldlikely destroy the saucer section in the process. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to recreate the experience which caused to myinitial burst of anger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are now entering the Turkana system, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitiveculture, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps that will be enough. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then perhaps we should begin our meal. Among humans, a low serumglucose level is often responsible for <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be extremely difficult to maintain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal, this is Geordi La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called for me,urgent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Lantree computer reports access codes received and accepted,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I dancing, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exocomps? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, that will not be necessary. The transporter is notmalfunctioning. I have locked out the controls. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can give her attention, Doctor. But I am incapable of givingher love. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is urgent that I speak to her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found,I discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet. Furtheranalysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the cause of the accident may be related to theexplosion on the Romulan ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of hissoldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Deck seventeen. Doctor, you have seemedpreoccupied since we surveyed the Kallisko. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A notably awkward experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Maquis ships are regrouping, sir. They are closing in on theCardassian vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The target must be specific, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was nopermanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Abandon ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The matter-antimatter injectors locked for a split second. I amnot certain why, sir. They appear to be working properly now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The only Class M planets in the system are Pentarus two and five,both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating static warp shell now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The use of gestures and hand signals pre dates the spoken word inmost cultures. The major exception being the Leyrons of Malkus Nine whoactually developed a written language first. Computer, continuepresentation. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are going to allow her to die, are we not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are his sentiments typical of the colonists? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can not allow you to endanger your well-being. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Too esoteric. More generic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nervous? I find this very interesting. Although I understand, intechnical terms, how life is formed, there is still a part of theprocess which eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to accesshis thought process? Does he have thoughts? You are aware of him. Is heaware of you? And when does that awareness begin? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That offer does present a certain fascination. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible the sensors were affected by interference from thewormhole, Commander. It is clearly not a class M planet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are outnumbered, Mister Barclay. Say you will yield and itends here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can control the rate of my follicle replenishment. However, Ihave not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair. Why do youask? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hmm. Yes. I find it fascinating that yourfamily chose to drop the prefix Pel from your surname. It was myunderstanding that Pel Orton is a more noble appellation on Arkariathan simply Orton. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, permission to beam down to Drema Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would need to study Manheim's records. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nine metres and closing. The energy output ofthe entity has doubled, Commander. Six metres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Visual on, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is against their nature to do so, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why is Spot under the bed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry readingthis afternoon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Chief O'Brien talks to me. Keiko talks to you. Why do they nottalk to each other? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My father did have an unusual way of looking at things. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Hathawaywill not survive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The transporters are considerably more efficient than those usedon the Potemkin eight years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg. I looked down at hisbody. I felt something. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I created her, using myself as a model. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but I have no whiskey to give you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. We will attempt to expedite our work. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm here to brief you on what he plans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Rigelian phaser rifles, sir. Not particularly powerful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eighty seven percent Saurian Brandy. Targ milk and Danisian meadcomprise the rest. There is an unusually high concentration of fructosecompounds and monosaccharides. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These questions suggest that we have made a successful transferof the heuristic associative pathways. You will now begin to processinformation on logic, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Youare truly becoming sentient, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emissions now at ten pulses per second. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For the past six hours, I have attempted toproduce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fascinating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which makes it important to know which of these weapons are to beused. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The contract agrees to deliver the people of Ventax Two into thepersonal servitude of Ardra after one thousand years of peace. I havecompared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet. Thelanguage of the agreement is correct in every detail, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I got angry. Captain's log, stardate 46982.1. Because of hisunusual behaviour on the planet surface, Commander Data has asked to betemporarily relieved of duty. Unfortunately, this means he will not beable to help us investigate a disturbing new change in the behaviour ofthe Borg. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did Moriarty release the voice commands, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally andphysically. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am certain the Admiral is anxious to meetLal. I have been sending him regular status reports on her development. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bingo? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. Is that not areference to an ancient Earth game? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small shipis approaching. I believe Mister Orton has dropped his defence shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Please, I want more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. His would seem to confirm that observation. Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not possible. Something is wrong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where is your mother? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. Doctor. I am honoured by your presence, but may Isuggest you attend the second concert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are approaching Starbase one seven nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the security lockout on Transporterroom six has been broken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty onepoints, I will definitely need another card. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The asteroid has shattered. However, the core is still intact andstill on a collision course with Tessen Three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA:  <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, there is no indication of other Borg activity within sensorrange. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How can they? It is my body now. It is out of their hands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is for your trouble. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They know everything I know, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The positronic matrix I designed for her was unstable. She onlylived a short time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That will not be necessary, Doctor. He is gone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, but we have evolved beyond any need for yourassistance. This vessel has become too confining. We requirerelocation. Captain's log, supplemental. Doctor Stubbs has usedhis influence to have planet Kavis Alpha Four designated the new homeof the nanite civilisation. Commander Data's neural network has beenvacated. He has been returned to us unharmed. And with the help of thenanites, our computer core has been reconstructed in time for theexperiment <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is an excellent idea. I will wait for them in there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tricorder's useless, sir. Communication's gone too. Fortunatelyyou did not break any <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Raise shields. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A fighter? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. In each of the three instances wecame into contact with one of the temporal fragments, we wereintegrated into its time frame. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, it is a personal project. I have reset the sensors to scanfor frequencies outside their usual range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The initial cybernetic connection into Captain Picard's neuralnet pathways has been established. Mister O'Brien is ready to processthe Borg signal through the transport pattern buffer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Commander. Apparently the probe has discovered. Astonishing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ira never told you how beautiful you were to him. He never toldyou that, did he? He could not tell you, do you understand? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The composition of the exposed rock face has been altered byexposure to triolic waves. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am curious as to what transpired between the moment when I wasnothing more than an assemblage of parts in Doctor Soong's laboratory,and the next moment, when I became alive. What was it that endowed mewith life? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I had no alternative. You would have destroyed the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The container does show evidence of residual ionisation. Ibelieve your hypothesis was correct. It was used to store high energyplasma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently the tactile sensors are too low. I will increase theinput. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A tetryon field would be formed briefly in the cabin, temporarilydisrupting the metaphasic shield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perfectly, Commander. I will be monitoring you continuously. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, I wish to know more about humour. Why certain combinations of words and actions make humans laugh. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beamsdesigned to guide ships into the sphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan thissystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They've been made fully aware of the situation, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a sense. The time shift is a gearing system I have inventedfor the horseless carriage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Keiko, I need your help. I have offended youand need to find a way to rectify my mistake. I am not sure what to do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How did you come to that decision? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you for allowing me to participate. It was remarkable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Three minutes, eleven seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, but I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am nearly finished compiling readings from our most recentilluminatory burst. Dark matter density is nearly one order ofmagnitude higher than in similar nebulae. Life forms here may havedeveloped in ways never before observed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To grow old together? That is an integral component of marriage? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Transmission from the planet surface, sir, Main viewer on. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemywith a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. Itwas considered extremely heroic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emotion, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibility, a malfunction in their engines, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no way to precisely calculate that, Commander, but it islikely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I beg your pardon? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you certain you are not saying this because you are mymother? I have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes totheir children's accomplishments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a recorded message, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The effect from the wormhole was rather intense. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When you get to be my age, you will understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All critical subcommands are protected,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are much more than that, Jenna. I have written a subroutinespecifically for you. Aprogramme within the programme. I have devoted a considerable share of my internal resources to itsdevelopment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Locking tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, transfer power from warp engines to life support. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you had better step out of the way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shall I, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then may I say your perturbation becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serveQueen and country. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was raining in the city by the bay. A hard rain. Hard enoughto wash the slime <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Working under the assumption that Kolrami was attempting to win,it is reasonable to assume that he expected me to play for the samegoal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot, sir. The emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place. Our linkup signal cannot penetrate them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris, but Itrust my point is clear. I am one android with a single weapon. Thereare hundreds of Sheliak on the way and their weapons are far morepowerful. They may not offer you a target. They can obliterate you fromorbit. You will die never having seen the faces of your killers. Thechoice is yours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Take us to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a courseof action without consulting the commanding officer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is on a secure channel, sir. In your ready room? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Good morning, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Comedy stressing farce and horseplay. Ah. This, no doubt, is avariation on pie in the face? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is alive, sir, but just barely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am operating within established parameters. How are you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Holding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to injector lock. An emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The planet is Vagra Two, sir, in the Zed Lapis sector. Uninhabited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have cleared the asteroids, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are several cultures in this sector with extremely similaretymological histories. For example <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With the advocate's withdrawal, the contract is hereby dissolved. This arbitration is adjourned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Electromagnetic and subspace wave frontsapproaching synchronisation. WORF <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is improbable, but it is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you so desire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Its line is both fluid and formal, yet retains an unpremeditatedquality. The tactility of its surfaceembellishment is evocative of the neo-primitive period in Tyrineanblade carving. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If they were cloaked in some way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must see the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you noticed another discontinuity? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore, sir. He was inadvertently summoned here by the same signalwhich activated my homing circuitry. It seems that after nearly twoyears in interstellar space, he was <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not doubt you, Doctor, but I have tried one hundred seventythree phonetic variations of the name, and I <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method ofdrawing the audience into the plight of your character. You gave atruly realistic interpretation of multi-infarct dementia. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have full confidence in your persuasive abilities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With intelligence, there is the capability of language, but itwill depend on how far their evolution has brought them. We couldmodify the circuitry in the universal translator to make it capable ofcommunications with them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An uncustomary reshuffling of personnel, usually in the commandareas. The new officers have had frequent contact with the highestlevels of Starfleet Command. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The emergency transporter armbands contain a type seven phasediscriminator. It should be possible to reconfigure their subspaceemitters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android, not a robot. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanners shows limited armaments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jessel. She can be frightfully trying at times, but she does makeme laugh. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe I have found the cause of the power surge. There is a warp core breach in progress. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. The breach can be temporarily sealed byextending our shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They've trapped us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no life signs aboard, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've never seen anyone eat ten chocolate sundaes. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, peridaxon <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is in direct physical contact with our shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is unclear what affect a photon torpedo would have on atwo-dimensional beings, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors locked on probes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shuttle launch sequence confirmed. DepartingEnterprise in exactly three seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twentythree minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I had been your biological offspring, would you have left meon Omicron Theta? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, our options appear quite limited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am running the base drilling programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the refractory metals in the rock strata may alsointerfere with communication. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So Lal now possesses the sum of myprogramming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Wes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing makes me laugh. I wish to learn. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Has been absorbed into the rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Sickbay. Medical emergency in main Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres. However, Iam reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilised. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As a Starfleet officer, I am required to follow all of yourorders, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Take this creature, for example. He does not exhibit any DNAstructure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you here to find a wedding gift? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to themicroorganism is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have been unable to detect a signal from her communicator. Either it has been deactivated or she is being held in a shieldedlocation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have located the shuttle. It is under attack. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering, display computer core processor four five one,element zero two nine nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. The Romulans have the same capability todirect the impact of their weapons as we do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeed, sir. In the story, the spirits used fear to motivateScrooge to reform his character. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanning the planet, sir. No life forms, no power sources, noweapons systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would be a case of judging us by our own rules, sir. If weviolate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us to be deceitfuland untrustworthy. You do recall they cautioned us not to interferewith their children below. What has happened? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibility, a kind of human behaviour I was not designed toemulate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would like some music? Brahms? Aurelia? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Distortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds. Hull stressis nearing maximum tolerance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is even more significant than the object itself, Counsellor. On several of its surfaces, the molecules seem to have disintegrated <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an ice man. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must find a way to contact the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Completely, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have coated this piece of cloth with theliquid which is used in lamps. As you can see, the cloth becomesluminescent when it is exposed to an energy source. This pendant alsoappears to be an energy source. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Attempting to re-route subcommand paths,Captain. Defence systems are protected by access barriers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander, but sensors have not yet locked onto its exactwhereabouts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are within four kilometres of the magmapocket. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on severaloccasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run afull analysis on the kittens once they <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apparently no one. Helm and navigation controls are notfunctioning. Our speed is now warp seven point three and holding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply. It will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is puzzling. Three more chroniton fields have formed aboardthe Enterprise in the last hour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I appear to be reversing that defeat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are being pulled inside. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Extremely rude behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sphere appears to be abandoned. Sensorsshow that the star is extremely unstable. It is experiencing severebursts of radiation and matter expulsions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, where are you going? Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Humans are mortal. They seem to need a sense of continuity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The hologram generator is now functioning, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, Iwould not be the instrument of his death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Highly, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I found it extremely interesting. The lateral sensor arrays ranthree separate spectral analyses of the Alawanir Nebula on threedistinct frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are approaching the Devron system,Captain. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directlyahead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The T'Ong has changed course to three twomark eight one. Increasing to warp three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That bearing is almost directly along our planned course, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by for auto-phaser interlock. Activating deflector beam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He says to the shopkeeper, I'd like a pound of kiddillies,please. The shopkeeper says to him, You meankidneys, don't you? The man says, I said kiddillies, diddle I? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Excuse me. Aside from the main door, is there anotherexit I might use? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not, sir. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntaryconfinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you haveviolated Federation law <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is It is It isgreen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I disturbing you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lal? I am unable to correct the systemfailure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twenty six minutes. After that, the distortion field willre-phase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The asteroid's gravity is drawing us closer. Velocity isincreasing. Velocity still increasing. Now at two hundred and nineteenmetres per second. Starboard aft thruster. You have used the asteroid'sgravitational pull as a slingshot. Excellent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. The Captain is usually the last to leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science,the beginning of wisdom, is I do not know. I do not know what that is, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And I have no fear of killing you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It reads similar to early Starfleet efforts but uses theHeglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different. Which is actually not important at this time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred andnineteen fatalities over a three day period. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I sincerely hope so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years, sir. Thelack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are ready to bring the interface online,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It had a black handle and a serrated blade, and it was quitelong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, that was it, Geordi. This wakens a memory remnant of how thecolonists hoped to remain hidden, but their fear of being discoveredled to their storing information in me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The real secret is turning disadvantage to advantage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am familiar with many Klingon rituals, including the B'aht Qul. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, that is no longer the case. I have recently convertedmy interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation, which removed theperformance constraint. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which one? 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker just has been encased in some kind of energyfield. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the perpetrator reprogrammed the memory chips to eraseany record. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, I am not capable of hatred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A sensible precaution, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Well, sir, I doubt they wear red, white and blue, or lookanything like Uncle Sam. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will try, but the Intrepid was at the edge of sensor rangeduring the attack and we cannot be sure if the scan was complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How now, spirit. Whither wander you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps, for humans, old things represent a tie to the past. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There are two possible destinations. The BrechtianCluster and the Argos system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The access would be available by code orpassword. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eventually, sir. I am working on it now but the number ofpermutations is almost endless. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from thelife form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must emphasize, Mister Fajo, that I consider this captivity ahostile act on your part. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The comet's outer shell is composed primarily ofgaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner coreconsists of heavier elements <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility, Captain. If that hypothesis is correct, thephenomenon we justencountered would be a temporal rift in space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, have you completed themetallurgical scan of the Array? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing I have seen before. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I don't trust him. It may be a deception. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The game is five card draw, no limit. Ante, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Look at his shoes. He's more a convict, released today fromDartmoor prison. He spent the day in a tavern consuming large quantities of gin with hiskiller, who followed him to this spot and waited over there until thevictim slipped into a drunken stupor. Then, out of fear, motivated onlyby self-protection, strangled him. There is your killer, Inspector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I help? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is highly improbable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour,approximately one degree Celsius. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable toblock it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who use two largestones which are continuously struck during the meal. Those at thedinner must eat until the stones are broken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibellevels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The structure is located at the centre of the vegetation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Theoretically, sir, it should work. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Old things? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes are far superior to humanbiological eyes. True? Then why are not all human officers required tohave their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants? I see. It is precisely because I am not human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of the risks involved. But I can think of no other wayto investigate my experience. Will you help? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue. I would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at McKinleystation, the hatch casing was replaced with one which had anundetectable defect. I believe, sir, that the conclusion to ourinvestigation must be that the explosion was not intentional. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, current location of Commander LaForge? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am studying skin samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt toisolate the cause of the illness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs to Fajo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know that. This is just a thing, and things can be replaced. Lives cannot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where is Commander Riker? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Less than five thousand kilometres, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark threeone oh. It's the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we have not regained control of thepropulsion systems. The bypass to the Bridge has been blocked. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Atmospheric contaminants have dropped to less than one part pertrillion. The ecosystem has been restored to its natural state. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed another full scan of thearea, sir. There is no further indication of the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Minister. He has not returned to our designated transportcoordinates. We have continued to scan the capital city withoutsuccess. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, that is not an appropriate basis for an effectiveperformance. Not by the standards set by my mentors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are nearing the MS system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You would not consider it to be an honour? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe's field intensity is continuing to build, sir. We arein danger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How could you, Doctor? He has not said anything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps these artefacts have a special value to the Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then my work with him is done. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well,Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. As an energy pattern, free of the limitations ofmatter, he might travel anywhere, at any velocity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My medals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When he was attempting to contact the real Bridge, he was in factspeaking to a simulation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are not receiving Rana Four's call sign. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed becausesome of the wood had rotted. Did I do something wrong, Garvin? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is released, sir. Force field is maintaining ourhull integrity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert ourbodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no indication of debris. However, the subspace signal indicates a warp engine breach. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We agree. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand your reaction. But I do not wish to harm you. You orGarvin or anyone else. I only wish to help, to find a cure for theillness. I was very close. I must to continue my work, but it will taketime. How long until Skoran and the others return? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, eliminate programme one. Computer, eliminate programmetwo. Computer, eliminateprogramme three. Computer, half volume. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels. They took control of Counsellor Troi's body to communicate with us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can repair the damaged plasma vent fromhere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have identified the signal. It is from the USSJenolen, a Federation transport ship reported missing in this sectorseventy five years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The Tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beaminto the upper atmosphere. The result is a hyperionisation thatvirtually disrupts all EM and subspace carriers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I recognise these symbols. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirelyunpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described interms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But thatdescription does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that farexceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Clearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, the control is still yours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Even if the molecular level controls have failed, we can stillrecrystallise the dilithium without outside help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel appears undamaged, sir. Its defences are apparentlyable to absorb incoming matter and energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe sends information via a focused particle beam. Itshould be able to cut through the interference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He served in many campaigns during the Tarsian War, received twopromotions, to the rank of Subhadar. A very honourable tour of duty <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Without external influence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not very much, sir. The only recorded contact with the Delossystem was over two hundred years ago. A scout ship reported twoinhabited planets, one of which was on the verge of acquiring spacetravel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps her species has a perception that goes beyond lineartime. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indubitably, my good woman. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. We found no malfunctions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will need to add a specific amount ofantimatter to rebalance and align the system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To follow in your footsteps, as it were? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. I am notsure he is a Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inquiry. Private eye? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the early twenty-second century, Earth was recovering fromWorld War Three. A major philosopher of the period was Liam Dieghan,founder of the Neo-Transcendentalists, who advocated a return to asimpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature, and learnedunder her gentle tutelage <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor? Lal has narrowed the choices to four. Would you liketo see? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have taken your suggestion regarding Spot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Armaments consist of four laser cannons and thirty nine cobaltfusion warheads with magnetic propulsion. Defensive shield output isfour point three kilojoules. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despitewhat happened to her, I still have that wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The dips and peaks of the galaxy's magnetic field, organicmolecules in nebular clouds, energetic cosmic rays. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is fortunate we were able to coordinateyour return on the Teldarian cruiser. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The boy was listed as missing, presumed dead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was hoping you would be able to determine that from hertransporter trace pattern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity betweenthe three time periods the Captain hasvisited, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. However, the sensor data gathered thus farsuggests a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your brother was right handed! The alleged suicide note waswritten by a left handed individual such as yourself! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A transporter would leave residual ionizationin the air. Our tricorder readings found no trace after the incident. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: understanding the Prime Directive, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A supposition not supported by the transporter records. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shh. We're getting out of here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One fact is clear, however. The distortion was growing instrength. If we had remained at our original position one point sevenseconds longer, the distortion would have ruptured our warp core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, approaching Starbase one threethree. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At that speed sir, we should arrive nine point six three hoursbehind the original schedule, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Distortion wave impact in five seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, create dance partner. Female. Begin music. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have returned. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: His queries to me primarily focused on Doctor Soong's <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. Their phaser banks are not armed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have good news. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready to dock, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And what is the significance of the anniversary of this event? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I have modified the Method for my own uses. Since I have noemotional awareness to create a performance, I am attempting to useperformance to create emotional awareness. I believe if I can learn toduplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, I will be one step closer totruly understanding humanity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radioactive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe this will produce the desired effect. I will use it todraw Worf to a another part of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens,this instrument will have a higher effective magnification. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting. Perhaps I could modify your sister's techniques tokeep Spot from jumping on console. Do you know how she was able totrain her cat? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are several archaeological sites inthis sector containing ruins which are Romulan in origin. These are thelocations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data is not human! He is <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the rate the levels are decreasing, we will gain entry inforty nine hours, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No other ship is indicated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show anestazine concentration seventy parts per millionwithin the cargo bays. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could you take me there? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was so small in fact we didn't have a godfather of crime, wehad a nephew. Iwas so ugly as a child they hung a pork chop around my neck so the dog would play with me. And then there was thehuman cannonball who was hired and fired in the same night. Audienceprogramme off. Discontinue Comic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There do not seem to be enough waiters on duty. 3 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The answer is yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. When you attempted to override the exocomp and send it backinto the tunnel, it responded by deliberately burning out its controlinterface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you tried, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, release compound into the airflow system, fiveparts per million. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The facts to date would lead to an objective conclusion that heis not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it was a beacon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Locked on. We can beam Nuria aboard at will. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information inmy tricorder, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra Two by a malevolent entity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you suggesting that it employs memory like an organiccell? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship's computer would have corrected immediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Talur is correct. You should rest. I will attend to your father. Gia, when did you begin wearing that pendant? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He's on ice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Press your fingers there, Doctor. There. It operates almost as a switch. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Alert starbase. Inform them we are abandoningthe ship. Tell them why. Initiate automated sequence for departure. Setcourse and speed course and speed to put maximum distance between theEnterprise and any inhabited planets. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were unable to maintain phase match withthe distortion wave, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a most intriguing idea, sir. I do not believe a tachyonbeam was ever used in such a way. I had no idea you were so versed inthe intricacies of temporal theory, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are down there, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, Starbase one three three has no record at all of a DoctorDalen Quaice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That seems to be it's method of reprogramming, Captain. Each boltof light consists of negatively and positively charged ions. A seriesof programme instructions, as it were. It seems to have a quickerrapport with our computers than we have. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Right, That's enough. Sit down, both of you. You over there, youthere. Down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The field emissions are particularly strong in this area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Patch him through, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Were you expecting a different result this time, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Admiral is definitely incorrect. The tunnelschematics we have show this to be a dead end. It was sealed off twoyears ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cargo bay four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used atheta-band subspace delivery system. Captain Picard is one of onlythree Starfleet Captains with extensive experience in theta-banddevices. The other two are no longer in Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Federation has charted but not explored several class Mplanets in that area. Any one of these planets might well serve as abase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is this level sufficient? Geordi? Geordi, do you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Indri system was first identified by Federation vesselsnearly sixty years ago. The eighth planet is L-class. It is covered bydeciduous vegetation, unexplored, with no apparent evidence ofcivilisations, either present or past. The planet possesses no animallife whatsoever. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will prepare the power transfer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do you wish to talk about? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Barnum, sir. PT. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, like your sister. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am incapable of anger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not just a matter of control, Doctor. The signals areinteractive across a subspace domain similar to that of a Transporterbeam. I wouldhypothesise that these frequencies form the basis of the Borg'scollective consciousness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and ishailing us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gia, I think we should leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They pose no danger to humans. However, some of the ship'ssystems may be affected by prolonged exposure. When I return I willdevise a method to eradicate them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise and the warbird both appear to be trapped withinone of the temporal fragments. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most interesting. Could this be human joke number six hundredsixty three? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is the way I think of him, sir. My only living relative, nolonger living. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It matches Commander Worf's quantum signatureprecisely. I have remodulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inversewarp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise momentyou enter the fissure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Armus is capable of creating undefined forcefields. In effect, weare powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allowsit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A level-four diagnostic of the foodreplication systems has failed to detect any faults in the orientationterminals. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can easily furnish the nanites with a schematic design of myneurological structure. Entering my neural network would require nomore than their most basic skills. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel atwarp velocities, there are but two possibilities. Either it is a sensormalfunction, another ship is following us covertly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The main deflector dish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanning. The Fleming is near its previous coordinates. Itappears to be intact, but it is now within the rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would be an incorrect assumption. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a great deal of electromagnetic interference. I amunable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How sad, dear brother. You make me wish I were an only child. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He just collapsed, sir. Captain's log, stardate 42823.2. We're departingfrom Starbase Seven Three to investigate the source of the mysteriousdistress signal. Meanwhile, my Security Officer remains in Sickbay,where Doctor Pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I tried to caution you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps there is nothing to read. Nothing more than mechanismsand algorithmic responses. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. It would appear that the nodes are in theprocess of creating a rudimentary neural net. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am unfamiliar with that term. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is very important for me to know that, sir. I never dreamed itwas possible I might find some link with some form like my own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Strange, sir. There's no emergency signal from the shuttle asyet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could not leave them there, Captain. The condition of theirvehicle was deteriorating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe I can recalibrate our sensors to readthrough the electromagnetic interference over the poles. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No abnormal surges indicated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what itproposes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no significant difference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Q says he has hurt his back. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ionisation pulse complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is really you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And more, perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, that would not be appropriate. Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at theedge of the Neutral Zone, where we will now have an opportunity tolearn firsthand what happened to our distant outpost. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pulaski, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you are not an historian. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is highly unlikely. Our investigations have clearlydemonstrated <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I understand. You are in competition with Mister Kaplan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, Idiscovered that my memory banks contained the contents of theirjournals and logs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do not initiate that power transfer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears he has us both. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wonder, what would Doctor Freud say about the symbolism ofdevouring oneself? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Go ahead, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to setup the infusion units are somewhat unstable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot tell you anything beyond what I have already stated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What command shall I try to plant? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we do, we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitablelocation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. I do not have access to the containment field. You willhave to establish a new link. Locate the conduit, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hardly, sir. I believe this analogy refers to the worst qualityof capitalists. The Ferengi are believed to conduct their affairs ofcommerce on the ancient principle caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These are the elements we have available. Some of them could beused in the creation of an explosive reaction. If we could communicatethis inventory to the other ship, perhaps they would be able to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on themoon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of thesignal, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Temperature increase is at one hundred six percent and rising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. It might be due to problems currently being experiencedby the Yamato. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. A voice only transmission from the Lantree, aFederation supply ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No life signs, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because you will lose their confidence? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What am I doing here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no reports of any Federation ships in that area, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, it is highly unlikely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. For a reason I cannot explain, I had the need todestroy it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, eighty years ago the Lornaks massacred a rival clan,the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will have to be, sir. The next transport window will not occurfor another eight years, when the planet's orbit will bring it closeenough to the sun to de-phase the distortion field. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is well patched, sir. Closed indicates a permanent condition,which I cannot guarantee. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Positive indication of armed photontorpedoes, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Medical assistance to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Barzans do not have manned space travel, so they had toresort to an automated probe. Its findings are limited. It cannot bedetermined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is, or howlong it will remain intact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is very good to see you both again. Beverly. May I call youBeverly? Beverly, have you noticed that the mean temperature here onArkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels? I havefound that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degreesCelsius in order to operate most efficiently. However, there areseveral cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature isidentical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing. The Sheliak, for example. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I am fortunate, sir, to be spared the emotionalconsequences. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds to impact, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Caught in the after effect. I amattempting <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, I am not under your nor anyone else's command. I haveresigned from Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would require an emotional context which I cannot provide. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Radioactive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only to say that she was lucky to have escaped. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe that is the case, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, Starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to OceanusFour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Am I to understand that Garvin's illness has spread? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing andstorage capacity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have completed the spectralevaluation of the outer shell. Our survey of this protostar iscomplete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can easily check the transporter ID traces. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I said the process should take less than two hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sustained. The advocate will refrain from expressing personalaffections for her opponent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Command functions are being rerouted, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am afraid they will not believe you either. Gia, is the well inthe town square the only source of water for this village? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The case involves a contract dispute over services rendered by aKlingon craftsman on the construction of a Ventaxian home. Because thedispute involved an alien culture, the parties decided that arbitrationrather than the courts, should resolve the issue. Both sides agreed tochoose an arbiter. It is the only known case involving an alienclaimant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the contrary, you have been a great deal of help. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have the readout on Dytallix B, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If that were the purpose, there would be evidence of a moresophisticated monitoring system. These containers were designed solelyfor refrigeration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Any more disruptions and I will rule you in contempt of court. Isthat understood? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstanddebate? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He has provided important theoretical guidance for Geordi'sanalysis of the Bre'el satellite, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A coin. Very good. I will replicate one immediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have your feelings for Chief O'Brien changed? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Considerable fire damage to interior surface reported, sir. Butnone of her main systems were crippled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but since the illness struck all three in a relatively shortperiod of time, it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent andunusual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Lore. I now have duties to perform. Unless of course,you need something more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not without further study. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He appears to be in some kind of stasis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which thedistress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain that is true. I believe I have an idea. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our mission is part of a highly coordinated effort to put an endto the war. There are other vessels on other fronts, all workingaccording to an intricate plan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then perhaps there is a way I can access the machine, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Disengaging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant. That is precisely what we must do. Since there are no viable alternatives, we will return to the surfaceand attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on thisplanet. An investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose. Please notify me when you have assembled your search teams. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. She is in grave danger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These incidents are common to cat owners. When you borrowed Spot,you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviourbefore getting a cat yourself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. It has been a pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Single digits on each cube are not at all desirable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To do so would have been pointless. All things must pass. May Igo now, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe you will find, Inspector, that this emissary here worksnot for but against the King of Bohemia, and that photograph of theking and his mistress is to be used as blackmail. Further, upon deeperreflection, you will deduce, as did I, that <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is nothing here of relevance. I do not see how thisconnects with the disappearance of the Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, scan the shuttle's structuralintegrity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is your condition, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I did not come for him. I came for you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Sarjenka's transmission could be viewed as a call for help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am painting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I am attempting to master all known styles of painting. Thisone is in the style of the early French impressionists. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations, Captain. Mostunusual ones. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Impulse engines are down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then your answer is no. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will find Doctor Pulaski in here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Distribution nodes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are being boarded. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You share all of those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you shouldtry to build on your similarities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are not my mother. That is the appropriate response for yourstatement that I am behaving foolishly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why am I lying on the floor in this undignified position with thefour of you standing over me, displaying expressions of concern? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is a traditional gift? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the present rate, containment failure willoccur in approximately nine minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish I were as confident as you, Counsellor. When I wasfighting the Borg, I felt angry, but when I think back on the incident,I realise that I was also experiencing another sensation. It was notthe same as anger, but I think it was an emotion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask you a question, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have none, sir. I recommend we launch a probe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run uncheckedthrough the entire ship. Attempts to develop an inoculants have so farended in failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has Bridge command pendingyour return, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Auxiliary generators losing power, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly thirteen hours, nine minutes, twenty two seconds, threehundred fifty <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing three three sevenmark ten. It has disappeared again, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commencing graviton emissions now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I expected to make new friends. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Attitude control has been restored. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. It seems unlikely that Jo'Bril would performsabotage which would result in his own death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam onit. Seize it, limit it's field of fire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The purpose of which is? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be awelcome diversion after a long assignment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, Nuria is alone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Serova and Rabal believe there are regions ofpotential subspace instability within the Corridor. They believe thatif these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy, they willrupture. Subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors can locate no debris from the Romulan ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Transportation of colonists, diplomatic missions, emergencyevacuations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot. I will not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But that would defeat the opportunity for our behaviouralresearch. In all probability, he is simply lonely. We can relieve hisanxiety through socialisation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, we are nearing the perimeter. One million kilometresaway. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is the chip my father created for me so that I couldexperience emotions. I had it removed from Lore's body before he wasdismantled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi thinks he is in command here, and he is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Considering the power demonstrated by Q the last time, anywhere. Assuming this place even exists. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The same distance could be achieved in a matter of secondsthrough the wormhole. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah, a word that ends in K. So, if you put funny teeth in yourmouth and jump around like an idiot, that is considered funny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The correct procedure would be to adjust the converter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, dim lights. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe his basic research lacks the specificsnecessary to support an experiment of this magnitude. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, I noted that Keiko was quite calm andrational when she informed me of her decision this morning. Therefore,I can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of thesituation based on the available facts. It is fortunate that she hasnot let emotional considerations cloud her judgement. It should make mytask much simpler. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no need for an apology. Perhaps if you indulged in abrief rest period, you would be able to approach this problem with afresh point of view. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Projection, sir. We may be able to match hostile's nine pointeight, sir. But at extreme risk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Delta vee is ninety two metres per second. The mass is too great. We are having an effect but it is negligible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis. accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we were to continue this analogy toa body function, what occurred would be best represented by a <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Muskets are appropriate to the 1790 to 1800 French army uniform,sir. But it is hardly a weapon by our standards. A lead ball propelledby gunpowder. One hundred metres at best with any accuracy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? Youare dismantling a warp plasma conduit. I must ask you to stop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. The gratuity. Thank you for your assistance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. It is a ruse. This way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tractor beam originated somewhere in the Prytt Alliance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They have been sitting here for three hours seventeen minutes. They refuse to transport back to the ship with the rest of Gowron'smen. They insisted on waiting here until they see Kahless again. Theirfaith appears to be unaffected by his inability to defeat Gowron. Theystill believe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit. Iam detecting no bodies of water, no vegetation, no artificialstructures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard wanted no risk of our communications beingoverheard. You are to proceed now as he indicated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain, sir. However, joined together they would make arectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty one square metres. Ifput end to end vertically, they would make a pole forty four metreshigh, or two of twenty two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fire. Fire! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As apparently you do, Mister Clemens. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is theirfavourite on the ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. Wewill give more attention to the rhythmic patterns at our nextrehearsal. However, I am quite certain the audience was oblivious tosuch nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They could mean anything. Unless we can narrow the parameters ofthe search, it would be almost impossible for the computer to identifythe pattern with any accuracy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warship is three hundred thousand kilometres from thePhoenix. It is opening fire. The Phoenix has taken a directhit. The Phoenix is beginning evasive manoeuvres. It has positioneditself outside the weapons range of the opposing ship. The Phoenix has powered up both phasers and photon torpedoes. ThePhoenix is firing photon torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you know, Captain, we are looking for aphenomenon that reoccurs every five hours, twenty minutes and threeseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Impulse engines are now at one hundred twenty five percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have traced the failure to a data netinterface which routes replicator selections to the correctsubprocessors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A homing beacon, sent from Earth. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: Dealer takes two. You control the bet, Lieutenant. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave theholodeck. He never did. Neither did we. None of this is real. It is asimulation. We are still on the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifty three seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our abilities, andwe were prepared to continue studying the problem. But that was notsatisfactory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Judging a being by its physical appearance is the last majorhuman prejudice, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am differentiating particle-emissionsignatures now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fifty one minutes, fourteen seconds, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Although Alpha Onias three is a class Mplanet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have I said something to offend you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Greetings, gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate the field generators on the planet surface arecharging, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are correct. Ninety two minutes, seventeen seconds havepassed since you left the room. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were seeking raw materials for our replicating process. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensor readings indicate the presence of aG-type star at the centre of the sphere. There also appears to be aclass-M atmosphere clinging to the interior surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imagingresolution by twenty five percent or more. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was not meant as a joke. The tongue slipped. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But, but, Geordi, I was just about to revealthat the sir is in fact amadam <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander La Forge and I have come up with apotential solution to our predicament. Perhaps the modifications usedto increase firepower against the Borg could be effective here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An accident in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The human race has an enduring desire for knowledge, and for newopportunities to improve itself. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is certainly not consistent with his android persona. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. Energy only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have recently had an unusual experience, which might bedescribed as a vision. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, on screen. Alien vessel approaching at half impulse,sir. Heading zero five one mark one one four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is definitely the street on which theintelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir. Adjusting for theoptical distortions, I am able to verify the architectural features. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is possible. I may also have been inadvertently responsiblefor the unexplained appearances of the number three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Structural reinforcement is at two hundredforty percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I anticipated that diversionary tactic based on his pattern todate. We are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven metresin length and three metres in diameter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe I am being helped by this session. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Pulaski is unwilling to trust the turbolifts. She issending medical teams through the access tunnels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, that is a flower, Lal. Inhale. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no other emotions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Children often do not develop discerning palettes until wellbeyond adolescence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have some information regarding Amanda Rogers' parents. Recordsindicate that they died in Topeka, Kansas. Their home was destroyed during a tornado. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit aroundthe planet. It reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Co-ordinates set. Warp six on your mark, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reverse power. Decelerating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I bet five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Magnifying viewer image. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are wrong, Geordi. I can. I do not need rest or diversion. Ishould not have been painting. I was negligent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now running it throughlanguage and logic circuits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am incapable of any feeling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure, sir, that Icannot say. Sir, I am finding it difficult to understand many aspectsof Ansata conduct. Much of their behavioral norm would be defined by myprogramme as unnecessary and unacceptable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are now entering position. Radiationlevels are rising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are now entering orbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I can explain if you would just give me a moment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Show me the shortest route to Transporter room one. Computer,prepare to activate cascade force field sequence in the followingprogression. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Silence that child! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is unlikely that they would receive our communication, sir. The Topin system contains an unstable protostar. It generatessignificant magnetoscopic interference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a fix on it, sir. Inside Captain Picard's quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The away team is returning to the Enterprise, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Run programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In fact, we are, Commander. However <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are always welcome, Captain. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. They exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns. Very possibly organic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not remember being in an accident. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, when the Fleming activated their warp drive, the riftexpanded by two point three percent. We no longer have sufficientmomentum to escape. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, someone in Engineering is attemptingto override the security system lockout. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may enter now. LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I thought it might be significant, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But no sound of power. No equipment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading a massive explosion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was Starfleet officers who rescued me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the aliens have disappeared, and sohas the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrowevening. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see, sir. Oh, I see, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ardra is right. If I am chosen, I will perform my duties withoutbias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee I will deliver a verdict in yourfavour. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we have located the source of the energy residual. It appears to be concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But the colony was destroyed. There were no survivors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will change into my uniform, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But this vessel? And the temporal distortion that coincided withyour arrival? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Imprecise, Lieutenant. They omittedcertain truths, which in itself tells us something. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors still show nothing out there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aceton assimilators are a primitive generator which can drainpower from distant sources. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do not apologise, Doctor. I believe we have discovered somethingsignificant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We must be able to use the transporters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reproduction? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you for your advice, but I'm trying to find two individualswith a snake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One set of footfalls are widely spaced. The other is evenlyspaced, closer together. Further, on the ground you can see theswirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumablyto see if he is being followed. Left footed means left handed. The darkcolouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type ofnon-conductive soles used by researchers experimenting withelectricity. Finally, there can be no argument, the game is afoot! Come, Watson! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, may I see you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is an attainable goal, but it will require realigning thewarp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid offline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sensors cannot identify the point of origin. It seems to becoming from all around us. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, is it possible there are areas inside the rift which arestable, where we can safely use our warp engines? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Working together with the aliens, we must discover a means bywhich we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of uscould achieve alone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I am not mistaken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am confused. Why have I not been assigned to command a ship inthe fleet, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correction. The second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean,now dry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown. Captain's log, supplemental. Some kind of weapon,which for a time took the form of Captain Paul Rice, has envelopedCommander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find myself in complete agreement with that assessment of thesituation, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet personnel have vanished. Others may be at risk. We mustdo the best we can to find out why. However, I am strongly motivated tosolve this mystery. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see no other possible explanation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Given the effects we have observed, the probability isexceedingly remote, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But no one has bet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No active subspace fields. Negligible power readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I detect no unusual readings along standard parameters. Curious. The transparent aluminum alloy of this window is exhibiting a patternof transient electrical currents. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She was special to me, sir. We were intimate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data to Enterprise. I ampreparing to leave Tau Cygna Five and await rendezvous instructions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. From inside the Romulan Zone. We should be able to viewthe transmission. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear that you require a third party to intervene onyour behalf. I will be happy to speak to her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready now, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He seemed certain that if she knew, it would preclude thepossibility of her being happy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am apparently guilty of falsifying the Enterprise's records, ofinterfering with an investigation, of disobeying adirect order from my commanding officer. Your duty seems clear, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are wrong, Captain. My brother and I serve a much higherpurpose. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have tried it from time to time. But you are correct. I do notrequire rest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not mean to belittle your condition. I understand yourdilemma. But I am curious. Myprogramme can be altered. Yours cannot? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed, sir. Their customs concerning guests make it muchpreferable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I deactivated Data and transferred my mind into his frame. Inever imagined how much of my self I would retain. My feelings, mydreams. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Barclay has not yet extended himself into theEngineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an bypassdirectly to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What type of journey? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the present context, what did she mean by bust him up? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My friend Chief O'Brien often says thatabove all else, he wants to make Keiko happy. Since cancelling thewedding will make her happy, I must conclude the Chief will be pleasedat her decision. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is Lal. Lal, say hello to Counsellor Deanna Troi <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have lost helm control, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tone of Commander Riker's voice makes me suspect that heis not serious about finding Ambassador T'Pel charming. My experiencesuggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says. irony is a form of expression I have not yet been able to master. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For whatever finds us, my dear Watson. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninetythree percent of normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet,sir. It is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundariesby an outer covering of silicates, actinides, and carbonaceouschondrites. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is nothing left of OutpostDelta Zero Five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams. But I believe I canimprovise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuouslyrecollimating the output. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is impossible to tell from a visual inspection. However, itappears to be focused on the warbird's Engineering section. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your hypothesis is certainly plausible. There may be another shipon the other side of the fissure, where we cannot detect it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I fail to understand the value you place on my presence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not precisely. Geordi, does the configuration of connection nodeslook familiar to you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? Was I making noise, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I just had a strange conversation with your assistant. Although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship Victory,she <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Full ambassadorial status, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Or when one of them hits us. My readings suggest that thedeformations themselves are in motion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: During the original incident the Borg presented a genuine dangerto my life. Since the Holodeck safety routine is in place, I know mylife is not in danger. Since I am trying to duplicate the conditions ofthe original incident as closely as possible, I must also attempt toduplicate the jeopardy as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And the Berlin can safely withstand aRomulan attack, and deducted our time to destination at maximum warpspeed. That leaves Doctor Crusher forty eight minutes to develop aninoculants to the virus. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to my memory log, I did not use those words. Ya'll mustbe mistaken. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was intrigued. Jenna seemed to be displaying genuine affectionfor me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is something wrong, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reasoning. From the general to the specific. Is that not the verydefinition of deduction? Is that not the way Sherlock Holmes worked? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, thank you. Excuse me, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a limitation we must learn to accept, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I shall miss you, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds tocritical. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am a personal friend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Speculation. Could it be alive? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communicationchannel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we canattain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. Their impulse system is down as well, Powergeneration is at extremely low levels. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. None. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way, it mayalleviated the guilt. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Baby needs a new pair of shoes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Channel is open, sir. Vorn responding to hail. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. In actuality, less than one percent of the Enterprise crewwas involved. It was necessary to balance theory withexperiential referents. Both are required for a programme of thisnature. Computer, decrease illumination level by one third standardlux. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not offended. You are upset. Your reactions are notsurprising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were a colleague of Doctor Soong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hair brush. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but use of sickbay equipment is limited to ship'smedical personnel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct. Based on the antiproton decay, I would estimate theincident occurred within the last four point three hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, biolab four is one of the areas that will be floodedwith ion radiation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story istrue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at all, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Will you take care of Spot for me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. That will never change. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Quite correct. Then may I ask another question after this one? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are still no life form readings coming from the vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experiencedhad an unexpected effect on the ship's systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet records contain no mention of the Duras sisters aftertheir departure from Deep Space Nine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. And? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That may provide an explanation for the tactics he was able touse against us when we tried to capture him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you are referring to the illness, you are partially correct. However, it is more complex than that. The metal fragment which <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared betweenfriends. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension, it is oftenhelpful to find elements of commonality. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Cancel programme. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliverthis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, you will find a small alien ship off the starboardbow. Please secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What has happened here? Doctor. Doctor Soong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Emits charge when lit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This way sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am comingto the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, it would appear that my programme designedto predict the emotional responses needs adjustment. Second Officers personal log, supplemental. This isthe one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the Enterprise wascommissioned. Besides the arrival of Ambassador T'Pel, other events occurring todayinclude four birthdays, two personnel transfers, a celebration of theHindu Festival of Lights, two chess tournaments, one secondary schoolplay, and four promotions. Overall, an ordinary day. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible. If I could further scan the aperture, it might bepossible to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate theanomaly. If we had information on the centre of the phenomenon, wemight have a basis for speculation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It's off the scale, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Whenever I am on the ship, the warp field leaves anelectromagnetic signal on my internal servo-fluid system. Between theperiod of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours thatsignature is missing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only a layer of dust. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Captain had asked the question. Can we assume youmean this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated, yes,absolutely equitable. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To date we have encountered two thousand eighty five conspicuousexamples of the number three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That should not be possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask why, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are one hundred and fourteen people on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. Nothing in our survey suggests the source ofa parasitic infection. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was processing all of the information we have accumulated onRomulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we are to adhere to the exact letter of Starfleet regulations,then technically, sir, you have been declared a renegade. In fact, Ibelieve you are facing twelve counts of court martial offences. Youcannot give orders either, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How so? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nor do I. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Naturally occurring? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If it is harming you, we must return. Enterprise, respond. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are detecting a subspace carrierwave headed for the ship. Its signature is consistent with Bok'stransporter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, allow me. Please. Sarjenka, no one will harm you. These are my friends. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Using multimodal reflection sorting, I havebeen able to detect a complex series of subspace signals betweenLocutus and the Borg ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It may be possible, sir, but it would not be advisable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. According to my tricorder, the holodeck safeties havebeen disengaged. His weapon could be lethal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls forthe environment are, therefore, not accessible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sine I am not affected by emotionalconsiderations, I am closer to being Vulcan than human. However, whiletheir devotion to logic does have a certain appeal, I find their starkphilosophy to be somewhat limited. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You always did love the sky. A stargazer. That is what you are. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The possibility does exist, yet Gosheven seems unwilling toprepare for it. Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bridge to Transporter room two. Can you get a lock on the awayteam? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturallyoccurring phenomenon in the Newtonian sense. They appear to be alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, locate Ensign Ro. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If your intention is to make me human, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps if I looked for a suitable place to display it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it is worth an attempt. sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship appears to be regenerating. Perhaps this explains whythey have not taken notice of our presence. Their collective effort isbeing directed into repairing this vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most intriguing again, sir. The place that this vessel was firingupon was not the Farpoint starbase, but the home of those whoconstructed. Sorry, sir. I seem to be commenting on everything. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are very good with people. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have nothing to offer. There is not enough information uponwhich to base a hypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We know who you are. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believeit would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I can safely traverse the distance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could replicate one for you. Computer, please replicate oneviola. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Disease? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe, however, this situation is unique. Since the anomalydid not occur, there have already been changes in the way this timeline is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly bedifferent from the one the Captain encountered. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are ready, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The power surge would cause a system failure in my internalprocessors and melt my primary power couplings. However, there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would require construction and design specifications, fullorthographic representations of the Krieger equipment, as well asvisual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved. Butit is possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Quite impossible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far sideof Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But Counsellor, I do not have an ego. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Difficult to make a judgment, sir, based on the absence ofinformation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, prepare to transport me directly to the followingcoordinates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are here for the day, from the city of Rateg. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Activating power pack, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Everything available on a Doctor Noonien Soong. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a complete memory record of that day. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are making an unwarranted extrapolation. I was merelyoffering an aesthetic analysis of this particular model. The baseappears quite sturdy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Life support system, engineering and propulsion all appearfunctional. But there are no life signs, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, our sensors are being severely affected by the sunflares. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I observed that you seem to have an aversion toorderliness. But it was not intended as a humourous remark. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstandextreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No intruder noted by the sensors, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we are being too literal. I have recently learned in mystudy of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimesrepresent different aspects of the person who is dreaming. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you not wish to sleep, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so. What has happened? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, assume these symbols are pulsars. Translate associatedvalues into standard temporal notations. Computer, is there a pulsarwith a rotational period of one point five two four four seconds withinsensor range? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For the past several hours, I have been scanning the area wherewe detected the resonance signature of the Pegasus. From the strengthand polarity of the signature, it would appear that most of the warpcore is still intact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profoundfeelings while under extreme duress. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The power reaching those monitors has been diverted from theBridge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is firing on the <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The window is allowing intermittent sensor readings. There arestill numerous ghost images, but I believe we are picking up two lifeforms near the beacon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Adjust the invert two percent positive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, incoming message from DaiMon Birta. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is so noted, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She claims to, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And who are you, sir? Data to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you readme? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The wave is about to overtake us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds andimpact on the planet eleven seconds later. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. Mister Worf, activate the deflector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Counsellor. I look forward to our next meeting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The border outpost reports a contingent of seven Romulanbattlecruisers within sensor range. The Berlin has answered thedistress call. However, should hostilities erupt, both the outpost andthe starship will be out-gunned. It is felt that the Enterprise'spresence in the area will be a vital show of force. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, during our attempt to break away, I recorded a momentaryalteration of the movement pattern within the cluster. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am reading a temporal distortion ofmassive proportions. The ophidian is cap time-space continuum. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Doctor Soong? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are currentlyimpaired, but I will run a full diagnostic to make certain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, another forty-one minutes will seethe information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am scanning all seven planets of the Vilmoran system. Noneappears to support life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pardon me, sir. I am experiencing subspace interference whichlimits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Little is known. She was born on Daled Four. Her parents werefrom opposite sides in a civil war which has lasted for centuries. Theyboth died shortly after her birth. A Federation ship brought her andher governess to Klavdia Three so that she could be raised in a neutralenvironment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tending to your every need? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hear that? What do those footfalls tell you,Watson? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe that will be necessary, Captain. He is no longerin the drive section. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the containment field is beginningto fluctuate. Failure anticipated in <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You've constructed a positronic brain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need muchpractice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. However, the star's single planetfalls within the M-class range. It is capable of supporting life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to theexplosion, it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, if I am correct, the exocomps will not allowthemselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival, and theywill shut down before they will comply with the order. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have read them all. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound duringtransport. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will start my calibrations, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These are not ordinary nanites. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot become nervous, sir. However, I do sense a certainanticipation regarding my role in the wedding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One whichcommands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well? Opinions? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you seen many? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What did she train her cat to do? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Tainer, I get the impression you are trying to spare myfeelings. I assure you that is not necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Daily? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields have been automatically activated. Tractor beamdisengaged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenaryship. I believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinatestaken from their navigational system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I offer you some refreshment, Chief? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Bartender! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Imagination is not necessary. The scale is readily quantifiable. We are presently generating twelve point seven five billion gigawattsper <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One can swim in moonlight? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot say. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, drop the shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The warship is approaching from high orbit. It is very closethree hundred thousand kilometres distant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Universal Translator is coming on line,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I fold as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained from theshuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order toactivate the shuttle's systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What will become of the resonator, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The star is in sector two one four five nine. The Rahm Izadsystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My condition does not alter with the passage of time, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, there are no protostars in this sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am picking them up, sir, but I cannot identify the source. Theyseem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometreapogee. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ninety seven minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would take further research, but I believe to be effective onhumanoid crewmembers, humanoid antibodies would be necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Temperature in the reaction chamber has increased by forty sevenpercent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will try, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Baryon levels are continuing to rise, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A remarkable experience, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Borg are in pursuit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is something I thought you should know. My father told methat he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted nevertelling her how much he cared for her. I am certain he was referring toyou. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, but I will take your word for it. It is very amusing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth,that you really are human. Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forward thrusters have failed, sir. We are losing power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: From the Devoras. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The two-dimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitationalpull of the string. Their course is taking them directly toward it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friendsand family. I could access one of those. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am from the twenty fourth century, where you and I serve aboarda starship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do nothing. It may yet be possible to salvage the situation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we field saturate the nacelles, we should be able to sustainwarp speed for approximately two minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The fragmentation effect is increasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief periodeach day. I hope to generate new internal visions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a highly structured society in which people live by strictcodes of honour. For example, what Lutan did is similar to what certainAmerican Indians once did called counting coup. That's from an obscurelanguage called French. Counting coup <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Power conduits are ready. Is something wrong, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then he is questioning my ability as a parent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard theEnterprise that shed their skin in this fashion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Ferengi report their containment field iscollapsing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Everything seems to remind me of the nightmare. Objects, sounds,smells. And now I have seen elements of the dream in a waking state. Icannot explain it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I thank you for your sympathy, but she is here. Her presence soenriched my life that I could not allow her to pass into oblivion. So Iincorporated her programs back into my own. I have transferred hermemories to me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would like to get to know you better, Mother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm afraid I have no time to answer a million questions. I have amission to accomplish. I need to know more about your people, andGosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle has been hit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What do you wish me to do, dear? Am I not paying enough attentionto you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understandable. It has been extinct six hundred thousand of our of our years. Theseplanets were once outposts of that empire. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inthe game of military brinksmanship, individual physicalprowess is less important than the perception ofa species as a whole. For over nine millennia, potential foes haveregarded the Zakdorns as having the greatest innately strategic mindsin the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Rogue? Ah. Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain, wild element. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but it is all right. Do you need me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Captain, I am not certain I fully understand thisProspero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have thatwould improve my performance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As do I, sir. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate engineering problems. They're experiencing totalguidance system failure, with less than twenty four hours' reservepower. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is unfortunate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which you destroyed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But why do you ask the question? Since her death, I have beenasked several times to define how well I knew Lieutenant Aster. And Iheard you ask Wesley on the Bridge how well he knew Jeremy. Does thequestion of familiarity have some bearing on death? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The logs indicate Professor Galen visited an unexploredstar system, Ruah Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedbackmotivators. Unfortunately, I have been less than successful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. All of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three. It appears to be a focal point of some kind. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Watson. Pray continue, Inspector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My initial assumption was correct. You do wish to speak of yourmother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Beginning sensor sweeps. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was hoping that you might have another option, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are back on course to Endicor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him socompletely human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I may be of some assistance. Captain Scott is unawareof the existence of synthehol. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They have restored the servo link to thecore. We can begin downloading the database. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot say. The electromagnetic interference prevents anaccurate reading. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not wish to be assimilated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fortunately, Starfleet has no such rulesinvolving our second officers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it is standard procedure that the secondofficer accompany the away team. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are configured for planetary probe, sir. Ready forlaunch. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Firing phasers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starfleet reports <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am adding virtual particle trajectories. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There isonly one Juliana mentioned in them. Her last name was O'Donnell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you for your co-operation. 1 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not any longer, sir. The star went nova. All life in the systemwas destroyed approximately one thousand years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are in position, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To make the modifications and search the entire Devron systemwill take approximately fourteen hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Time, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A compound I made which will neutralise the particles that aremaking you ill. Swallow this. I must administer this to everyone in thevillage, but I do not think they will trust me after what happened toSkoran. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The structure is rhizomatous. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have uncovered several cases, sir, but wehave not yet completed our investigation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Twenty five centimetres in length. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no unusual activity in the NelvanaSystem, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My calculations indicate that its target is the house of Kevinand Rishon Uxbridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasicpulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The planet's proximity to its sun will create two additionaltransport windows in the next three days. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish to leave. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not consistent with what we know of them, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tomorrow will be your first day of school, Lal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I should not have resumed my painting? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hit me. Another please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor? I require your advice as a successfulparent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Klingon vessel is within range, sir. They are requestingvisual contact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Does this waveform match that of any known communication format? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been told that my playing is technically flawless, but noone has described it as beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be moving toward us, closing slowly. Its bearingindicates a possible collision course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is similar to our tractor beam, sir, onlymuch more powerful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could not have succeeded without your support and insight. I amgrateful for your assistance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances, butwe're limited by the equipment on the Pasteur. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is large. Approximately two hundred kilograms. It is heavilyarmored with an exoskeleton. Life signs appear to be Klingon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. I am not entirely certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, our communications are being monitored. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, these cubes are improperly balanced. I believe theirfinal resting position would be <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should consider the transportersystem. It uses many of the same principles as the holodeck. Both, forexample, are capable of converting energy into matter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be dead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is the third time I have refreshed your memory. Do you wishto rescind our agreement? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have only enough power to emit a hydrogenstream for that amount of time. They must understand that they willhave to detonate it immediately. Captain, we are ready to implement theplan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Mother. Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> DATA: The Brittain, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. She will not remember me, sir, but I will remember her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. The diagnostic of the transporter system shows ananomalous energy fluctuation. I will need to inspect the imagingscanner in transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indeterminate. Propulsion appears to employ a gaseous corefission reactor, but it is not functioning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How do you do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why are the backups not functioning? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They are warning the dead, sir. Beware, a Klingon warrior isabout to arrive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was not sent by your father. Our ship encountered a species whoappears to be threatening nineteenth century Earth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are approaching the Loren system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is. However, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I witnessed something remarkable. Individually they were both so <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack on the Vico isconsistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will see there are. I can even block them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most interesting, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I ask how you got here? 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two, prepare for docking. Level one precautionsremain in effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. If we draw <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I expected nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was that funny? Accessing. Ah. Burns and Allen, Roxy Theater, NewYork City, 1932. It still works. Then there was the one about the girlin the nudist colony that nothing looked good on? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors and secondary generators are offline. Life support downto sixty seven percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have found a quicker way out of here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems. Nointernal organs. Cellular structure unknown. It does not have anyproteins which are known to us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on ournavigational charts. However, sensors indicate the presence of anextremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Just as before, going to Worf first. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have found Holmes' methodology of deductive reasoning tobe quite useful. One of his adages is that once you have eliminated theimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Access faster. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Webster's Twenty Fourth Century Dictionary, Fifth Edition,defines an android as an automaton made to resemble a human being. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Five card draw, deuces wild. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites andgiven the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please show me the spectral analysis magnification twelve K. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The probe is composed of paricium and talgonite, a ceramic alloy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Matter-antimatter explosions appear to be ineffective, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire, where are you from? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Five minutes to launch site. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However,there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possiblesomething is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run acomplete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at thebiometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to takeover my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week. Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lestrade of course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All navigational systems confirm we are at warp six on course,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance it islikely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, therecould be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cellmembrane, but. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was attacked by another alien, sir. I was unable to prevent thepower transfer. It cannot be disengaged, sir. A core breach is againimminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: IF we maintain our current position, our shields should providesufficient protection. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I am now prepared to dance at the wedding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The safest and most logical decision in this situation is tocontact Starfleet and await further instructions. However, based onpast experience, I project only a seventeen percent chance CaptainPicard will choose that alternative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I said before, these are all images I originally experiencedin my dreamprogramme. I do not have a rational explanation for them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are through the perimeter, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is dead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The structure must be here, yet we cannot see it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The answer, sir, is that my loyalty is to you and Starfleet. Completely. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would not be possible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least several hours. But what I said was a statement of fact. Perhaps she will look it up. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That while I believe it is possible to download the informationcontained in the positronic brain, I do not think you have acquired theexpertise necessary to preserve the essence of those experiences. Thereis an ineffable quality to memory which I do not believe can surviveyour procedure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting theEnterprise, they are saving us six point one hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula. My calculations indicate the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabusystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. I am the only one. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you believe that we are in some ways alike, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no evidence of an advanced communication network. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There should be a doorway. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Quite true. I keep trying to be more human, and keep failing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be beyond their technology. Similar to Romulanshields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Initiating ionisation field pulse. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The neutrino stream is coming in strongly. Sensors are trackingthe probe despite the interference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have created twenty three individual illustrations in the pastsix hours, twenty seven minutes. I believe you could say I have beeninspired. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not possible. The onboard control systems for everystarship require a user code clearance. You could not haveinadvertently affected any of the Vico's systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Construction records show this to be almost identical to thatwhich Starfleet uses. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. We are unable to encompass the entire moon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Otherwise their course and speed have been constant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They're hailing us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have covered the area in a sphericalpattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the timeallotted. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If being human is not simply a matter of being born fleshand blood, if it is instead a way of thinking, acting and feeling, thenI am hopeful that one day I will discover my own humanity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tough? As in difficult? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We need only to programme the computer with details of thespecific ceremony. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am curious. What do my nightmares mean? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, what is the definition of life? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have received a subspace communiqué from StarfleetCommand regarding the young human, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you wish to leave orbit, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear that the starship which Captain Picard attacked,had in fact, been under a flag of truce. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accidentwhich claimed the lives of our officers. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Strange. The transceiver assembly has been removed. Without it Iwill be unable to track the time shifts. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One enemy target hit, sir. Moderate damage to their forwardshields. Our shields are still holding. Minor damage to secondary hull. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. I believe you and I have something in common. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulatingit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, but we have traced residual energy readings to a caverntwo kilometres beneath the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket ofour universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions thatare harmful, such as jealousy or hatred. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. I am now receiving a message from Starfleet Command. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirteenth Century, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A sensing device from the escape pod. It monitors the bioelectricsignatures of the crew, in the event they get separated from the pod. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Four point seven million kilometres, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors cannottrack them, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To go? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She is only two weeks old. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What was the source of your jocular reaction? What was it youfound humorous? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We proceeded to erase all evidence of ourencounter with the Paxans. I reset the computer's chronometer and thecrew was again stunned into unconsciousness, their short-term memorieserased. When they were revived a day later, the computer adjustmentsmade it appear that only thirty seconds had passed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: More than interested. Fascinated. One might say agog. But I alsofind sneezing interesting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I would like to remind you of our concert this eveningin Ten Forward. We will perform Chopin's Trio in G Minor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting other radio transmissions,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Lal. That would be confusing. We are taking you to theholodeck to show you several thousand composites I have programmed. Youmay choose from them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have no money. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not to my knowledge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you all right, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sneezing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then I saw you working the with your left hand. Commander LaForge is right handed, sir. A similar malfunction occurred in theSherlock Holmes programme I was running before Moriarty first appeared. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A Klingon fly, half the size of an Earth mosquito, with no stingand a buzzing sound like this. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shall I tell him, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Until then Commander Maddox, I will continue learning,changing, growing, and trying to become more than what I am. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> DATA: In all likelihood, the explosion damaged the Romulan cloakingdevice, causing it to discharge chroniton particles. I am detecting a chroniton field in here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallicpendant and hitting the cloth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is releasing what appear to be energyfragments, which are then ingested by the entities through the orifice. Perhaps some sort of nourishment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: By feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlierexperiences with the probe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. No effect. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We were incorrect, sir. I have determined that time is movingforward at an infinitesimal rate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, an unidentified <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She said I spoiled the joke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have noticed that you have not shaved. Are youattempting to grow another beard? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not sense the same feelings of absence that I associate withLieutenant Yar, although I cannot say precisely why. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will know in a moment, sir. According tocalculations, the next time effect will occur in one minute thirtyseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, select at random a mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,where I will play Sherlock Holmes and Lieutenant La Forge will beDoctor John Watson. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields are down. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the pod's life support system is failing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would you like me to discontinue, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There she is, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Onto the Borg ship from here, sir <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds, Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been unable to find a single interpretation of the imagesI saw during the time I was shut down. The hammer, for instance, hasseveral meanings. The Klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol ofpower. However, the Taqua tribe of Nagor sees it as an icon of hearthand home. The Ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have some vivid memories of sporting events. He played parrisessquares with a group of his schoolmates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. I must object to that plan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why was she laughing? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energising. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be a cosmic string fragment. Only one hundred sevenkilometres long. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: True. Nevertheless, it is possible that the phenomenon couldoccur in matter at much higher levels of organisation, given the properconditions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is theoretically possible, sir, but I am unaware of any priorsituations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetarybody. There may be unforeseen difficulties. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did it evoke an emotional response? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our current speed, approximately thirty seven hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. My readings indicate that it will fail in approximatelytwenty two minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood, compared to allothers felt by <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Freeze. Darmok. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will both be destroyed by the explosion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Those appear to be power taps. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg, I felt something. Ibelieve it was pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They're within transporter range, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarialsituation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. One electron circles one proton. This is ahydrogen atom. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from theleakage in the drive system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One seven three four six seven three two one four seven sixCharlie three two seven eight nine seven seven seven six four threeTango seven three two Victor seven three one one seven eight eighteight seven three two four seven six seven eight nine seven six fourthree seven six. Lock. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: To solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Expression of what? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know what to say to her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating gravitational <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I came to apologise, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My circulatory system not only produces bio-chemical lubricants,it regulates micro-hydraulic power. Most people are interested in myextraordinary abilities. How fast I can compute, my memory capacity,how long I will live. No one has ever asked me if my hair will grow, ornoticed that I can breathe. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With your permission, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engineering, this is Science One. I have just observed whatappeared to be a random energy transference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She would have to be armed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My name is Garvin? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you can see, sir, there's nothing there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed thirty four additional tests and the resultshave been the same in each of them. Perhaps I was wrong in suspectingthe exocomp was alive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would you teach me how to dance? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no indication of life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, link with the shuttle's onboard system. Access theisolinear storage assembly. Scan all chips which contain mission logs. Note any discrepancies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But they lack the ability to use it properly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We programmed the main computer to transmit the same opticalburst to all display screens, work stations and terminals throughoutthe ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My apologies. It seems my primary speech processors areexperiencing a minor fluctuation. I will have it corrected in a moment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor, did no one try to adjust their programming? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to these coordinates, we havetravelled seven thousand light years <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. That is not possible. The signals had to be transmittedwithin close proximity to the visor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uncertain. When he froze Lieutenant Torres on the Bridge, we hadour Sickbay to help thaw him out. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The bifocal vision aid is typical of the era. The weapon is aforty five calibre double-action cavalry pistol invented by ColtFirearms in 1873. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been watching Spot sleep. In the past fifteen minutes, hehas had twelve muscles spasms, which indicates he was dreaming. I haveoften wondered what Spot dreams about. His twitching and his rapidbreathing would seem to suggest anxiety, but Spot has never seen amouse or any other form of rodentia. He has never encountered aninsect, or been chased by a canine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was a very potent experience. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The plasma venting system has engaged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was never a boy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Delta evasion plan initiated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached theCardassian vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Joking? Ah. Forced to endure Risa. Your actual intent was toemphasise that you did enjoy yourself. Yes, I see how that could beconsidered quite amusing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: According to the shuttle log, the Enterprise was destroyed threehours nineteen minutes from now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it is located thirty metres below the ground,implying a cavern-like dwelling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hiya Doc. What's cooking? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These permutations are going to take a very long time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I do not have a mother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe I know Mister Whitley. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our scientists theorise the Lysians are using an energy wave,either plasma-based or a subspace interference pattern. The weaponseverely disrupts a starship's computer system as well as the mentalfunctions of its crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have completed my study on the atmospheric variations whichhave occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: External radiation levels increasing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Confirm. We are on that heading, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is this significant, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet,Commander. The dynamics of the radiation patterns <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Search pattern has been input, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is no larger than the holodeck, of course, so the computeradjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeckwalls <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The core breach has been prevented, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up something mostunusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be humanDNA. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indubitably, sir, Indubitably. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant? 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Timothy, androids do not lie. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ship'santi-matter, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is nothing to find. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Two point two milli-parsecs, bearing three zero at one four fivedegrees. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish frombackground noise. That is why I am boosting the power. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is Vacca Six in the Cabral sector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stand by to energise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lunar Five is a military prison facility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, permission to observe the interrogation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ten seconds remaining. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've got some information on its first transmission, sir. Ittranslates as stand by. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating transport sequence now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The theory is simple. The shield bends light rays around theplanet's contour, similar to the Romulan cloaking device. But theimplementation is quite difficult. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The planet's atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonicreactions are destroying it. The stratosphere is already breaking down. There are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface. Iestimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirtyeight hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All decks being probed in a methodical pattern, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have not fully assimilated its impact. I would prefer to studythe images further before discussing them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. I do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watchedthree holodeck programs designed to behumourous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire bysubjecting myself to erotic imagery. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have analysed over four thousand different religious andphilosophical systems, as well as over two hundred psychologicalschools of thought, in an effort to understand what happened. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Difficult? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Long range sensors detect a T-tauri type starwithin a pocket of the Ngame cloud. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of thestomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blotof mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. Why,there's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Humbug, I tell you. Humbug. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, will I be able to schedule a performance for the crew in thenear future? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: First neural connection is confirmed. I cannot report anysignificant access to the Borg consciousness. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. The bets will indicate of the relative strength ofeach hand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sakkath has been able, until recently, to usehis telepathic skills to reinforce Sarek's emotional control, thusprotecting others from the effects of his deterioration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the finallesson. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magicalrite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: All routes are equally dangerous, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have some doubts about the value of human customs in this. My brother! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If Lieutenant Worf resists, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Affirmative, sir. But the colony's principal interest was science. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid. Theyhave switched to their lateral sensor array. Beginning another scan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Another three hours twenty two minutes, sir. I can override it ifnecessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are still many human emotions I do not fullycomprehend. Anger, hatred, revenge. But I am not mystified by thedesire to be loved or the need for friendship. These are things I dounderstand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I amCommander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would care for something to drink? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I said I cannot operate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Theories, reports, but nothing first-hand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forty seven, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sound itself appears to have been real. However the acousticenergy does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voicecommunications sent at the time you heard it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: However it was well within operational limits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I need temporary lodging. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Excellent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Injector conduit temperature minus onehundred degrees Celsius. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Prime Minister, if you have the skills to create a mastersoldier, can you not contradict the effect? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you object to the question? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a possibility, sir. I recommend we run a level onediagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is thecase. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings. However, since I have none, I would prefer you to be honest. Anartist's growth depends upon accurate feedback. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is perplexing to me that the Ullians'ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized. If an event wereimportant enough to be recovered, why would it have been forgotten? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would you be willing to share your information with us? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Data to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the maskwas exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quitenaturally. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, can this be another me? Or possibly my brother? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a starship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, I'm aware of your interest in her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I'm afraid the contract could be interpreted in that way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. Although I considerthis woman's claim upon my ship to be an empty threat, it has furtherinspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Activating shield invertors, now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is present course, conn? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Did you help him with his research, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is at impulse speed. You are cleared for takeoff. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been monitoring Geordi's progress. It will be operationalin seventeen minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in Spot. Althoughshe does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer consolewhen I am working. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is true. Q's interest in you has always been very similar tothat of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is also a subplot about an older manconspiring with a younger woman to murder her husband. She issquandering her inheritance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Me. It's me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vesselpoint one two light years from our location. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is coming about, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I too. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Be a good fellow and answer that. Let's not keep the Inspectorwaiting. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have asked myself that many times as I have struggled to bemore human. Until I realised it is the struggle itself that is mostimportant. We must strive to be more than we are, Lal. It does notmatter that we will never reach our ultimate goal. The effort yieldsits own rewards. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have lost contact, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Crystalline. Mostly inert. Nothing to write home about. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I consider Geordi to be my best friend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Champagne? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes,several of which I fell victim to. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And yet you put yourself at risk. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The refractory metal in the rock formations may act as aneffective barrier. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not believe that is a prudent choice, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Are you all right, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the planet's troposphere is distorting our signal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hold position here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together, we willdestroy the Federation. And now, the conclusion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will speak to the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counterwith the el-Mitra Exchange, particularly since I have already takenboth your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your kingvulnerable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, we cannot survive another hit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is logged in his own voice, sir. Would you care to hear it,sir? Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I aminitiating Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot, sir. The transporter cycle has already begun. Captain's log, stardate 44668.1. Doctor Crusher'sresearch indicates that we have less than an hour before Commander LaForge's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts tolocate him on the surface have failed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would have thought a telepath would be more discreet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed weexperienced an intense sensor echo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ferengi contacts have been detected on both Selay and Antica,sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Could you describe feeling hostile? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no guarantee that Wesley will be reassigned to theEnterprise. Ninety one per cent of Starfleet graduates are not postedto Galaxy class starships on their first assignment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A type of weapon. Unfortunately it does not function in thepresence of hyperonic radiation. I will have to be innovative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I fail to understand why this is amusing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because I am a machine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engaging computer override. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enough? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Using conventional means, that would be true. However, I suggestwe piggy-back our signal on Romulan subspace transmissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Some form of passive resistance. Onlyeight were willing to consider evacuation. And of those eight <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but ratheras a message. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Too much to explain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was unaware of having caused any inconvenience, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I neither liked it nor disliked it. I simply had no appetite. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Q, I strongly suggest that you cooperate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Have you forgotten, Geordi, that my sensory inputs are notprogrammed to experience pain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. The subspace signal configuration is unchanged. What iscausing the increased neural activity is unclear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What's wrong with you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear the laser's drilling system was reprogrammed,sir. As soon as its memory bank received power, it turned itself on andwent after me. Fortunately, I was able to cope with it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am aware of that, Doctor. However, I can see no otherreasonable course of investigation available to us. And we may not havemuch time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That does not apply. I simply want to know what is funny. I wantto be able to involve myself in other people's laughter. I wish to joinin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, you do not seem to appreciate Ensign Tyler's enthusiasm. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is possible that it will take several days for Captain Picardand me to complete our mission. I would prefer to have a human presentto supervise the birthing process. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And Tasha did not? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are welcome. Doctor Crusher is expecting you in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, there is still one fact we have not considered. Theabnormal energy reading in the Captain's quarters was never explained. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are many things of importance. Some more than others. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony,sir. It is coming from the cemetery. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is something of an understatement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when weencountered it, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It remains unaffected here as well, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There he is, Commander. You were correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually there is a distinct difference between an android and arobot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energyreserves. Compensating. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We should be arriving at Earth in ten hours sixteen minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, message coming in from Tagra Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the particle fountain iscontinuing to surge. At the present rate, the radiation in the stationcore will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have a clear memory of my journey. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As Doctor Pulaski would at this juncture, no doubt, remind us,life is rarely fair. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These people have been fighting all of their lives. They knowonly hatred, suspicion, and fear. Even with myChorus, I could not have changed their attitudes in a day. We have achance. They want the talks to be successful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In effect, you have abandoned what I have sought all my life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi told me herself that feelings are not negative orpositive. It is how we act on them that makes them good or bad. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These are the two planets which best matchour search criteria. Draygo Four features an unusually large temperatezone. However, it is within three light years of Cardassian space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, what we just heard is impossible. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I bet ten. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded, sir. Without breaking the code, we will be unable to identify any specificFerengi vessel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, the computer will require the voice authorisations of twosenior officers in order to disable the safety routine. Will you helpme? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have confirmed Geordi's readings. The resonance signature isoriginating from somewhere beneath the asteroid's surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in thatroom, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Forever curious, this urge to compete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a starship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If they do not have a plan for this contingency, we may have theinitiative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was not sent by your father. Circumstances demand that I takeyou into my confidence. I require your assistance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a hypothesis. Thetwenty-second century physicist Pell Underhill conjectured that a majordisruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions ofcounter reactions. That effect may have allowedDoctor Crusher's mosses to arrive at the other side of the worm holewith the unanticipated growth. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Wesley, congratulations on passing your Starfleet writtenexamination. An excellent achievement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong, sir? Alone, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magneticcoils the freighters depend on. Assuming the malfunction is similar,suitable replacements can be fabricated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree with her, Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Please continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sever modified beams. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is not the correct port, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It seems that I must make a decision. Whetherto tell Doctor Tainer that she is an android or to withhold thatinformation from her. I do not know what to do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He wanted to. Every waking moment. And he wanted you to knowthat. You were everything to him. {Graves' body is in a torpedo case, wearing ashroud.) <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can. My orders were to search for abnormal patterns inStarfleet's directives. I believe I have found just that. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Clearly, Mister Fajo has no moral difficulty with my imprisonmenthere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I wouldbe happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience isany indication, he will need all the help he can get. Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performingfield tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. MisterWorf is supervising the exercises. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At warp six, fifty three hours, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: She does not feel the emotion of loneliness, but she can observehow isolated she is from the others. She wishes to be more like them. Ido not know how to help her. Lal is passing into sentience. It isperhaps the most difficult stage of her development. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The fusion reactors that power the array areextremely unstable. There is a high risk of overload. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, if we can get close enough to Geordi, we can read hisabsorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of all performers available, who is considered funniest? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And yours as well, Commander. She is listed as representing theBetazed government at the conference. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Except that we are still in it, sir. Captain, if we dropped astationary beacon and travelled straight away from it, we would have afixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Q entity, sir. It is identical to the grid we encounteredwhen <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Recheck analysis, please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sherlock Holmes programme three A has demonstrated some verycurious anomalies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They have little regard for human life. Thus, the most sensiblecourse is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of yourpeople. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Where none have gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41263.3. Instead ofreturning to our own galaxy, the Enterprise has gone forwardto a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our presentposition puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we will need to reach our transport site in fourteenminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanning. Vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are a challenging opponent, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The wave has increased speed to warp seven point two, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These quarters were obviously intended forone crewmember, sir. There is but a single sleeping space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. As I experience certain sensory input patterns, mymental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually areanticipated, and even missed when absent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He surprised me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you desire privacy, you may use the Observation lounge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor, I do not believe we can offer any guarantees. We cansimply make the best choice we have at the moment. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But he admitted to an alliance with the Crystal Entity. To gainits favour, he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed theEnterprise as well had I not <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would like that as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are functioning normally. They are detecting a subspaceparticle emission originating from within this room. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Massive power failure to the scout ship, sir. All systems aregoing offline, including life support. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavaladuring the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. Theywere both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Thetato Mavala and returned four days later. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I encountered him once in the Terlina system. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe the answer to both questions is no, sir. In a manner ofspeaking, it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock, a useless ball ofmud, a worthless chunk <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it upto be human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The cut off has been automatically activated. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Frequency-scan detectors engaged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. The Starfleet officers who first activated me on OmicronTheta told me I was an android, nothing more than a sophisticatedmachine with human form. However I realised that if I were simply amachine, I could never be anything else. I could never grow beyond myprogramming. I found that difficult to accept, so I chose to believethat I was a person, that I had the potential to be more than acollection of circuits and subprocessors. It is a belief which I stillhold. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your courtesy is appreciated, sir. But I am aware that I do noteffectively convey the fear called for in this scene. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe what happens on the holodeck has a directeffect on the ship. When we attempted to destroy the nodes, thecharacters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are detecting a ship, <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Drema Four has been enduring the same geological stresses we havefound in the other systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ambassador, you may find this of interest. These newly refinedsensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloakedwarbird even at warp. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration ofnitrium, and project it toward one of the asteroids. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Agreed. However, we may be able to learn something from theattempt. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There do not appear to be any unusual readings. Energy residualsfrom the plasma burns, the beginnings of cellular decomposition. I seenothing that connects these bio-readings to your recent sense ofdiscontinuity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Approximately one hour forty five minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would appear that Spot has had her kittens. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Animated presentation, humanoid. Interaction required. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One hundred thirty seven years, Admiral, according to Starfleetrecords. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probable cause of these variations? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you are correct, you are placing yourself in grave danger. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will findacceptable. Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is that a failing in humans? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: For any event, there is an infinite number of possible outcomes. Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theoryin quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen, do happen inalternate quantum realities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is true, Doctor. The contents of their logs and journals weretransferred into my memory cells. The man who created me alsoexperimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists'temporal lobes and programming them into my neural nets. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to approximately twopoint five million metric tonnes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I have completed level one computer diagnostics. There areno malfunctions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the moon's trajectory has movedpoint three percent. Point-four percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors confirm design and specifications, Captain. Analysis ofhull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methodsof that time period. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This vessel is called the Enterprise. We are part of anorganization called the United Federation of Planets. TheFederation is currently in a state of war. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by atleast seven percent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I found it, sir, two light years away. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. It is not that. I have reason to believe the exocomps arealive. Captain's log, stardate 46316.6. I have summonedthe senior staff in order to discuss Commander Data's theory that theexocomps are a life form. Doctor Farallon has attended onlyreluctantly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but not quite as perspicuously. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Here is the visor. May I ask why you wanted it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I see no way for you to journey with an energy form. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a formidable responsibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. The situation is analogous to understanding the grammarof a language but none of the vocabulary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I think he deserves some leeway. Overruled. But that will bequite enough, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, display the transport logs for thesequence just completed. Computer, what is beingdisplayed here? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths. Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Activate Bussard collector. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer activate automatic helm control. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The problem, sir, is there. Although they'velearned of the Prime Directive from my mind, how will they evaluate it? How do they reason? What are their values? Remember their warning tous, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am awaiting inspiration. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity. Itshould be possible to trigger the unit from orbit. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could be chasing an untamed ornithoid without a cause. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We meant no harm. We were exploring. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is too early to tell if the nano-cortical fibres performedtheir function. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have discovered, sir, a certain level of impatience when Icalculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second. However, ifyou wish <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate damage to the Dorian's subspace emitter. Audiocommunication only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Probe on course. Sensors are functioning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With practice, handwriting can be forged. It takes a trained eyeto notice certain discrepancies. For example, whether someone is rightor left handed! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, how long has it been since you've seen a physician aboutyour Irumodic Syndrome? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are now two kilometres beneath the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill downthrough the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up aseries of plasma infusion units. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is good to see you, too, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Enterprise to La Forge. What is your situation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. We must speak to Goshevenimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spotlacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses tomy commands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But if that is so, Captain, why are their methods so oftensuccessful? I have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and itappears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. I detect no reduction in the lifeform's rate of energy consumption. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have beenmapped near thirty nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred yearsalone, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I hope you find the performance pleasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. We would have to surround the core with a subspaceisolation field. It is not possible to generate a field of thatmagnitude from the runabout. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In the meantime, Governor, you should expect the weather problemsto continue. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Warp six point three seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ready, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will arrive in fifty one hours, thirty two minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fajo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleetofficers on the Omicron Theta outpost. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We did find that Wesley opened his coolant interlock just beforebeginning the manoeuvre around Titan. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But that would not affect the engines in any way. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a certain degree of random fortune involved. I believethat is why they call it gambling. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Firing shuttle thrusters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: How well did you know Lieutenant Aster? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Has Spot been misbehaving? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree that is a possibility. Captain, I suggest we ask theFederation Science Council to send a research vessel to this area. Amore detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. The Romulan Information net employs aprogressive encryption lock. I have been unable to penetrate theirsecurity measures. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lead where, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors are detecting a subspace distortion forming directlyahead of the Borg ship. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello, Timothy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot verify that hypothesis. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Were you prepared, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Three, sir. All gathered inside what appears to be the entranceto a mining tunnel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which would require extreme precision from the probe controls. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will be back. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating tricorder emissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not by choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are attempting to bribe me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, given the EM field properties of this moon, I recommend asearch pattern beginning in the southern polar region. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, I am. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have overexerted myself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've found them, sir. The door to theircompartment is jammed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It does seem dormant, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus. The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross theborder. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck thirtynine. Highly focused, very powerful but of unknown origin. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediatelyreturned to its previous dynamic. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern would imply amodified <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot locate the Enterprise anywherewithin one light year of the planet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I have ruled. Please sit down. You may proceed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, but we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the viewer, Captain. Unidentified vesseltravelling sub-warp speed, bearing two three five point seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: CounsellorDATA <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is identical to what happened to the outposts along theNeutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An accurate analogy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have seen that echoes, or after-images, from previous loopsappear as distortions in the dekyon field. We may be able to send adeliberate echo into the next loop. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have located that cavern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am the only one, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Vulnerable, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initially, Commander Maddox, I found it difficult tomaintain friendships, since human emotions are often puzzling to me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: When I stroke the beard thusly, do I not appear moreintellectual? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ejector systems are offline. Core breach is imminent <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is interesting. The water table is a thin ribbon between thesandy surface layer and the rocks below. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not intend to sit in the chair. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He seems most uncooperative. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On the contrary, dear colleague. On their return, they drewmedical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds andabrasions on these life forms. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct asearch would be consistent with the spirit of the Treaty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating pre-launch sequence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The test ship is maintaining at warp two point three five, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Indications of what humans would call a wild party? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are in synchronous orbit above the beamdown site, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So it seems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Obviously, I am not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We should programme the bridge sciencestation to vary the emissions we direct toward the Entity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Interesting metaphor, Doctor. What is your idea? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No life-form readings, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not with her hands, no. But with this. When usedas a garrote, these beads will leave marks quite similar tofingerprints. And, my dear Watson, you will note from the victim'sthroat, the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by humanhands. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planet'scrust. There is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whetheror not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Premise. The Ferengi wish tocapture the Hathaway believing itto be value. Therefore wemust remove the ship fromtheir field of interest. KOLRAMI <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The creature's anatomy appears most peculiar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We unsuccessfully tried fifty three different computationalmodels in an effort to simulate the movements of the Nova Squadron justprior to the crash. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You performed what Starfleet textbooks now refer to as the PicardManoeuvre. PICARD <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which do you believe, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Use it also to describe for the Captain the time you spent amongthe colonists. Including everything you know about what happened tothem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I agree that Tam's motives are trustworthy, and I do notbelieve it is possible that he will act against us, or will cause TinMan to act against us out of malice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Meaning the microbrains might be photoelectric. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The exocomp has replicated a different tool. That is not themolecular fuser it had when it entered the Jefferies tube. Doctor, theexocomp not only completed the repairs, it also deactivated theoverload signal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perform a level 5 diagnostic on the shuttle's power andnavigational systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not really, Inspector. And now, for strictly personal reasons, Imust leave. Come, Watson. This murder does not connect with our case. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Remember, Geordi, if the implementation is off by a millisecond <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, we might be able to <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will attempt to do so. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Politely, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ten seconds to stellar blast, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If it was a vision, I do not know how to proceed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I should escort the Doctor, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I detect no increase in the stress levels of the surroundingmagma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sarjenka, this is Data. Respond please. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The T'Ong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three. They are accelerating to warp five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not at all, Counsellor. You surreptitiously placed the edge ofyour left thumb against the card. When you divided the deck toreshuffle, you kept that card on top. You thus were able to have meeither save or discard, depending on the location of the card, whichyou followed at each step until we were left with just one. The card Ioriginally chose. Sir, I believe under the circumstances <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then despite whatever options he is given, he must be <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Class three defensive only. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Chief. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no sign of the freighter, sir. Weare the only ship in the area. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eight. Ace. Queen. The dealer receives a four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So far, my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred differentvocalisations. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Other evidence lends credence to that theory, Captain. A reviewof the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well withinnormal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show Captain Picard and the Tamarianin apparent good health, approximately twenty metres from each other. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello, Timothy. May I enter? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Uh, oh. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I would say Australopithecine. Each of these stages isanother link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to theorigins of all lifeforms on Earth. Because introns can include geneticmaterial from many different species over millions of years ofevolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations isoccurring among the crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ensign, whom do you suggest we speak to? RO <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The ship is strangely generalised in design. There is no specificbridge, no command centre. There is no engineering section. I canidentify no living quarters. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Admiral Hanson on subspace, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Possibly a great number of people, Commander. The interiorsurface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than twohundred and fifty million class M planets. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. Thank me? Ah! <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In what manner, sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One Samarian Sunset, made in the traditional style. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has stabilised. They appear to haveimpulse capability. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At maximum warp, in two years, seven months, three days,eighteen hours we would reach Starbase one eight five. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Eighty two percent dilithium hydroxyls. Magnesium,chromium. It should provide an effective screen against their sensors,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No response. Rana Four is emissions quiet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is no malfunction in any of the mainsystems, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of humanunderstanding often created social obstacles. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extremeshearing stress. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together we willdestroy the Federation.

 <bos> DATA: The energy field will eventually penetrate our shields. There isno way to counter the Paxans' technology. We can delay their takeoverbut we cannot prevent it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then we sat on the sand for some time and observed How the oceans that cover the world were perturbed By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead 'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you said. I began to expound upon tidal effects When you asked me to stop, looking somewhat perplexed. So I did not explain why the sunset turns red And we watched the occurrence, in silence, instead. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Paxans then take the ship out of their territory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from theplanet, sir, but I cannot pinpoint the location yet. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Establishing computer linkup. Interface complete. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Pleased? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is called a spoon. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starbase one seven nine. We are ready to commence transfer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have found one such phenomenon on the planet's surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Counsellor. I believe I will initiate a dreamprogramme now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The troposphere appears to be distorting our signals. It isfascinating, Captain. Klavdia Three and Daled Four have almostidentical atmospheres. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I could organise your closets for you. I have found that bygrouping apparel first by function, and then by colour from light todark, one can more easily find one's desired choice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Attempting new power subcommand path. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: These were all accidents. I did not intend <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven throughtwelve are exposed to space. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I was not aware he created other androids before my brother. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will attempt to narrow the field, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Angel One has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy. It isgoverned by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected Mistresses,and headed by a female they refer to as The Elected One. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One enemy target destroyed, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. It does not appear to have a skeletalframework or musculature. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears to be protecting itself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Increase magnification, factor one thousand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is entering a low orbit around Rana Four. It appearsit is preparing to fire at the planet, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is cellular peptide cake. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is precisely what happened to Lal in school. How did youhelp him? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No change in position. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is not reversible, sir. The subtle molecular transposition of <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This station is inoperable, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I made a leap of faith. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Anti-time, sir? PICARD <eos>
 <bos> DATA: An electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying outrepetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed. Computersare used to control, process, perform, or store <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Actually, the process of cryonics was never more than a fad, anddid not continue much beyond the mid-twenty first century. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Request complete text of all stories involving said character. Increase speed. Captain's log, supplemental. The Jaradan rendezvousstill is eleven hours away. I am about to reenter the worldof Dixon Hill, this time properly dressed. An experience like this ismore enjoyable when shared, so I've invited our fiction expert, Whalen,to accompany me. Doctor Crusher will join us shortly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I welcome the opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you recommend a way to counter the effect? Q <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. But once I have made a decision, it is your job to carry itout regardless of how you may personally feel. Any further objectionsshould be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. I do notrecall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with hisCaptain as you did a moment ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Heavy damage to section twenty three A has cut off access toSickbay. I have ordered a security team to bring casualties here untilfurther notice. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aah, ahh, ahh <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonise thisplanet, and are unwilling to share it with humans. If you are stillhere when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You know of the Sheliak threat. Starfleet wishes to evacuate youfor your own protection. Yet Gosheven has decided otherwise. That ishis right, And I will not waste time trying to reverse that decision. Iadmire your conviction in the face of certain defeat. Though doomed,your effort will be valiant. And when you die, you will die for landand honour. Your children will understand that they are dying for aworthy cause. Long after the battle is over, their courage will beremembered and extolled. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was forced to kill a Borg. I got angry. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And when you check, I believe you will find that this poor soulis the victim's common-law wife, who has been dreading the release ofthis a vile and abusive man. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Clearance is granted. The shuttle is under way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Hello, Kareen. Don't you think it's time westopped pretending? You know who I am. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As is the case with many natural growth processes, it isdifficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We will be in position over the drilling sitein three minutes twenty nine seconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I see your point, Captain, but at the time it seemed the properthing to do. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A highly respected scientist, considered a visionary, he advancedseveral time-related theories. One regarding the relationships betweentime and gravity was quite intriguing. But neither that theory nor anyotherreceived wide acceptance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In a sense, you were her grandmother. Would you like to practicenow? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat theproblems I was having with my systems as challenges to overcome, ratherthan obstacles to be avoided. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which will bring us to the colony in three point two hours, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is a fascinating hypothesis. How did you formulate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Their sun went supernova, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if theyhave been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across theentire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activityabove the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a stormsystem. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have not told Lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate. Idid not wish it to discourage her. Perhaps this was an error ofjudgement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They may have been attempting to eject their engine core. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I agree, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, this is intriguing. I have seenmalfunctions <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not find that concept particularly appealing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only a vague impression of some of my functions being tested here. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design asthe ships used by the Maquis. It is moving off. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. She was especially close to Commander Riker and LieutenantWorf. And to myself. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was inflight. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There is also no way of knowing if the Professor's ability toexist off the holodeck is permanent. It may be unwise to considercreating a second individual while this uncertainty exists. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they weremarried there. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Machine, Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I can find no other exits. I believe we are trapped here. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbitaround Theta Eight, still out of contact with the away team. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initial scans of ionisation patternscomplete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Only twenty-one percent of the time does he rely upon traditionaltactics. So, the Captain must be preparedfor unusual cunning. Counsellor, Commander Riker will assume we havemade this analysis, and knowing that we know his methods, he will alterthem. But, knowing that we know that he knows that we know, he mightchoose to return to his usual pattern. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Course plotted. Adjust pitch to twenty seven point three degrees. Set heading one eight zero <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at three <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have traced her comm. badge signal to deck seventeen, sectiontwenty one alpha. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. It was Tam's final request that I explain hisdecision to the crew. But I believe his hope was that you wouldunderstand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At present, I cannot. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, something is dragging us forward. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You were correct to suspect him, sir. But he is not from thefuture, he is from the past. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds to impact. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Precisely, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: After you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. Are they not here on Starbase? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative. But something similar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You will only harm Counsellor Troi's body. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I do, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself. Onceinside, we may be able to use the engines to create a static warpshell. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded inthis wall. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: External temperature is zero point nine million Kelvins andrising. Radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: While simultaneously, a small amount of genetically similarmaterial was left in the Ambassador's place. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At the last moment, I speculated that three might refer to thenumber of rank insignia on Commander Riker's uniform. That indicated to me that his suggestion might be the correct course ofaction. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would ask you to consider the possibility that what you see isnot real. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I must leave now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: And the German nation red, black and gold. The Italians green,white and red. The British <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But sir, Lore was responsible for <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothyremembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis ofshield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I am not capable of love. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I wish to cash in, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sorry sir, that did not come out quite the way I intended. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So you do purport to be the mythic figure Ardra? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It did not register on the tricorder. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Broaden search pattern beyond communications. Does the waveformdisplayed conform to any natural phenomena, cryptographic formats orlifeform EM emissions? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Second neural connection is confirmed. Istill cannot report any significant access. Proceeding with the finallink. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you mean a Tarellian vessel, sir, it is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up some unusualreadings from the Alpha Omicron system. At this range, all I am able todiscernis that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behavetoward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when Iappear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that anaccurate observation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I must compliment you on your performance thisevening. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It registers as solid, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You are correct. I did not anticipate your arrival until nineteenhundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Opening my eyes. Looking into the eyes of the Tripoli landingparty. They believed that the signal device sensed their presence andactivated me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Lysians have stopped transmitting, Captain. They are poweringup their disruptors. They have locked onto us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reporting as ordered, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivatedland is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few peopleengaged in agricultural activities. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gravitational acceleration is also increasing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during mypresentation. Was my poetry uninteresting? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Display sensor schematic. Display sensor sweep, maximum range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was shortly before his death. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Specifications on the vessel, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The only abnormality found during myinvestigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signalratio. Due to the circumstances, I decided to investigate thepossibility that a second transporter signal had caused thefluctuation. Although this was highly improbable, it was the onlyremaining theory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I know of no such logs. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What are you looking at? You, Klingon. Attack me. Are you afraid? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Was there anything else in the lab capable of creating this kindof energy discharge? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The Enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe, sir, that was the first timeoutsiders have witnessed the Klingon death ritual. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that anunlikely possibility. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have override control of her Bridge, Captain. All systemsanswering. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then you are trying to outperform the Intrepid. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Really, Grandpa? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of apast about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curiousto learn more about it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you feeling all right? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lore is no longer functioning, sir. He must be disassembled sothat he is no longer a threat. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have often wondered what it must be like to have one's mouthwater in anticipation of the arrival of a confection, or to feel thepleasure I have observed in humans as they consume it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At least two days, sir. The Corridor is over twelve light yearslong, and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensorrange. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, identify type of radiation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transversesupports. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our first encounter, the Borg virtually ignored us when webeamed aboard their vessel. Clearly they did not consider our beingthere a threat to them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There was a evidence of a delayed surface shock. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Geordi, the engine core is completely inactive. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, with all due respect, perhaps it would be better if youchoose another to serve as your First Officer. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi, what is it? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no rational justification for this course. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure andweakened the barriers between quantum realities. If he re-enters thefissure in his original shuttle, and emits a broad spectrum warp field,it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities fromemerging into our own. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, if you could explain <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. That is what I am trying to do, sir, but the solutioneludes me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Its size and composition match the probe which scanned theYamato, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will stay with you, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. Captain's personal log. Although Commander Data hasassured me that his odd behaviour will return to normal, I can't helpthinking that something went wrong during his visit to Gravesworld. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There appears to be a command path discontinuity. I shall attemptto rewrite the locator subroutine. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist withinthis nebula. After I have made further analysis, I may be able toadjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If you wish. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That may not be possible, sir. The starboard nacelle sustained adirect hit. Warp engines are offline. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Take Commander La Forge into custodyimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I have given you an erroneous impression. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal wouldbe permanently lost. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Ionic interference is too heavy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Intensified scan shows their guidance system to be perfectlyintact, as is their power generator. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Definitely human. Male. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You have told me no one from the village has ever been to theVellorian Mountains. How can you be certain there are ferociouscreatures there? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: On my way. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Based on the information gathered byCommander Riker's tricorder, we have determined that the molecularstructure of the alien life forms is solanogen-based. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Mister Scott. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have located the Vico, sir. The vessel appears to be adrift. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Tough room? A colloquialism meaning a severe, rigid,closed-minded audience. I understand. I will attempt to be an easyroom. Show me what is funny. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. There were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Apparently we do not. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Because of the dense gravity of the pulsar. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Energy output is negligible, sir. Radiation patterns no longercoherent. I believe it is dead, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: So he said. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have attempted to trace the message Remmick wassending. I believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. If you feel the risk is too great tosend Tam Elbrun alone, then send me with him. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, I find it highly unlikely that Danar would be attempting toreach shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The factions have been at war for fifteen centuries. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In many ways, Deanna Troi is the friendthat I understand the least. Her life and her duties are predicated onher understanding and perception of emotions. Since I have none, nodoubt she finds me as much of a mystery as I find her. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. All external sensors still nonfunctioning. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: They routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to locate them anywherewithin transporter range. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A mode stabiliser. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Some sort of scanning device, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Is it not true that had you refused to prosecute, Captain Louvoiswould have ruled summarily against me? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, Ithink the king is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as itdoth to me, in his nakedness he appears but a man. Therefore, hisfears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet no manshould possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,should dishearten his army. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the target was not the ship. The weapon was designed todrain the shields. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you, but what would be the point? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, it appears to be working. Theanomaly is beginning to collapse. I think that <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will call. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I had, sir. I will attempt to engage additional filteringelements. Visual re-established. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Exactly. That they were too engaged in their own affairs to havedisabled our ship and murdered the Engineer. Given a choice, they'drather kill each other than any of us. It's elementary, my dear Riker. Sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, I had read and absorbed every treatise and textbook on thesubject, and felt myself well prepared for the experience. Yet, when Ifinally played poker, I discovered that the reality bore littleresemblance to the rules. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Loyalty is not the issue, Commander. There is nothing wrong withCaptain Picard or the ship's logs. Therefore there must be somethingwrong with your original assumption. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Inquiry. You do not seem to be having as much difficultyadjusting to your current circumstances as the others. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in theE-band. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is a mystery, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me, but I amnot capable of returning those feelings. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fascinating. Your society is dedicated exclusively to theproduction of a single product. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Stargazer. Constellation Class. Starfleet Registry 2893. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The force of that explosion would destroy this cavern andeveryone on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: In orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark threefive nine, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The first months following my activation were a difficult periodfor me. There were many problems associated with my becoming sentient. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shearing force ninety two metric tons. Ninety three. Tractor beamis destabilising. Se are going to lose the barge, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Message from the saucer module, sir. It will arrive here in fiftyone minutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then it is better not to trust. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Holding, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are ventingdrive plasma. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: One hour, seventeen minutes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is unfortunate it cannot be studied. The resonator is a keyartefact from a remarkable period of history. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir,but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused anunusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have had one hundred eleven dreams since I first discoveredthis programmenine months ago. In all of that time, I have never experienced suchstrange and disturbing imagery. I believe it was a nightmare. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Should I pursue a relationship with Lieutenant D'Sora? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to be of help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors have located the transportship. Two Rekag battle cruisers are flanking it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps I am not giving you enough compliments? Your hair islooking particularly silky tonight. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Are you undamaged? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have encountered <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The satellite's trajectory is continuing todeteriorate, Captain. This orbit will put it within five hundredkilometres of the planet surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This one is empty. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Behind him and to the left, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. I would like to consider you my friend as well. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are anadvanced and most honourable race. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: What is the point? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We appear to be caught in some kind of energy matrix. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sorry, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have insufficient information from which to form a cogenttheory, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The pods are equipped with fusion-generated pulse lasers andminimal shielding. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have scanned the entire ship, Captain. Other than theEnterprise's regular complement, I can find no one else onboard. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Of course. We are ready, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There appears to be an unusual power drain in the EPSdistribution net. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I only wish to help. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Ah. Of course it is. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty five minutes toproperly configure the torpedo. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, I am detecting life signs from behind that door. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show nothing, sir, but it appears a moment in timerepeated itself exactly for everyone. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Gia, I would like you to accompany me to the village. I will needsome supplies. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Drop your shields and prepare to beboarded. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This is not a computer simulation? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I will honour our agreement. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir, you did not. I do not believe the Commander is acting ofhis own accord. He has been receiving E-band signals through his visor. Signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain. I havesurmised that Commander La Forge was conditioned by Romulans, a processreferred to historically, and somewhat inaccurately, as brainwashing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander La Forge, please report. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek ofRomulus. This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in whichPardek participated four years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The two radiation events aboard the Enterprise occurred fivehours, twenty minutes and three seconds apart. The science stationexploded yesterday at almost four times that interval. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readoutvariables <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have been told that imitation is the highest form of flattery. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We have lost one of the emitter circuits. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A Federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yet you have chosen a Vulcan way of life. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Reactor Nine will reach critical in ten minutes, forty threeseconds. The subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction alongthe entire length of the Array, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Data to Security. Send two officers toholodeck three. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is true I am acting on my personal beliefs, but I do not seehow I can do otherwise. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Scanners show no other life forms on the planet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He is still a fictional character, sir, originally programmedwith nineteenth century knowledge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With their orbital control station, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nearly impossible, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: At our present speed of warp four, sixteen hours, forty fourminutes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot access internal sensors from here. We will have to go tothe Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am an android, Mistress, although anatomically I am a male. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The field continues to drop, sir. Collapse is imminent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apologies, Captain. I seem to have reached an odd functionalimpasse. I am stuck. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: From the molecular configuration, it appears The aperture is beginning to fluctuate. I believe <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Apology is not necessary. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Their leader refuses my counsel. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Not according to their computer. I have also accessed Starfleetrecords. There is no doctor currently serving in Starfleet namedQuaice. In fact, I can find no service record whatsoever. There are nobirth records with that name. I find no <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Separate from it's control console. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth squarekilometres. It will take seven hours to completely scan the surface. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we have re-established exactcoordinates and attitude. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, the offspring is emitting high frequency radiotransmissions. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy intoradiation. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people. The onlytwo people who were with Commander La Forge all three times atransmission was recorded. Captain Picard and Ambassador Kell. One ofthem may be concealing an E-band transmitter. If they would agree to besearched <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Clearly, they unwilling to be transported into the stream fordetonation, although they may have an alternate solution. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander Riker. I am receiving a Code Forty Seven. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's specs into the computer and ran acontrolled test on them. There was no improvement in engineperformance. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That is an order. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I fold. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It was not painful? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I believe he found what he was looking for, Counsellor. Captain's log, supplemental. With all main systemsat least temporarily restored, we are proceeding to Starbase one fivetwo for inspection and additional repairs. We have had no furtherencounter with the Romulans. As for the whereabouts of Tin Man and TamElbrun, we can only speculate. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Which is the nearest Starfleet vessel? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Why was it not detected earlier? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I thought they were extinct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It will take the computer some time to give us a complete pictureof the anomaly's interior. I suggest we <eos>
 <bos> DATA: The bird did not appear in my original experience. This vision isdifferent. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A monk, a clone and a Ferengi decideto go bowling together. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the vessel being piloted by LieutenantRo is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you for your help, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we were expecting the Decius. There is no cause foralarm. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sensors show it to be an interplanetary vessel, sir. Class seven,crew complement twenty six. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interferewith our sensors. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You may leave whenever you choose. I will send out a message whenI am ready to go. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, that would place the ore directly off the ship's starboardbow. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I told a joke. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I must apologise for my inadvertent misconduct towardyou. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Human language gives me difficulty too, sir. Imperfect could meanI lack certain abilities he possesses. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain. Perhaps I should remain and further entertain our guest. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, you are needed on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Can you provide more information, sir? Seeking an instance ofsomeone showering in his or her clothing is <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are no longer at warp, sir. Impulse power has resumed. Allsystems show normal. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: A variety of crystilia. Their fragrance is an evolutionaryresponse to the acrid nature of the atmosphere on Telemarius Four. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle has reached the E region of the planet'sionosphere. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. You are constantly working on similarelectronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and moreimportantly, for her to interact with her crewmates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know for certain, but I believe it is during my creativeendeavours that I come closest to experiencing what it must be like tobe human. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, the transfer interface was not designed for thatconfiguration. It will take seven hours to make those changes. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanicsand exobiology. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, sir. Power emissions do not match any known radiationpatterns. We have not encountered this technology before, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Engaging force fields, Captain. Transportersdown. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With the Enterprise temporarily protected, I revived thecrew. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Boosting it? How? We will discuss thislater. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Unlikely, sir. Your collection has been confiscated. All of yourstolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners. Youhave lost everything you value. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Computer, initiate cascade sequence, accepting instructions fromCommander Data en route. Now. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: This appears to be the instrument Doctor Manheim described. Itshould confirm when the next time effect will occur. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Curious. There seems to be a problem in the holodeck's spatialorientation systems. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: It is here, at this doorway. A legal intercessor's office. Thename is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be one of his relatives. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented theEntity from <eos>
 <bos> DATA: But I am happy to do it. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composedprimarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over eightyseven million years old. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would recommend against it, sir. There may be gravimetric ormagnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower theengines of a shuttlecraft. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Fortunately we are only two days from Starbase four one six, andtheir laboratory can isolate <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I cannot say. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You asked to see me. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, we are approaching the designated coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would be happy to teach you dancing. I have programmed acomprehensive seventeen partcourse with some interesting holographic partners. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yankee trader. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, it is clear the Borg are eitherunwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain Picard was the person who first interested me in theworks of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I have subsequently become a greatadmirer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his ability tosolve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: That analysis is correct. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Do you also require the original logsrecorded during the attack, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I don't. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Worf, assemble your security team in Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. The Tamarian's bioscan is becoming unreadable. He maybe dead, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: There are numerous animal remains in the area, leading me tohypothesize that the vines could be predatory. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: We are receiving, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shearing force is at one hundred three metric tons. Tractor beamis stable. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, they were installed two years ago. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: He denies the logic of my arguments andspeaks of structures they have built. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: If I interpret your facial expressions correctly, you arepreoccupied with something unpleasant. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain, it would appear that the Romulan's intent is to contactTin Man first, at any cost. According to my sensor readings, thewarbird has exceeded maximum engine output by thirty percent. They seemto have irreparable damage to their warp coils. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I would not be in favour of that, sir. There are many things thatshe can learn only from me. My lifetime of experiences. The mistakes Ihave made and what I have learned from them. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: My programming may be inadequate to the task. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: As I have said, with further study it may be possible <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Priming the energy-transfer matrix. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Captain? Captain? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Sir, we have reached the designated coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Commander. I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasmareactor. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: You consider it important to please humans? <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I am picking up no vessels, no additional sentry pods. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: No, Commander. Overall exposure is less than seventy five rems. Very low intensity, more like a soft medical scan. I would speculate weare being probed. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: Shields reduced to one fifth intensity. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: I've lost the signal, sir. <eos>
 <bos> DATA: With the application of a little care, Wes, the paper can beutilised again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you all right, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Answer me. Where is Soren? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Minister, we've been attempting to contact someone in yourgovernment. It appears that you have detained two of our officers. Wewould like to discuss the situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know how many of them there might be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's move it! Out, out, out! Let's go! Everybody move! Everybody move! Out! Out! Come on, keep moving! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders. And I will do exactly that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room,sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should switch quarters. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all yours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this? You said death. Is this poison? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Uncertain. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps you should. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're ignoring us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forget the explanation! Can you do it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A concussive charge would blow out the security fields. We couldgo in with phasers on wide beam, stun everybody. Sort it out later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll tell him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our mediator is very self assured. We'll know soon enough if hecan deliver. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can that be from a planet with no people? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think you should reconsider. The warship has comeafter us twice. It could come back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They never seem to work for me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's in the case? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just one, sir. We could go down there and have a look. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need more than speculation, Mister Data. We need to know who,what, where, when and why, or we may be going to war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've established visual contact with the warship Q'Maire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to thearrangements. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. TheAssistant Chief Engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips fromcommand. All engines are offline. Wesley has hooked some kind oftractor beam to ship's power and he has it aimed at the door. We can'tget past to get at the computer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sick of this game. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. They can't fire when they're cloaked. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Chief. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With our shields in their present condition, we can't <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard made has some inquiries. He managed to get me aposting on the Gandhi. And considering how long I've been out ofcommission, it's an amazing opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here's your fifty. And ten more. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope it's enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The location of the Romulan bases along the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. I can't make you come with us. Are you familiar with one of these? We'll be in the system forthe next several days at least. If you reconsider, please contact us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's still bleeding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Preserving life, all life, is very important to us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think that's an option we should be considering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It could have been hidden anywhere in that room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, how can you look inside that, analyse the decompositionwithout <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the reason Odan refused the transporter? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One of them referred to himself as I. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, son, how are you? JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status, Mister O'Brien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A little over eight hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe you'd like to do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. O'Brien, lock onto Ishara and get her out of here! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What were you looking for? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then they'll be able to tell what's going on. Analysis, MisterWorf. What the hell is going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're a quick study. This is it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, our help is all they're going to get. They can't force usinto anything, can they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, activate security containmentfield. Deck thirty six, section fifty two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On second thought, Trent, we would behonoured to witness your moral imperative in action. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status of Borg power drive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's my testimony and it's the truth. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where's Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we stole a shuttlecraft, that would get us nowhere. TheRomulans could follow their own ship to easily. But if we broke intotheir communications system, we could send a message to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not now, Wes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Negative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the safest way around? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, that's how we're getting out. We're buying this place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know, but, maybe we went about it the wrong way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The ship is using a modified tractor beam tocollect vertion particles from the star. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Boost the confinement beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, belay that order! We want to get more insight intowhat's been troubling the poor man, remember? Quite a healthy fantasylife, wouldn't you say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One Klingon bird of prey off the starboard bow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have to ask you about your husband. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is gold. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. Shealready knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, I'm getting readings onTactical. Are we back up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, this way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will we be delaying our rendezvous with the Hood, sir? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drive who away, Groppler? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, get him out of there! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These symbols don't match anything in theFederation linguistic banks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Power up the photons, Mister Worf. Alert me when they're ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want you to know what really happened. It's all my fault. Iwas attracted to Soren. I pursued. I insisted. I didn't understand yourways until she explained them to me and rejected me. Nothing happenedbetween us. I ask your forgiveness. I behaved inappropriately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd better run a complete scan. Keep me posted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess you're right. It's not worth playing this game. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not suggesting you trade an entire star system for one man'slife, but you've got to acknowledge that these were Federation ordersand he is a prisoner of war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all right, sir, I'll see that he leaves immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Yes, there was a sound. Computer, there were noises comingfrom the darkness. Strange, like whispering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're too close. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why don't we wait and see who comes out on top. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're wondering what we're going to do next. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, specialist, what's our sensor status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Access your data banks under humour, subheading slapstick. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want to beable to pull them out of there at a moment's notice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi doesn't have several hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm glad we got you back, Geordi. We're going to need your helpon this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like my first year at the Academy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We tracked two ofour crewmen to this area. Do you know anything about them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about Captain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None, usually. This one's been fitted with two type-four phaseremitters. We'll use those to chart the null space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold position here until we can get our bearings. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. Medical assistance to the Bridge! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where did it come from? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Play? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It may be quite a while before the emissaries arrive. They'll bemore cautious after the last incident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you think that I? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any way to get through to them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure Captain Picard would have something meaningful andinspirational to say right now. To tell you the truth, I wish he werehere, because I'd like to hear it too. I know how difficult thistransition has been for all of you. I can take over for him, but Icould never replace Captain Picard. Nor would I ever try. Whatever theoutcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify hisfaith in all of us. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This one looks like you. Deanna, I have somethingon my mind. I had to see you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Estimated time to structural failure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Switch, now! Enterprise to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We didn't want to inconvenience you. We've made arrangements forquarters on the planet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you do less? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise, Get to yourtransporter pad and. No, forget about that. Lock on to any life formyou can find and get them over now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This guy knows all the tricks, doesn't he. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, locate Lieutenant <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Romulan disruptor fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One survivor. It's a Borg. Male,adolescent. He's badly hurt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which brings up the question of how do we get Junior off thehull once we get there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf. You said there was other evidence they wereinvolved. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hi. I'm sorry to just stop by like this but there's somethingI'd like to talk to you about. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are on the Bridge. There's a good chance this is our ship. Looks like you're the leader. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain this is incredible. We've entered what appears to be theBorg nursery. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lost sheep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, one of the things I've learned anything on thesevoyages, on this ship, and from you, is that most life forms act out ofan instinct for survival, not out of malice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't worry. We'll be out of here in a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Step inside the transport area. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Meaning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I had no idea it was such a ritual. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You look like you're packing to leaveforever. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Geordi, let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The treaty is the only thing that preventedthem from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What if he's an imposter? God knows we've seen enough of them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even you wouldn't be that cruel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long would it take us to get to the Kalla system? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Captain, if I may, I'll ask Counsellor Troi to lookthese visitors over. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're a logistics officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rocha's file is spotless. Two decorationsfor valour, three outstanding evaluations from his previous commanders. Doesn't sound like the same man that Lieutenant Uhnari described. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But it is prudent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you all right, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maximum impulse velocity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, maybe not acting is what causes the destruction ofmankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and youweren't there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A man more interested in Krieger waves than in a lovely womanlike you. How is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Already? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exactly the same as Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now more than ever. Deanna, facing death is the ultimate test ofcharacter. I don't want to die, but if I have to, I'd like to do itwith a little pride. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I have a suggestion. There's a piece of equipment inAdmiral Pressman's quarters under guard which might get us out of here. It's a prototype for a Federation cloaking device. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In all trust, there is the possibility of betrayal. I'm not sureyou were prepared for that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's get him out of there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Out, out! Let's go! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A judge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For thirty hours? It would never take you more than four. You'reincapable of that level of incompetence, Mister La Forge. Worf, wheredid you get that scar? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Commander Data was there, yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No help from their communications log. The Drake reportedarriving at Minos and then wasn't heard from again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So I've heard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what have you found? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're the one who said it. While we're at it, this isn't partof any human future. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think we're going to make it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't recall hearing of a Federation officer serving ever on aKlingon vessel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You should have seen the first two. It took a while to get afine enough beam out of the phaser. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That should reach almost everyone. Take a medical team to treatthe rest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. Starship Victory has arrived. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The scan analysis you asked for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll be a big hit in London. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can beam the table and torches down now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We may need the power from the saucer impulse engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shades of Gulliver's Travels. He actually meant it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shall we separate the saucer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But you're so sure it'll talk to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm just an average, everyday human who happens to be aCommander. Now, what were your orders? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Work, let's greet our guest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've decided not to pursue that commission at this time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That should have put our boy to sleep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your action could be interpreted as an act of war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Thinkhow many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here nowlike this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame? Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carrythe bitterness on another generation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the main Bridge, the command centreof the Enterprise and our last stop. Vash, Commander La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by. I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, Doctor Marr, report to the Bridgeimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looking good. I'll go five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Glad to be of service, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. It's a five minute countdown. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Riker here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the mostimportant. You may want to start with something like this. You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. Butthat might not work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whoa, wait a minute. We've got to coordinate our efforts herefirst. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status? Anything changed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought there were only going to be two of you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So we just sit here and watch our ship disintegrate around us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That could have just meant she was good at math. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twenty, twenty five minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, we have not even attempted a diplomatic effort yet. I would rather not use force until we've exhausted all other options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Full shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, you said I reckon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rivan, Liator. Also from our vessel, Troi. LIATOR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's suicide, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm going back for Captain Picard. MisterWorf, assemble an Away team to accompany me to the surface. Doctor, Ineed to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were going to mention something else? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't that a little risky? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are roughly two hundred people down here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I never knew any of that about him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I've never seen you quite so scared. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Barclay, what's going on? Barclay! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed, shuttle five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Allow us transport Lieutenant La Forgeimmediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Begin day watch. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't mean to be indelicate, but who's the father? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As we anticipated, the blast burned out ourmain navigational deflector. We also have damage to our shields and ourreactor core. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll return to the Enterprise and consider your proposal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And in order to do that we're going to have to go down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just needed some air. I can only take so much of these socialfunctions, and then I need to breathe a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep us informed. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're on our way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gin'tak? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage evacuation procedures for those decks. Geordi, we'regoing to need power back soon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's got us there, Captain. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're still here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Allenby, set a new course. We'll take it through the asteroidbelt ourselves. One quarter impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding, his bad disposition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's, that's not what I meant. I was sick when it happened. Iwasn't responsible for what I did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's out of his mind! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't accepted the assignment yet <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Heavy metals? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cargo has been loaded and is secure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean there's something even more remarkable about you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How about, until next time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another child? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Assuming any of the survivors made it this far. Admittedly, it'is the closest planet to theOdin, but to travel distance we did in two days at warp one would havetaken the Odin escape pod five months. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It wasn't here before. This must have just happened recently. If we have to repair this conduit, we won't have time to access thatcomputer core. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, do you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You won't need that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No bother, Doctor Bernard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, I think I'll stay and give her some help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Empire knows that we'd never allow them to maintain a basewithin the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I could get used to the idea of a Ferengi ensign, but AdmiralPicard on a Romulan warbird? What is that all about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any request? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again in a fewdays, and I wouldn't be in as good a mood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wes, remember our purpose is to improvise,RIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go to work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the engines can't handle the strain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A Borg footprint? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wish I knew what to tell them. Mister Data, can we stop theseincursions? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will somebody please get that! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! No, don't! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cause? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's panicking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase shields to seventy five percent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It certainly will. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Luisa, it's very beautiful. I could arrange for you to see it ifyou like. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, put us back on course. Let's stay at impulse for now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First time navigating through a globular cluster, Ensign? Youhave got to compensate for gravimetric interference before <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, we are approaching the Neutral Zone. Reportto the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how long will it take to get it all ready? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have trouble believing it myself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you like me to leave you two alone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's full of energy today. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I have an idea what the rules are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. What's your estimate on the engines,Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what about the Romulans entering the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Venom all over the ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tried to tell who? Damn it, Data, what's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wonder how many of the crew are buried back there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the more aggressive and dangerous they become. I think it'stime we set some limits. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then ask me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well of course. Think about it. A blind man teaching an androidhow to paint? That's got to be worth a couple of pages in somebody'sbook. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. Part of this mission is diplomatic. I have requestedan audience with a head of state, and I will honour her by wearingindigenous apparel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, they're going to have to adjust. Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rather a nice run of luck, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's odd. Hail them. I'm Commander William Riker from theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Barclay! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think it represents? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're scanning Sector twenty one five oh five now. There's stillno sign of the Phoenix. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. Your message said you'd suffered a failure in yourengine core. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tasha, you and the Counsellor. And, Geordi, I want your eyesdown there. You and I will start with topside. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Ral? You either had very good instincts, or foreknowledgeof the Caldonian withdrawal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Uncertain. The signal was interrupted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That probe is doing something to him. Anything yet, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Guinan, if they were that aggressive, why didn't the Borgattack? They could have but they didn't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I never thought I'd see you again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll stay here. I'll be finished by the time the third windowopens. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He could have killed you. He didn't. Maybe the end begins withone boy putting down his gun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain T'Jon doesn't sound like he cares one way or the other. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Beam us up. Now! 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are your replicators? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twelve decks away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you tell what's there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not that I can remember. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Placing beam-out marker. Return transport, fourteen minutes,forty seconds. Is your view any better, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. I have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, believe me. This has been a terrible mistake. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Move over. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That was his plan all along. First officer's log, supplemental. We arecontinuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escapeof the Angosian prisoner, Danar. He is still at large. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the nature of this trade? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready phasers. Prepare to return fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From the history of my forebears. Yankee traders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the Enterprise. I am Commander William Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But I think I'm about to find out. Stand by. What shall I call you? Ethan? Jean-Luc? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right behind you. Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6. We are on a longreach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which hasyet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the timeto further detail the charts of this region. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, bring her round one hundred and eighty degrees. Geordi,get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recommend we set the Enterprise on an intercept course in casehe needs emergency assistance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Speak softly, Governor. Those who cannot hear an angry shout maystrain to hear a whisper. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll have to lower shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't the containment field hold? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you doing up there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But for now, stand by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just as you should, Captain. Ensign, evasive pattern, RikerBeta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going back there alone. I want you to get the Enterpriseinto the Neutral Zone before it's too late. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've trying to scan it, but it's we're running into lot ofinterference. It's going to take some time. JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, are you abandoning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bajorans again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was strange. I felt as if he didn't even recognise me,although I was with him just the other day when I supervised the tuberefit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just a little misunderstanding. I was just clearing these peopleout of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, probably true. She'll be difficult to forget. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Data, analysis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Susanna, report. Fan out. Let's find her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't carry money. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps they have run out of people to kill. In any case,whatever the reason, peace is now preferred,which should make your job easier. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't see anything through here. Theunderbrush is too thick. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Especially in matters of love. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't that familiar to me. Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The colonists are all on board, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could ride it through the rift and thenbreak away once we're clear. That is, if we survive the ride. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, when you get involved with another person, there arealways risks of disappointment, of getting hurt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lavelle. Something I can do for you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Activate security fields decks eight throughfifteen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just a little weak and light-headed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's that important? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But if you do anything foolish before that inquiry. it's notgoing to look good for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've lost port thrusters <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come. Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Check and mate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't forgotten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is Mister Barclay? It's past fourteen hundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get that man off the Bridge, now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll talk to him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've traced the shuttle's energy signature to this point on thesurface but there's too much interference to scan the location. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have enough for twelve bars of latinum. I'd be glad to returnthem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know Data's been doing considerable research on Doctor Soong'sbackground. Let's be sure. Wesley, would you look in on Commander Data? Discreetly? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Over here, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know this is all very confusing to you so I'll attempt toexplain. You are on the starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you remember how we all felt when Tasha died? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fascinating, the advanced materials used in constructing thisspace station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I've heard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will arrange for a technician to help programme your recipesinto the computer. Of course, I'll have to try some of them. What'syour specialty? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn, you are ambitious, aren't you, Shelby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I'll leave that to the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When I sat down at the console, it triggereda response like I had been trapped. I had to get out of there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To sleep? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's why I'm here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How far does this game go? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you want to take her into orbit, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a littlelater, sir. Right now, gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and Iwill tell Lieutenant McDowell about the probe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm going to head for those trees overthere. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That won't accomplish anything, sir. There's no way they cansave Narendra Three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Terrific. Find the Captain. He's in the Holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you're saying there's a connection between the radiationbursts and the explosion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course not. Pull up a chair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks for letting me sit in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're some kind of magnetometric guidedcharges. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The transfer's been complete. Doctor Pulaski is being shown toher quarters. We're ready to get underway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right away, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't expect to fight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And my job is to see that this ship runs smoothly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, the unexpected is our normal routine. Hold it steady,Wesley. Ready to link up on my command <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: More basic than that. What was he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold off. Impossible, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor fromthe planet Brekka, and T'Jon and Romas from Ornara. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does it appear to have all your parts? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It comes down to this, Captain. We've learned everything we canfrom here, and we are no closer to understanding it than we were twelvehours ago. Manheim is unable to help us, but hopefully, having been agood scientist, he kept notes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standing by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've all been here before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'm not an alien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, I don't know, Guinan. They paid us a visit. It seems onlyfair that we return the courtesy. Captain's log, supplemental. We have been attackedwithout provocation by an alien race which Guinan calls the Borg. Itappears that we have neutralised their vessel. Commander Riker isleading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jenna knows that and she has obviously decided to take thechance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's not likeanything you've ever experienced. The rewards are far beyond simplefriendship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is my duty to inform the Captain we believe he may be undersome kind of alien influence which may constitute a danger to thisship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The pain's gone. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She needs our help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's the specs that Kosinski sent us. In my opinion, sir,they're gibberish. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it in control of you, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Move us to within forty thousand kilometres. Match velocity. Commence arming sequence. Increase deflector modulation to upperfrequency band. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What a perfectly vicious little circle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, you're right, Data. The ship's computer would be moreefficient, but it wouldn't allow for the subtlety needed for greatcooking. It would give you all of the ingredients in pre-determinedmeasurements, but wouldn't allow for flair or individuality. And Data,as we both know, flair is what marks the difference between artistryand mere competence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Believe me, it is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why not Dixieland? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There has to be. My relationship with Soren is not trivial. She's very important to me. It's my fault that this happened. I have tohelp her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? Captain, are you all right? Captain, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any other way around? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go take a look, fast! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What brings you so far from home? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A wormholes is there one moment, and then gone the next. Astable wormhole is unheard of. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This just isn't you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data will need access to your library. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Blood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can give it one more try. More than that, we won't haveenough power to get ourselves out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's probably nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Impossible. What about the fire aboard the Stargazer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we need to shut down the particle fountain. What if wedetonated a low yield photon torpedo within the particle stream? Wouldn't that shut it down? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak consider humans a lower life form. They would haveno compunctions about exterminating the intruders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: one seven zero one D Enterprise shuttlecraft five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, I was <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. Set course for the Devron system, maximum warp. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The next time we saw you, you asked me to join the Q Continuum. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Commander Data, you have the bridge. Ensign Crusher,you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Resume previous course and speed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am your worst nightmare. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm on my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Congratulations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yourself, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They'll only be vulnerable for an instant as they becomevisible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we may not be able to get control of this situation. Irecommend we arrange transfer of all non-essential personnel to thesaucer section. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very clear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Backed by Romulans? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See if you can trace and locate Bok's ship. Geordi, are youready down there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away, so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not going to make it that easy for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That must take some of fun out it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I'm right, you're not really here. This isn't a real phaser. It's all a fantasy, and I'm going to end it, no matter what it takes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Allenby, set a course for the Gamelan system. Warp six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Weigh it against the prospect of war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold out your hands. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He'll need another thirty seconds before hecan restart. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're right. It's difficult. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're lucky we didn't end up half way across the galaxy in themiddle of next week. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, we need a solution and we need it now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly thinks its going to be tight. Let'shope he didn't take us too far off course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, contact Dulisian Four and confirm this distress call. Ihave a feeling it may prove to be a false alarm. Mister Worf, how long before we intercept the Vulcan ships? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, yes, but not until later when he came back into the roomwith his little sister. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I wasn't aware you wanted to be informed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They'll learn and adapt. If Danilo Odell's any indication,they'll be running this place inside of a week. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for this. You release the command codes andwe'll talk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Maintain <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commence rapid fire with all weapons on full. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I checked into her record, too. Her last posting was on DeribenFive. I spoke to her commanding officer there. He said she wasargumentative, quick to take offence. He also told me he transferredher to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts. Tobe honest, I'm having trouble believing her story, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It'll hit the colony in less than fiftyminutes. Ensign, make sure you maintain a continuous transporter lockon all away team personnel. We may have to pull them out in a hurry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In our society, we share the responsibilities and the pleasuresequally. Which is why I am able to be here with you while the women ofthe away team go to find Ramsey. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Step away now. Medical Officer's Log, supplemental. CommanderMorag and Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept under close observation. Sofar, no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, we haven't been able to raise them since the initialcontact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. I can barely keep my eyes open. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With your permission, I would like Acting Ensign Crusher aboardfor educational observation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cancel inquiry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We should be. We're on a reverse course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,Chief? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed to second phase, Commander Shelby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is now. You're about to commit a murder. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For following my orders so precisely,Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But I assume you could revive us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's not much damage. It doesn't look like they wereinterested in the station, just the people. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You will lead it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm looking forward to reading your report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Belay my previous order, Mister Data. Therewill now be only three to beam up. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me get this straight. You think this thing was alive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have we got a fix on her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Evidently they're being held hostage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The triolic levels are as high as they wereon Devidia Two. There's no indication of a control mechanism. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Grissom is near the Sigma Erani system. I'll alert them tostand by in case we need more hytritium. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people, but we must haveyour answer within eight hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course I know who I am. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theUSS Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. CRUSHER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, secure Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Negative. There's no indication that he's left the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We may already be too late. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Terrified? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is not a Klingon ship, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's part of life in Starfleet, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Better than I am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That makes me even more curious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get her off the screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just like the Ferengi ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer. Locate Lieutenant Barclay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow usout of the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I want to remember that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nobody has suggested removing the Captain from command. Rightnow, all we have are suspicions. Not enough to act upon. The next moveis his. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our first move will be shut down the engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were able to open the probe and examine it. Apparently,whatever had locked onto you must have been self terminating. It's notfunctioning any longer. We found this inside. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Have you been able to contact Deep Space Nine? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're clear of the nebula, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. I hope I showed some promise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When the train comes in, everybody rides. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In the interests of diplomatic relations,I'll remain here with Mistress Beata while you conduct our search. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, this is Minuet. Minuet, Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so. But hehas not been showing any overt unusual behaviour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our new captain doesn't waste time. It's a good idea. Thank you,Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the ultraviolet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, The Enterprise reports a possible location for MisterRamsey and the other survivors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what Riker might that be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No wreckage was found, so Starfleet officially declared the shipdestroyed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't know that the exocomps are life forms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you found anything that might give us some insight intowhat happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and Counsellor Troi are completelyqualified. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am Commander Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Wewill evacuate you and give you medical care. You will not be harmed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could it have been a Klingon disruptor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Toxic? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can we do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How would Starfleet judge me if I didn't? An entire Earth colonydid disappear down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll have to move fast. If we need to stun one of the guards,the Borg will know right away that he's been hurt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could confine him to his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, from what I've seen of our guests, there's not much toredeem them. It makes one wonder how our species survived thetwenty-first century. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been known to tell a joke or two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I think she needs supervision. She takes the initiative alittle too easily. Sometimes with risks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An interesting choice. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Once we realised that you were no longer onthe mercenary ship, we scanned the surface for your neural implant. Wetracked the signal into the caverns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I doubt if they were there for the climate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any indication to how long we can keep them like this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will the transport window be open? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Assuming you can, can you regulate the reaction? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure Belt. Heavy concentrations ofhyperonic radiation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Repulse, this is the Enterprise. We are getting underway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Into the asteroid? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. Come in, Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You come from a very brave and unique people. I'm glad you'rewith us on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With this power drain we can't delay. Now, I'd like someadditional help in case we run into trouble. Can you spare Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Suggest it would be safer, sir, to have the Ferengi herewhatever happenings. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam andfiring on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm bettingthey're not going to push it that far. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's find a turbolift to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The hotel gets bought? By whom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With this new extricator, sir, we caneliminate three more bulky machines from cargo space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley, this meeting is not for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Subversion? Personally, I don't believe this conspiracy theory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know, Data. I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Clear the cargo. Beam it to a hold. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. we're going to need to do a room to room search. Worf, you and Corelki start searching the north wing. You and I willtake the south. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait. I don't understand replicative fading. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. We're having difficulty getting a fix. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The warp reactor core? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we compensate? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Poker? Is that a game of some sort? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Captain. You're wanted in the lounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll be in position to use the tractor beamin less than an hour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is the planet's distortion field re-phasing sooner than wepredicted? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And this is Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's one hell of a thunderstorm. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try the oskoid. Very different. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll have our Chief Engineer show you to his Engine Room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A rare and valuable object? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How the hell did he manage that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it was part of the table. It was here. It was right here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on theirplanet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not our position to interfere in the domestic affairs ofother societies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had planned a ship's concert this evening. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about Risa? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are some residual traces. It seems there were emissions upuntil a few minutes ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd be glad to show you to your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take him to a detention cell, Mister Worf, and notify Starfleetthat we'll be dropping him off at Starbase two one four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need help. I don't want to be at the mercyof these hallucinations any more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi! Geordi! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It would be more accurate to say he was discussing them with me. He's the best barber in Starfleet. What can you do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we'll be arriving at the BorgolisNebula in three hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're picking up a signal, coordinates twoone one mark six one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're out of line, Mister. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excellent. Doctor Crusher, meet us in Transporter room siximmediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Caution? What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hail the Yridians. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exit Holodeck. You do this every day? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An experiment, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have never seen humanoids with that power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was thinking the same thing about you. In all my dealings withKlingons, including our Lieutenant Worf, the thought never occurred tome of Klingons laughing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I never fired a phaser on the science station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rice! Where did you come from? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You couldn't see two metres in front of yourself down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Eternity never looked so lovely. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've lost our link, Captain.   <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reduce power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm asking you to leave, or I'll <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could you be more specific? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She could be a fake. We told him a member of our crew was fromthe colony. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As per report, sir. Class M, Earth-like, beautiful. It willstartle you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You just have to know how to talk to him. Orton, I think we needto discuss the situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then devise one, fast! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But the holodeck can't create anything dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There'd be no harm, would there, if I gave them something I knowthey'd like? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time? Not possible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from aCardassian planet near the border. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Until? Would you mind going over that again? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who would cause devastation on that order? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. I'd better go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. One to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you say so. I don't remember the old Geordi having that muchsuccess with Miss Christi Henshaw. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, damn it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their advanced technology could provide no solution. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I'm a little confused. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Out of range? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why wouldn't I be comfortable? They're waiting on me hand andfoot. I hope that they don't find out that I'm faking it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. After I've served for six months, I'm eligible tobring family aboard. If we got married <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think that deserves some kind of explanation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: T'Pel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We would like to get out of here. Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain from First Officer. They're finally sending amessage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Apgar, I'm Commander William Riker. Lieutenant CommanderGeordi La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it's all right. Come on in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering ourbread a little. He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer. I'veexamined Barclay's psychological profile. He's a history of seclusivetendencies. It was noted at the Academy more than once. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When we saw it this time, he seemed to be struggling, fightingit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's on your mind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what's our best bet for cover? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me for being a little confused, Setal, but I thought youwere defecting. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, have you decided where you're going yet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got to tell you Geordi is not at all optimistic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not now. When it doesn't interfere with myduties, Remmick. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know you're on vacation. Probably like to sleep and spend sometime on the holodeck. But if you're so inclined, we could use your helpwith the Phoenix Cluster survey. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities given thecircumstances. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, Mister Data, warp speed, please. Just in case Taris'sengineer is not as efficient as our Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Belay that order. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open a channel back here to Doctor Ja'Dar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, this appears to be a basic training ship. Five boys,all teens, all wearing uniforms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were with Penthar-Mul when he died. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Resting in his quarters after ordering both of you to your dutystations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know the inquiry's just a formality, and Captain Picard willdo everything he can for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well why don't you turn it off? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's teasing. He wants us to reveal our tactics on his terms. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Co-ordinates? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: American. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, yes. Absolutely. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't have a sword. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rather than let them be taken prisoner. Stand down Red alert. Mister Worf, advise the Klingon ship to signal us as soon as CaptainPicard and Data are safely aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going alone, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'd like to move the generator back to the Enterprise forreplication. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's toward Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know this one? Twentieth century, Earth. Maybe I can teachyou a lick or two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Ensign, set your course for Solais Five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not much on pleasantries, is he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That our computer was daydreaming? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Belay that order, Lieutenant. There's no time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I always will. Even when you're old and grey. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we areexploring the unknown. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't a Federation ship. These wallsaren't tritanium. It's close, but it's material beyond our technology. Let's get to the Bridge. There's got to be an answer to all of thissomewhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All we need now is power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought Commander Data's expertise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf? Anybody? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's very healthy. Helps to keep you warm on cold Alaskannights. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our missions are always inherently dangerous, and any of uscould be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Classified? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't matter. What I was saying was I'll be damned. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have my word. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off theplanet instead of me, don't you think he would have made the samechoices that I made? I just don't want you to be hurt again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter Room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you nailed down our little hiccup yet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll have you back at Betazed in plenty of time to meet up withthe Academy transport ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twin brothers? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Joret will attempt to talk his way past the patrol. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What can we do to stop the overload? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain's log? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cause? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you thatregrets what you've become. Listen to me. You don't have to do this anymore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll try not to take you literally. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You heard me? I heard you. Transporter Chief, where do you showus over here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That doesn't mean his life is over. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your head is not an artefact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twenty three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it was dark. I couldn't see beyond the table. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If the entity decides to attack again, the Captain may be facingit alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Who did you intend to send, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: AcknowledgedRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's worth a try. I'll check the replicator activity logs. Eighteen hours is a long time to go without food. Or without someoneseeing him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, I need those shields! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Federation Starship Enterprise. Ensign, call security. Iwant an escort for this man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, that large mass to port may contain an assimilator. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Verify these are accurate coordinatesfor New Providence colony. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! No, don't! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can't you think of some excuse to get out of it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Number and type of ships, Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I admit we withheld modern technology from some worlds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It wasn't. There was a computer time lag, for one thing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you going to answer that, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a lot to discuss. Can't we be reasonable? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Once we restore the servo link, you canshunt the database up to this console. Are you ready, Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeckthree. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good work, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've disabled the system temporarily. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you know that's impossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shelby, report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But how do we get to it? I wouldn't want to try to transportthrough that much solid rock. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why am I here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you remember the route you took to return? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So that's what this is all about. What did you do with thescience team that was on the surface? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's do it. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm fine. You look a little tired, Doctor Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Still four members of the crew unaccounted for. Did you come upwith anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. I suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the Array. Wecan begin downloading their imaging logs, find out what the Array'sbeen observing for the past six days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you said the Enterprise was faster than this Romulan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think not, Mister Worf. It's just a piece of space debris. Ifwe hadn't sitting here waiting for the Captain, we wouldn't havenoticed it. Leave it be. Let nature take its course. How long untilCaptain Picard returns? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby, take an away team and confirm that the Borgare asleep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Climb! Come on! Climb! Climb! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Position report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? I feel fine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it served your purpose, yes. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to transporter room one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering EnsignSito. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, one of the specimens is growing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. Take us out of orbit, Ensign Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have anything else on them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The polar region? That would be starting from scratch, MisterData. Our latestreadings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Glad to help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes.. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what ship is carrying the envoy? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got fifty eight minutes before we have to power down anddisengage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there anything we can do here to adapt to our current defencesystems? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: War over what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? Did the shielding work? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all right. But Cabot should stay where he is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Probably just as well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An incoming message. Code Forty Seven, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't think the Pakleds had that kind of technology. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, break orbit. Full impulse. Captain's log, Stardate 43153.7. We are departingthe Rana system for Starbase One Three Three. We leave behind a beingof extraordinary power and conscience. I am not certain if he should bepraised or condemned. Only that he should be left alone. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you and Ro. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled acrosssome sort of alien library? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what can you tell me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll just have to do the best we can without you. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. If this is a real phaser, then I was on the Enterprise. ButI fired it on myself, so I should be dead. None of this is real. I'msetting this to level sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half ofthis building. Unless, of course, this isn't a real phaser. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we're behind schedule for Parliament already. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are going to need your help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring us right into the edge of it, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was worth it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No damage in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This planet's interior heat provides anabundance of geothermal energy, sir. But it's about all this world doesoffer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know, Geordi, but I'm going to find out. Right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lanel, I really have to get going. All the other aliens arewaiting for me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got to find her, if she's still alive. Data, scan theKlingon central net. See if there's any record of her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Little change, Captain. Our shields are still inoperable. Wehave partial control of our weapons, and I've doubled the repair crews. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who's getting married? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you read that, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He had a good student. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Altered? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Manoeuvre sequence delta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alpha Onias three. The Enterprise had been probed. Geordi, Worf,and I transported down to track the source. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I might. It depends. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell is going on? Q2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've assumed they've simulated your voice somehow. I've alreadyput Data to work on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, at least that's something. What have you got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineered? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! That's an order. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just one question. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. Worf, accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maintain pursuit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Now talk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will we be able to talk to you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what the hell do the sensors say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's happening? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, Data, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't accept that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then let us meet with the men from Odin one last time. Let metry to convince them to leave with us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Talk about going nowhere fast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All decks, security alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My leg's still asleep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Under the circumstances, sir, I think you're right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is sounding better all the time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where will we get the trace pattern? The Doctor's never used ourtransporter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A letter to his wife and daughter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damnsignal. It's bouncing around more than we are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That secret hiding place of yours? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you offering to help us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Chocolate ice cream, chocolate fudge and chocolate chips. You'renot depressed, are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, bring the engines back online and restore allsystems to normal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, you know how much I respect your judgment, but Ican't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your belief. Preparethe exocomp, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by to lock phasers on target. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no way to know. Let's hope he can come part way himself. Troi, is there any way you can get a message to him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not all I want, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. You look strange, Paul. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome, I'm sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Velocity to one half metre per second. Adjust pitch angle,negative three degrees. Watch your roll angle, conn. All stations,prepare for reconnection. Thrusters to station keeping. All velocityzero. Her inertia should do the job now. Lock up now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Admiral Necheyev has just beamed aboard. She's being escortedright here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We wish to end the hostilities. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take it easy, Wes. We're going to find him. I want to begin amethodical search. Worf, set sensors on maximum scan. Data, use ourpresent location as a centre. Plot a search pattern from thesecoordinates to cover the most area in the least time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't know much about what happened either. Apparently yousaved an entire village from radiation poisoning. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have orders for me, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When we're through here, re-check the sensor logs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You weren't kidding, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever's going on. our first priority is getting back controlof the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could there have been some kind of interference from theRomulans? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, I'm not fit to resume command. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll introduce you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Just for the moment lets say that you're right. Whatdo we do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd be a fool not to realise how lucky I am to be on this shipserving with these people. It's like a dream come true. Just like this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aquiel and Morag will be transferred to asecure medical facility at Starbase twelve. Maybe we'll know more bythe time we get there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise, we're taking her in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, I'll a projection of the radiation's impact on thecrew. Mister Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we won't bejoining the search for awhile. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What am I still doing here? Deanna, I pushedmyself hard to get this far. I sacrificed a lot. I always said I wantedmy own command, and yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong for meto want to stay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've never heard of Paul Manheim. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you, Mister Data, bear a striking resemblance to Friar Tuck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like they had a rough ride. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So much for the transporter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you recommend? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. I'm sure it did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, the Counsellor and I are needed on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope it's complete. Much of my decision will be based on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's their heading, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes. See if we can slow them down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maintain position at Galorndon Core. Diplomatic initiativeappears to be succeeding. Will advise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know it's probably impossible with Taris sitting out there,but it would give everyone something to do. You go and organise it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said she was adopted. Could she be an alien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened to these pieces of metal? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Ares. She's in Vega-Omicron sector. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't believe they'd ask for your command. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the transporter logs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. I've got to study this mission briefing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My quarters are full of things that I suppose belong to both ofus. The least I could do is give you this. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going to try to pose as Korgano? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I only wish we were all as well balanced, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fifty three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were having a few problems while <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As ordered. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. Saved by the bell. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One more thing. I will conduct the mediations today, but at theend of today, regardless of the outcome, I must be removed from Riker'sbody. Even if the new host has not arrived. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You wanted to see me, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right in the middle of the gap? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Felis catus, is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermicquadruped, carnivorous by nature. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are they still alive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're right, Captain. It has to be conceivable that somewherein this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy intomatter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take aninventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that'susable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believeit's even less likely there's anyone living here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look. Try hailing them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And then he ran away? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That can't be native to the planet. The Boraalans don't haveanything close to that level of technology. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't transport him with the shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: New friends, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we just sit here, we'll lose all of our systems within anhour, including life support. Okay, I'm rerouting the propulsionsystem to the transporter. Re-channel the navigation systems. Let'stransfer every microjoule of energy we've got. Sensors, life support. This might give us one last shot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Greek, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've noticed you're intrigued with her having securityresponsibilities. But these things are not at all unusual with us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe we can accommodate your wishes. We'll rearrange thesuite assignments. If you'll follow me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly, I want you. If you're going to leave, you'd better goright now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll explain that later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to idle, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't we have a call to pay on the Romulans, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just a game. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've shut down most of the consoles tosave power. I re-routed just about everything through here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering. Is something wrong, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been able to get by for a long time without seeing him. I'm not about to start now. What made you contact him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You didn't have to kill him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The weapon systems? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Yar. Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that possible? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir, I did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's too much of a risk. I'll take that course when it's thelast one left. Who the hell are these people? There's got to be some way to get through to them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you're wrong. It's arrogant to think you'll never make amistake. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You escaped? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Widen the area. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No problem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard to the Bridge. Take us to within ten kilometresof asteroid gamma six zero one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can our mortal enemy be over a hundred years behind us inweapons technology? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you even brought provisions. Very thoughtful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why is he making it this difficult to find him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Establish position zero nine zero mark three four five at twentyseven thousand kilometres. Hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would explain the accent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I feel terrible. But thanks to you, I'm doing much better now. And I'm confident that when I leave, I will be ready to take my placein society again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A lifeform? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We picked up a request for emergencyassistance from a Federation science ship in the Topin system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, their minds are set. They don't want to hear anotheralternative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were right, Captain, we've got company. Cardassians. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean if I go back, only one of us can return? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An entire planet obliterated except for a few acres of trees andgrass and one building? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, O'Brien and Troi tried to commandeer the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're approaching the surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't there something more we can do here to seal the rupturesomehow? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At your command, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's coming. The Arcos crewmen may require immediate medicalassistance. Phasers on maximum stun. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have the miners searched them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you telling me to leave, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't have put it exactly like that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It'll take forty eight hours for a message to get to Starfleeton subspace frequency. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. I'd like to see him, immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Odd looking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only thing that's changed is you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would explain why they haven't respond to our hails. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Identical to the ones on the space vessel lifeform over there. Why was it punishing you, Groppler? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With the Ferengi around? Always. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse us, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd better get innovative. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are we going to go, Ethan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up, photontorpedoes activated, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Mister Data. Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know Jeremy well? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no degeneration. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You want us to search through all this to find him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You may fire the probe when ready, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, why don't you give me the overview of your researchwhile Mister La Forge and your assistant take a look at theexperimental data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what's that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be there. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. That structure is surrounded by breathableair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You what? What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No cards? The best poker face I've ever seen. Dealer takes two. Your three and ten more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Please bring my people here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not possible. He's too far away for a positive lock. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, send a subspace message to Starfleet command. Securitychannel authorisation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On whose authority? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So far as he knew, sir, you could have been dead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reports coming in now. Nothing serious so far. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I doubt if they'll agree to that. But maybe if we tell themGeordi's dying, they would give us access to a medical kit. We might beable to use some of the tools to make a weapon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See if you can help shut down the plasma flow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd hate to have to scrap her. Starfleet could certainly useanother ship, even if she is old. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's nothing urgent. I'm sorry I bothered you. Good night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. Get ready to deploy the mines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Travel time to the nearest starbase? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then why are they so desperate for the felicium? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An old Chinese philosopher from ancient Earth history. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it scanning us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, let's spread out. Twenty five metre radius. Ourwindow back closes in twelve minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If he stays at that speed, he'll self-destruct. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Primary control's shorted out.  WORF <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A class eight probe is just over two metres long. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You still wish you'd killed me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. Fire when ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another entity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'd better get going. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would three Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken downfreighter? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got to figure out how we've handledthis before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First officer to Captain. Ready withthe away personnel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't need explanations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The arrangements have already been made. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are we still picking up the Entity's pattern? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They made you the lure to keep me here. They programmed youwhile I was relaxing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, Doctor, they'll be at theirdestination in less than a minute. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, put the turbolifts back online. If Danar sees they'reoperating, he may try to use them. Soon as he does, we have him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Two Til'amin froths, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh? I would have thought otherwise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? Tomalak is a Romulan Captain. The only timehe was ever called Ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy. How do youknow about that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you stay and talk? I wanted to remember our last nighttogether. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't consider even one survivor petty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported aboutthose weapons? They're razor sharp, split-second lethal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In that dream they gave me drugs. Didn't anybody at the theatresee anything strange happen during the performance? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like intoxication, but worse. Judgment almost completelyimpaired, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you were willing to settle for second. Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Survivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She must be tapping into some sort of power source to producethese effects. She's not hiding that up her sleeve. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you callenhancement, you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockoutlike you doing in a computer-generated joint like this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, we're still here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have saved your life twice already, Galen. I would think you'dbegin to show some gratitude by now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They won't back off. They've been willing to fight to the deathin past encounters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's twenty three parsecs beyond our furthest mannedexplorations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know where they went? So you know whothey are and you know where I can find them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's it? What's the emergency? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hypothetically speaking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll leave that to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge, engage engines! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I can understand why you're feeling uneasy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where the hell is he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Start firing countdown from twenty four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. Any sign of thescience team? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So the Hera's in one piece somewhere out there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice job, Geordi.>RIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, Troi and I will return to the Enterprise. When you'vereached a conclusion, you can contact us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it were unable to reach warp speed, it would have taken allthese years to get here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, one of your people can do the work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that all? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keller, can you get to a Jeffries tube? Ensign Keller, answerme! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You hope you never do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's time, sir. We should go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to saythat there's no real difference between them. Physically, men arebigger, stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs. Men can't bear young. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable incrowded rooms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Difficult decision. Yes, I can do that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You brought us here, you exposed us to them, and you cost us thelives of our shipmates Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it's time we to leave this place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've just got to tie in Geordi's atmospheric sensors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've received word from Ambassador Mauric. He's ready to see you and Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does wrestling with a Klingon targ ring a bell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You used them as slave labourers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds like it might be an SOS. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Impossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead andjust leave it at that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Full scan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, if you've got a theory about what's happening? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your scan was inconclusive. We don't know what happened to theYamato. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Since then, the Federation has colonised several planets in thatsector. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand that you think it's necessary. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And now you want to try it again? How many people will die thistime? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know where I can find them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. Congratulations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am First Officer William Riker of the Enterprise. We'reresponding to your distress signal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, at our current speed, how long will it take us toget through the asteroid belt? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great job, boys. But, computer, blondes and jazz seldom gotogether. Now that is truly exceptional. But more sultry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Taris, prepare to receive a transmission from ourChief Engineer. He'll instruct you how to purge your system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are our channels secure on your end? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can we be sure these records haven't been falsified? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't take that much expertise to repair a servo link. Youand I can handle it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, yourtouch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and thinkseem so real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, we're giving you an assignment. One thing we don'twant to hear is that it is impossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You bet. Dying is bad enough but, to lose my sense of humour? Forget it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We recognise your situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then he must be hurt or dead. When does our next window open up,Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excalibur, Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what scared her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Resume course and speed. Scanners at maximumrange. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running hisdiagnostic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any mention of a situation like this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They might have been able to repair their engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What part of me does he represent? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, let's say we initiate a full power warp pulse. Howmuch time do we need to drop out of warp? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You think? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's how it seemed to all of us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me wasrecognising and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed aniron hand. I imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with acrew that is so different. I would be happy to guide you in thatregard, if it would be helpful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my mark, point seven five burst. We just want to get theirattention. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. I remember that now. But I thought it was a Klingon who hadcut me with a knife. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to search the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand you've been talking to every shuttlepilot on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a Federation shuttlecraft, all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will it take to set up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've been observing the planet very carefully for three hours. We've seen nothing. I have the feeling you're waiting for something tohappen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's our poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat foryou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's some kind of probe. I'll bet that's what damaged thearray. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought I had. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No sign of intelligence, no brain as we know it, yet evidence ofthought, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I could lose it in a minute. I've just gotten used to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think he's a plant to draw us into the Neutral Zone. Thenwe'll look like the aggressors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any other ships in that sector? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain and I, along with seven others managed to get to theescape pod before the breach became critical. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes becausethey thought we were using it to spy on them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you tried the intercom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Residual thermal traces. Somebody stood here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've received an emergency transmissionfrom the science station on Ventax Two, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, we're way ahead of schedule. Alter course for AlphaOmicron. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. We need to knock out the scatteringfield in one shot and have the Captain back on the Enterprise beforethey know what happened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We would like two torches. Head high? And what else? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we lose antimatter containment <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Old friends. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Klingons are very thorough. I'm sure Commander Kurn hasstudied for his assignment just as I did when I served with them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it's changed intensity, it can't possibly be a protostar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have means of pursuit? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then she is alive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, we don't have to like each other to work welltogether. As a fact of fact, I'd like you to continue to keep me on mytoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for anexperience that's primitive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're pushing away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when we drop our shields, the Calamarains go after Q again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Riker's plan is more dangerous, but it does have abetter chance of succeeding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, contact all ships in this sector to rendezvousand join us in relief efforts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Flattered, sort of. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Frankly, Lieutenant, I don't think that's realistic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Except for now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, we've already run into one dead end. Indri Eight doesn't seem much more promising. And we're late for theconference on Atalia Seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security, allow them access into cargo bay four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll check in with you later. 1 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was found in our Captain's chest, which brought over from theStargazer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And these? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, what happened down there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As First Officer, it is my responsibility to point out anyactions that may be mistakes by a commanding officer. sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're damn right! And I intend to stay angry until I findwhoever's responsible for the Captain's death. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, forward phaser array. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. Idon't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did they send the right shuttle? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire up the engines. Half impulse until we clear the nebula,then punch it to warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't know that we have twenty hours. That star could explodeat any moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What Federation starship was closest toKhitomer at the time of the attack? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about Geordi and Worf? Were theyinfected too? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I tried talking to you yesterday on the station. You wouldn'thear me out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You disagree with me, fine. You need to take it to the Captain,then fine. Through me. You do an end run around me again, I'll snap youback so hard, you'll think you're a first year cadet again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You must understand, whoever I seem to be, I am Odan, who lovedyou. That has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that. If thiscauses you pain, I will suppress it, I will keep my distance. DoctorBeverly, I would never hurt you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get offthis ship. Are there any others survivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously nothing we have now can stop them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've lost contact with our ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It didn't spare everyone, Doctor. If you'll check your reports,you'll find that two of the colonists didn't survive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck if you have to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security guard to the Engineering deck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To your success, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vulcan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering to bridge, did you copy that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a hole in space,with no crew aboard. Now what is the purpose? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I love surprise parties. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, not at all. Have a seat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, that's enough! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase to ten to the third power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell do they want with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going with them? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've arranged your usual accommodation, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No reason. I've worked out the new rotation schedules. I'd likeyou to cross-check the personnel assignments. Notify the departmentheads. Your Bridge shift begins at twenty three hundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you report this? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is he alive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's the children. That's why we've been brought here. That'swhat they wanted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. It's for my meeting with Beata. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With your permission, we'd like to begin our search immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First load ready, Mister O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Minister. Now, if you'll excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, Okona is an interesting man, certainly. We've seen how hehandles his ship. Apparently he knows how to handle people as well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very good, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've heard better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It almost did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security to the Bridge! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It might prove to be beneficial. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, if you didn't contract for this, who did? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, report to Transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a good chance we will be able to retrieve the databasefrom one of the consoles inside the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How is it moving, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I still have a phaser. Why do I still have a phaser? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars,and the universe worships the night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your memories are gone as well? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To make sure he wasn't tampered with? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiatehimself to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Weapons status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your Honour, I offer in evidence prosecution's exhibit A, a rodof par-steel. Tensile strength, forty kilobars. Commander, would youbend that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We haven't got the power. Captain's log, supplemental. The life form, whichhas significantly increased in size, is again attempting to communicatewith us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is more important than Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My favourite part of dinner. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just the same, let's keep the shields up for the time being. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Finish dealing the hand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She was part of a very special programme. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign ofany Borg, or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long before this hull ruptures? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently some of them were apparentlyblown out the emergency hatches. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hooked it. My father took the rod away. He wouldn't let mereel it in. He was afraid that I might lose it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Velocity, warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I take it he found something wrong in Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How far? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And how could I forget that you didn't have enough latinum tocover my winnings? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No unnecessary risks. Clear? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. It's your daughter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam Salia to the specifiedcoordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you able to pinpoint the source of their particle beam? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have complete confidence in Mister Data's ability to check upon himself. Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, you bringhim in here and ask him face to face. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the Cardassians? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I said main Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't be modest. You can't tell me you haven't come up with afew culinary delights. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will that take? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you certain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what if we re-connect their command pathways and we givethem a choice? You've assumed the exocomps would shut down beforeaccepting this mission. What if we ask them if they are willing toproceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. What's happening, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give me that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is? Then the Drake has not been destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Dix, but our two passengers have awakened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ship and crew functioning normally, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was a smash. We got a standing ovation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm on my way. You'llhave to handle this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi's found something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Minuet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you want to be with him, you don't have to ask my permission. It's the look in your eyes. I recognise it. You used to have it for me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've broken orbit and laid in acourse for Daled Four. We will remain on impulse power until LieutenantLa Forge completes his adjustments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean you're using this ship to transport a sentient being asproperty? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's only fair to mention Wesley in a logentry, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, what are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And remembering. You should have been the one to die, not her. Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise is going to try to interceptthe Sheliak colony ship. Your job well, you know what your job is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Other than the tetryon emissions in cargobay four, our internal sensors haven't recorded anything unusual in thepast three days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the dayafter tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A face off. The question is, who's going to move first? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The cargo bays. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, the Romulans want a confrontation specificallywith us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You think our visitors pose a threat? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, at their current speed, when will they reachEarth? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, putting you down there only strengthens their position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire all weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stop, Mister Worf! That is an order! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll do my pre-flight once I'm on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you repair them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi? The moon's trajectory? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bravo! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've arranged for a shuttle to take you to Starbase twentythree. You can leave the ship at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When is today's transport? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The man they knew as my father, the man who stands before them,both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you believe that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher tells me that in order to inflict the kind ofmolecular damage found in Rocha's remains, it would take a sustainedphaser discharge of at least thirty to forty seconds. That doesn'tsound like self-defence to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The colony laboratory. Extremely well equipped. Does this stirany memories, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trappedhere. We're in no immediate dangerRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How was the second pattern able to maintained its integrity? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well, I'll inform the Captain. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's been no direct contact with the Romulans since the TomedIncident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And risk a war? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Might we have moved into another dimension? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess you're surprised to see me, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The transmission <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I promise you, Captain, they will never know that I am ill. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How far have these negotiations progressed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, would you explain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Now, the first thing I think we need to discuss isthis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a chance that our doctors can do something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've got to narrow that down. What's happening with theenhanced sensor arrays? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actualorder to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,but it works. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you have any luck downloading the station logs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want to be able to pull him out ofthere in case we have to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One sure way into the record books, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Main Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't understand. I can't give the eulogy because I won't beat the service. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. We can't put him through any further risk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rendezvous with the saucer section. Lay in a course of pursuit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up, maximum strength. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I won't be pushed into this decision. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't sound very optimistic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's almost time. I want the boy broughthere now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Double 'em up. Here we go. TEXAS <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, sir, Altair Three was too dangerous to riskexposing the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Moriarty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could she be another refugee from the Qcontinuum? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For once he and I agree on something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I reconfigured that computer so many times they probably can'tmake heads or tails of it. I'd be happy to help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have no choice. Energise. I thought you said there were six. Where are the other two? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have nothing we can compare it with. It's microscopic. Itseems colonial, simple. But it's inorganic. Which is why the reconscouts missed it. It was not your mistake. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard. If you'll follow me I will show you theaccommodations that we've <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What if you're wrong? Sorry. But what if it is more than a merediscrepancy? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's just trying to eliminate the possibility that one of youmight be carrying an organism that was harmful to Deanna. I'm not implying that you did anything intentional. I'm just trying toget to the bottom of the mystery. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Begin power transfer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, I think that third wave should be in position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll take you to Sickbay, after that <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Louder. Faster. More of them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's get moving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything we know about them is based on rumour or conjecture. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've always wanted to see terraforming in operation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if I don't? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We think your system contains one of these null pockets. Ifwe're right, the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy fromanything that entered it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All hands, battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I have a schematic of the explosion site. It suggeststhe cause as a methane-like gas seeping in from underground. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, this is a battle simulation. You're my Tactical Officer. I've discussed this with Geordi and we agreed. You need to be at myside. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did you know, sir? I feel like such an idiot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shield status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why were you in stasis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's wonderful, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A few more seconds I could've saved his lifeWORF <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Womencarry the baby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, did the sensors pick up anything unusual last night? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're here, there's no danger. We'll look around then leave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reset dampeners. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we're being probed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am Will Riker. I don't know who or what made it back to thePotemkin that day, but it wasn't me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How much longer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How the hell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any insights? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior tous? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many guards in the shuttlebay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, is this possibly related to the energy fields on theplanet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good thing we didn't bring Data. We'd be unscrambling hiscircuits for a week. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell me what this is all about. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronicnet would ionise in no time. I can't let you sacrifice yourself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine. The Duras sisters,Lursa and B'Etor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How much has been changed? What exactly did you do? ONE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need more speed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Selays are playing hide and seek down here,obviously with the Anticans. It's a lethal game. I want them returnedto their quarters under guard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you let us know about it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've arrived at Ramatis Three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. But I guess I got over it. You're here. Resume. It'simportant to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you be more specific? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Generated by what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Stargazer, please respond. Enterprise to Captain Picard aboard Stargazer. Please answer. MisterData, what was Stargazer's condition? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Borg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about energy readings? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forty seven, including the captain of the Adelphi and twofriends from my class at the Academy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But the probability of making a six is no greater than that ofrolling a seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangleLORE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. No weapons. We don't want them to think they're underattack. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wantsanswered. He suggested that I take you with me on the away team I'll beleading. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And for the Ornarans. Without the medicine, they would all die. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And that gave you the right to assault us, to rob us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any records of similar phenomena in Starfleet listings? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him. I don'tunderstand why he wanted <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have no such intention, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe none of it was real. Perhaps we were all part of a sharedillusion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status on the repair? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, they're expecting us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we contactthem and let them know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's too dangerous. Our scans show the caverns are unstable. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, thanks. I don't like fudge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That should do it. All members of the Enterprise crew areaccounted for, Mister Conor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's going to have a great time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then prove it. You can begin by telling me something about thelocation and strength of the Romulan fleet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Both. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've also got some volcanic activity. Pretty severe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana? Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I really have to leave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I want to talk about this now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will not surrender the secrets of the Enterprise to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Use your brain. They wouldn't be searching the shuttle if theyhad the artefact. Koral must have it. Where is that Klingon pilot? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds like our Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander? That's quite formal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's beamed himself aboard the Stargazer, and I'm wondering ifthis has something to do with it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. I don't know what youdid, sir, but it looks like everything's back to normal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Viewer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Advise the warbird to withdraw from Federation space, and tellthem to leave the Vulcan ships where they are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering!. Engineering, come in! Geordi, are you okay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess we really are different. I never really cared for thatname. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My pleasure, Doctor. Wes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mistress Beata, if you had an alternative to the execution ofRamsey and his followers, would you take it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is off the record. I'm saying this as a friend, not yoursuperior officer. I think it would be best if you weren't so personallyinvolved with Aquiel right now. There's a lot about her we don't know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Working theories are fine, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's happening again. I think you'd better get inhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Amanda. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have I mentioned how imaginative the Risian women are, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Navigators on this ship have been doingflight handling assessments the same way for years, Ensign. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe we left our tickets in our compartments. Mister Worf,I told you to bring the tickets. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What sort of signal? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I made it a couple of years ago down on the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or it may be out there waiting for us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is Captain Picard all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've guided his training, sir, I'm the one at fault. You willshow the proper respect. I will accompany you down there to makecertain of it. With your approval, of course, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't believe anything's overtaking us this fast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not what happened. I was the last one out and I made itback to the Potemkin. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not going anywhere. You'll be one of us soon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just positive ones, sir. Actually, I just welcomed Ensign Mendonon board. He certainly seems eager to please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A complete sensor scan of the planet andthree survey probes turned up no surprises. No signs of life, nothingout of the ordinary. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase to half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it's not naturally occurring? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beam them out of there, Mister O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incoming transmission from the Romulancommand ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure it's still in the memory banks,but I used to have a great fishingprogramme on the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, troubles. We've got some, Captain. It seems that a certainwoman, both wealthy and beautiful, now thinks that that she's going tomarry me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their defences apparently prevent deep strikes into each other'sterritory. Minor skirmishes are all that's left. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't stabilise the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like a song reminds you of an old friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They agreed to trade places for a week, to understand eachother's situation with more informed eyes. After that an agreement cameswiftly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you propose we do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Er. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Because you're the property of the Sovereign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wasn't ready to leave here anyway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's nothing unusual about this house, except the fact thatit's here. What about them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The mission with the Legarans cannot be carried out with Sarekin this condition! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Murder? Now wait a minute, you can't come on <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Was I that obvious? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a fusion reactor in the house, good for another fiveyears of power. But theirwater table is tainted. They have nothing to feed themselves except fora small garden. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They claim to be our escort. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Assemble an away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we have a confrontation, I don't want a crew fighting theBorg at the same time they're fighting their own fatigue. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not very friendly, are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything status quo, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Romulan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academycredit for your work here. I don't think you have anything to worryabout. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, sir, I find it hard to believe you're that good a singer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Commander, what is the capacity of your memory, andhow fast can you access information? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. How's the arm? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I may, Captain. Then a trade, Groppler? Some things you needin return for lending us architects and engineerswho can demonstrate your techniques. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So unless someone runs to a window and looks out <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With your permission, I'd like to look inside of the house. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, status report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf? Anybody?! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data. You're my First Officer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't sound very confident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The T9 energy converter has been beamed aboard and secured, sir. The Ferengi complained bitterly, but one final roar from Portalconvinced them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We think so. The shuttle probably wasn't able to sustain itsenergy, but other than that it wouldn't be damaged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It'll take a few days before you know whereeverything is. If you need any help, you just use one of these comm. panels. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know the feeling. The past few nights, it seems like as soonas my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up in the morning. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concernis with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisonerto that of Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would prefer it if Lieutenant Worf and I were able to asecurity sweep of the ship first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Release control of this ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take it. How'd you know I was bluffing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I remember my early lessons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile. Who knows, we could all end up that way some day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate thosestorms. Do you have any ideas, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the first thing you remember, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No voice interface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These enemies are Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors picking up any signs of life? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd appreciate it if Commander La Forge and I could stay hereuntil the Enterprise returns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Since the pod is so small, it will be difficult to detect. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life veryappealing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As First Officer of the Enterprise I think I can promise youthat's not going to happen. The Kes will be denied membership. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you revive him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Frozen. How many? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I volunteer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe we've covered every available alternatives, Captain. Are there other options that you want to analyse? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensornetwork and make sure that we haven't overlooked anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Keller, answer me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought if one thing were clear by now, it's that you and Iplay things a little differently. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think that Devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's find out, or try to. Contact the Ferengi vessel,Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ninety eight? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why, what is this attitude? On Kabatris I had to wear furs tomeet the leadership council. And on Armus Nine I wore feathers. Thisobjection doesn't have anything to do with the fact that Beata is awoman, and an attractive one, does it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, of course. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then they would learn nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He was into some bad business. He took the evidence with him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Complete your scans, Data. Let's not stay any longer than wehave to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status of torpedo banks? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's probably a good idea. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think that's the case here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then pick the body and let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers. If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone cansurvive on this moon for long. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even Danar can't move that fast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell is he up to? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I told him I'd feed him while he was gone. I was just puttingdown the bowl of food. The next thing I know there's a hissing ball offur coming at my face. I hate cats. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Devour vessels? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Admiral, with all due respect, it's not necessary to giveCaptain Jellico command of the Enterprise just to conduct anegotiation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What can you do for him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You waiting for something? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're heading for the Cordannas system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why hasn't anybody discovered this before? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do. When you say Commander you say it like you say Sovereignto Marouk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep me advised. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's try that again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unbelievable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain says Shelby reminds him of the way I used to be. Andhe's right. She comes in here full of drive and ambition. Impatient,taking risks. I look at her and I wonder whatever happened to thosethings in me? I liked those things about me. I've lost something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've never encountered a natural force that powerful. Why onlysix hours? Why not a day? Or a year? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what is the second option? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering to Bridge, we're ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our friend is back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wonder if one doesn't have to have age and wisdom toappreciate that, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had no effect on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, override security lock on thisdoor. Authorisation, Riker alpha six zero. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, whydon't you give me a call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bynars. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any recommendations? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. Captain, we're ready to beam it back to theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. Is this a dream? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did he die? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reduce life support to minimum requirements,Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If they did hijack the Fleming, they sure didn't get very farwith the cargo. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The sooner the better. Enterprise, we have an injury. TransportSoren directly to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on target bearing to port. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. Secure channel, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What makes you say that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unidentified craft in the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hang on! Come on, grab on. Come on! Come on, climb! Come on! I'm being pulled in. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that. I can'tstop thinking about you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir, they are not! I will obey your orders. I will servethis ship as First Officer, and in an attack against the Enterprise Iwill die along with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyaltyto Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I see you've done some redecorating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, try it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dan, it's me. It's Will Riker. I was here yesterday, remember? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, there is. Give it to me. They've taken me for the last fewnights. If I'm right, the same thing'll happen tonight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fajo spent more than half a day in orbit. Departed just overseven hours ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Because nobody's ever done it before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Name it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors have discovered a small one-man spaceship crashed on theplanet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've cloaked themselves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to back to the ship. Let me know as soon as you havesomething. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And why not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker, WT, reporting as ordered, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What will happen to him then? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To link artificial intelligencedirectly into the humanoid brain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to explore the rest of the hotel. We'll keep a comm. line open. You two go down to the lobby and see if there's anythingthat we've missed. You talk to the guests and try to find out who orwhat they are. I'll check out the rest of the floors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we disengage the pulse? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Turbolifts two, three, four, everyone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure as hell not going to beam up whatever might be downthere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fifteen minutes after that, another. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and prepare to beam us directly toSickbay, but hang on for my signal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of theseeruptions is awesome. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At one point they were at Deep Space Nine, trying to sellbilitrium explosives. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise'll be there, sir. Maybe a little late, but we'llbe there, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be inholodeck four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on the mission itinerary <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hide? Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. The beard is an ancient andproud tradition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. Have a seat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jazz. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing of the sort. As the governing body of Angel One, you'reentitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get him to a detention cell. Set phasers on maximum stun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When not to duck would be more accurate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bridge will be fine, since I've called the entire staff. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter Room, this is Commander Riker. Beam up four at myco-ordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, a glass of water, five degrees. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. And Captain, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps Geordi should give them something they want. Somethingimportant. Then we simply create the right moment for him to take itaway, and get him the hell out of there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. What is this allabout? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What is theirpurpose? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That can be arranged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sure, Kolrami is the best ever at Strategema. Just to get toplay him is a privilege. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: True, but I've had fifteen years to practise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage mooring beams and lock off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cover the ship as planned. Move out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, we need to get your rendezvous schedule to CommanderRudman on board the Merrimac as soon as you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The archive just activated some kind of tractor beam, sir. We'renot able to disengage it. ]PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know, sir. It sounds like your voice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's all just sit down and try to talk about what's happened toCaptain Picard and Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now I know you're bluffing. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe there's someone waiting for us in the ObservationLounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These are your quarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No idea. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds like a plan. Lets get started. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aren't we all. But you sent out a Mayday? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great. Set course. Velocity warp two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're justtrapped in their own anger. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coming apart, Chief. We've got to do it now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope that'll give the Captain enough time to play his hand. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For all we know, the Ambassador might enjoy an evening'sentertainment <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Notify the transporter room I have fourteen to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if the Ferengi also realise the forcefield emanates from theplanet, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf! What happened? Where's the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were right. Somebody blew the hatch. They were all suckedout into space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You get Morag. I'm going to the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's impossible. Soong's dead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? I am Commander William T Riker. What is going on here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When do we leave? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They are, sir. Which is why they have made the First Officerdirectly responsible for an engine's conditionand performance. Guided, of course, by one of our Chief Engineers,Lieutenant Commander Argyle in this case. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are still risks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket. He thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we work on the assumption they've all been destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to do this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where am I? How did you get me off the ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you like. It won't change anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, you used a colloquialism. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's complete, but I would like to request an addition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't wait three weeks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think you did the right thing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Main Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Granted. Tell Mister O'Brien to take all the primarytransporters offline. I don't want to risk any further contaminations. Make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will someone answer that damn ringing! Captain, the ringing isgetting worse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's already killed thousands. It will undoubtedly continue tokill unless we stop it. I don't want those deaths on my conscience. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Optimal firing range in fifty five seconds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He speaks forty languages? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How are the surface winds, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Shuttle One. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's worth a try. Captain T'Jon go to your transporter room. Contact me from there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, how much more can we get out of that tractorbeam? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom. Perhapshe could assist us in lifting his brother's spirits. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the explanation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the one they've chosen is you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Swell. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The last report we have says they were observing the streamer atmedium range. Maybe they went in for a closer look, got more than theybargained for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In any case, a trading situation developed which still exists. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many people would it take to set that up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Five, and twenty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So much for your reprieve from Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great. Strange. For a long time I did whatever I wanted,whenever I wanted. It's been hard taking orders again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look at this, we've all got three of a kind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, I brought something back from Risa that you have got totry it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Doctor Crusher, join me in Transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When was it detected? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll get us out of here, Ethan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker. What are your intentions, CaptainEndar? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not surprised. How did you respond? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did I miss something? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you got a minute? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you made your nine year old brother believe that he'd killedyou? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. Wewon't cause you any more trouble. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell you what. I'll bet that I can find any card that you hidein this deck. And furthermore, I will make you help me find it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suppose you mean that as a compliment, Q. Or maybe it's mylimited mind. But to become a part of you? I don't even like you. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you can pull that off, Mister Worf, it might just give us theedge we're looking for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Riker on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. But you can't make someone love you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we weren't scanned by that probe. How did this thing getaboard the Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about a computer core from thirty or forty years ago? Onethe Romulans are already familiar with. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise from away team, come in. Are you receiving us,Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will it be good enough? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I said, shut up. As in close your mouth and stop talking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened, Tasha? <eos>

 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the Odinsurvivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set a course to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not if I weaken first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The method of attrition must take a little getting used to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll get right on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I have a minute? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you get any playback at all? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recognise it, sir. It's the crystal image Lore described. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Activating power systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields at maximum. Full reverse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But he wouldn't listen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your honour, we'll stipulate to all of this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Trouble. Captain's log, supplemental. While on a mission torescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team hasencountered a strange creature which seems able to assume differentforms, including one which resembles humanoid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what's on your mind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does this ionisation pose a threat to Mister Barclay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did you say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're having difficulties withour communications. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like yesterday. The Janaran Falls on Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How will you proceed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is not a battle, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, I need help in locating some librarycomputer information. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What kind of rumour? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're investigating the disappearance of a Vulcan ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes,one of the hostages will be executed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, Wesley. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vibration? We're not talking about a violin, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's leaking ion radiation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all part of being in Starfleet. There. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A grandfather? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign DeSeve, by order of Starfleet Command I am placing youunder arrest for treason. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All found in an open locker? I don't think he was too concernedwith security. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We don't know what's going on downthere. There's no need to take any chances. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Meaning somebody engineered it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi's ill. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Interesting hypothesis. Are there any M-class planets we couldcheck out? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm trying. You need a bigger head. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To their cloning lab. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recommend that I return to the cruiser with an away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what thisstuff is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then why haven't I heard from you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enough to power a small phaser bank, a subspace relay station,or <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What he means is, what planet is this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, that'll change your point of view. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you be more specific, Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From the look of it the Borg are born as biological life form. It seems that almost immediately after birth they begin artificialimplants. Apparently the Borg have developed the technology <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's got to be a better way to deal with it than this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we access it from here? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I ask what the Captain decided? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Close the channel, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They haven't. I've already spoken to the Hekaran government. According to them, only one ship has passed through the system in thelast week. It was a Ferengi trader. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing I've been invited to. Any of you? Very interesting! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually, Guinan, I <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold your position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where do we find them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What a sight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But this is not the time for change. I need you all where youare, where Captain Picard always relied on you. I have been,reluctantly, forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert onthe Borg, is an ideal choice at this time for first officer. Based onour latest communication, we can assume that the Borg survived thefleet's attack. Your thoughts on our next encounter? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, this is critical. How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Parthas? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Chief, do you have them? They're not here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled bythree primary main processing cores, cross-linked with a redundantmelacortz ramistat. fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The coreelement is based on an nanoprocessor with twenty five bilateralkelilactirals, with twenty of those being slaved into the primaryheisenfram terminal. Now you do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here's your ten, and it will cost you another one hundred. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was on the Enterprise in the middle of a play. But it washere. It was not real, it was on a stage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow usout of the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's try it. Mister Crusher, realign for polar orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's an order, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back intowarp, our weapon is useless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But our sensors were malfunctioning. Our probe clearlyestablished the planet could not support life. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what is going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It appears you've inherited someone else's problem. An old wastevessel caught by your planet's gravitational pull. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I want to talk about this now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The signal ended abruptly at oh four five five. Unable to raisethem on subspace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Out of the goodness of your heart. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to draw their fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course, Jean-Luc. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, is there any record anywhere of any occurrence evenvaguely similar to this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring us to within ten thousandkilometres and hold us there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twelve hundred hours. Alpha shift isrelieved. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Carving us up like a roast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I refuse to believe you ever said that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a possibility. It would have to be perfectly timed, andthere's no guarantee. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Data, it was. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Metal fragments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why this module and not the others? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There they are, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Paranoia, I'd say. But of what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your captain is under attack. Drop your particle field. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Please let me touch you, just for a moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The way Mendrossen described him, I expectedto see a frail old man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello, ladies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've an open wound, right here. It hurts like hell. I don't wantit to get better, and I don't want to pretend that everything's allright. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: End simulation. Something told me you wouldn't let this go. Congratulations. You passed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. I'll see you later) <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you have to admit that these could kill. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Problem, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you'd find the tools we use rather unusual, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up in herefor days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,what to think, what to say. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One of your strengths is your ability to evaluate the dynamicsof a situation, and then take a definitive pre-emptive step, takecharge. Now, you're frustrated because you not only can't see thesolution, you can't even define the problem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Be ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand any of this. Who are these people? What areyou doing involved with them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even at warp nine we wouldn't get there for another twentyminutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their sensors should have picked us up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello. I'm here to see Soren. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we know who's on board? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We all are, Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was she like? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're in position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Professor Galen contacted me from his shuttle an hour ago. Hesuggested that we surprise you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously they need our help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wish I could tell you about him. We think he may be heldinside the compound. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think this is one instance where you should suppressyour natural tendencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We may need your presence here, Captain. We have serioustrouble with a member of our away team and an unusual law they havehere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe you haven't heard. I tried to kill him yesterday. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. His security scans came up negative. They're stillchecking the sensor logs but there is no indication that you ever leftthe ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What changed your mind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a vacation planet, eh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try it now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf's what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can humans survive down there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't know that. Neither of us knows what happened after weleft. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, please report to the Observation lounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know that too. 'For exceptional valour during the evacuationof the research station on Nervala Four'. I looked at his servicerecord. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't even see it coming. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us to half impulse, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not part of the plan. Pipe it through. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have to find a way to penetrate the forcefield around TenForward. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. Captain's log, stardate 42827.3. Commander Rikerhas reached the caverns, where he is making preparations to begin theevacuation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did we get him back? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make it so. With dispatch, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. Just a little numb, that's all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Blood? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you like to go again? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We must have come full circle, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That will take us very close to the Neutral Zone, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I shunted the database to the main core underneath thestation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Should we tell her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've accessed the command pathways. The interlink pathways arefunctioning now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think I should have assigned a security team to keep aneye on our guests? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready all weapons, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've tied into your computers, if you'd like to access thefiles. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Because of a man you once knew named Penthar-Mul. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us out of here. Full impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, Counsellor, but you must. We needmore information. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I remember a certain junior officer meeting a very seriouspsychologist. The best part about being assigned to Betazed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, sit down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One down, Captain <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've located another survivor of theKhitomer massacre, Captain a woman who was found with Worf. Her name isKahlest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, but I want you in and out of there as quickly aspossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We received a distress call from the New Berlin Colony. They'reunder attack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you two seal the chamber. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As First Officer, I have complete security clearance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But you said their sensors didn't work in this tunnel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You want something from us, desperately. What is it? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it needs a little more help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An epidermal mold. Made to give your exterior the desired finish. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I strongly recommend redeploying allavailable defences to protect sector zero zero one, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And not even a thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander William T. Riker, Federation starshipEnterprise. I know this may seem an unusual way <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The south-west quarter covers over two hundred squarekilometres. That's a lot of land for one man to cover. I guess I'dbetter pack an extra pair of boots. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I honestly don't know, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's down on that planet waiting for us to come back. It killedTasha and it could have killed us, but it didn't. Deanna and Ben arealive for a reason, and it knows we're not going anywhere as long asthey're still alive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forgive me, friend, but the stranger must be set free. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior tous? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see if we can tap directly into the computer core. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should ask his cat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've got to be around here somewhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This doesn't make any sense. Locking the unit in a diagnosticmode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer. Why wouldanyone want to <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, I'm puzzled about your reversing our course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So long, Ro. Take care of yourself. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you taking all these books? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think there's enough food here, Data? Good evening. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold fast. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will remove the burden of that responsibility right now. Myrelationship with Deanna stands very well on its own without any helpfrom you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, this novel and everything Data just described <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They tried to decommission her about five years ago. One of theadvantages of being an Admiral is you get to choose your own ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's my duty as First Officer to safeguard the lives onthis ship, including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you,sir. Certainly not in this situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jev, I'm not accusing you of anything. Did she mention feelingill? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is different than I remember. The place was a mess when weleft. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She says he's too ill to make the trip. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The sensors? They've been scanning that comet for the pasteighteen hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another E-band blip? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know who did this to you, or why, but it can change. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the lateral sensors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: M-class. Nickel-iron core, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Changed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Attention, crew of the Hathaway. This is your Captain. Overthe next two days, you might lose a lot of sleep, but with your skilland your stamina, we'll have this old lady ready to fly. I want hourlyprogress reports from all stations. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is second-hand merchandise. You wouldn't want him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None that we've encountered. In theory, accelerating beyond warpten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. Whenyou've settled in, we can complete our briefing. Have Security arrange an escort for this gentleman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Soren. I love you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data also saw a straw in my head and then Beverly discovered anorganism in the same place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I may suggest, sir, that first leap out of our galaxy was, ashe said, a mistake. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You never told me you knew him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage control teams, deck fourteen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? What's the matter? Why can't he leave? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Service record, Riker, William T. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, my friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energy consumption? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said you were trying to get to the weapons locker. Is therea possibilitythat you did? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. But win, all right? The pride of the Enterprise goes withyou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A friendly one, I hope? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you waiting for? Answer it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set a standard orbit. Any evidence of a mining expedition? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did she say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think that's what happened twelve yearsago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus after we leftthe ship. The plasma ignited in space, and it looked as if the ship hadbeen destroyed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not a question of harm. One William Riker is unique,perhaps even special. But a hundred of him, a thousand of himdiminishes me in ways I can't even imagine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That was too easy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's just designed to be an exercise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Alliance? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: His career. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pretty single-minded bug. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors. If youand Geordi are through down there, we'd like to have you on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer. JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who gave that command? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, Deanna, just what the hell is allthis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a little too selective to be coincidence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a long story, Mister Worf. I'll brief you later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The procedure didn't work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I awakened to find myself here in theRoyale Hotel, precisely as described in the novel I found in my room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you be interested in selling me the ore you're carrying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is going to take a little time to explain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you want to make sure that doesn't happen again, you'd betterre-initiate your regulator sub-compressors. A full diagnostic of yourintermix chamber wouldn't hurt either. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set to kill. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course not. He must have seen me use the comm. panel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your orders, sir. How would you like me to get over there,sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which would suggest they also have the ability to communicatewith us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think anyone would object to our arriving ahead ofschedule? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure we won't. Energise.  SCHOLAR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good luck, Will. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Glad you're here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, is it the same ship we faced at J two five? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here. Let me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, of course not. This is the isopalavial interface whichcontrols the main firomactal drive unit. Don't touch that. You'll blowup the entire firomactal drive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell them to stand by. If this works, we'll be on our way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible, Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could probably scare up seven, maybe eight, more ships. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I were, I'm sure you'll be the first to know. Poker's atseventeen hundred hours in my quarters. Deck eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She gets a full head of steam, doesn't she. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pick a card. Don't let me see it. Now lose itin the deck. Cut the deck into two even piles. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's too far down there. There's nothing to hold on to. No wayto climb down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your honour, there is only one issue, and one relevant piece ofevidence. I call Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we should be able to send out a probe of our own, trace itback to the origin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where's that sonic driver? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly, Worf and I will stay here and look for <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That will all be up to the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They don't want to take on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pinocchio is broken. Its strings have been cut. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not going to be any easier tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lethal? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you'd be better at something like that. Or Beverly. Sheknew him the longest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not now, Kazago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it is and yet it isn't there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint Station? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You make it sound poetic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are there any messages missing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you feel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. They are firing on the Argus Array. They destroyed it,sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's our acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse andtop warp speed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We will use our tractor beam to tow you to the nearest base. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro Laren. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We might regret this. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, but if Troi was right, we were veryclose to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They probably want to see what we're so interested in over here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what is its alert status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'd be gods, which we're not. If there is a cosmic plan, is itnot the height of hubris to think that we can, or should, interfere? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Chief Engineer. It still has a nice ring to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Scott, Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar,and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable ofkilling. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Mintakans are beginning to believe in agod <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If this is because your mother objects? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it's very pleasant, but that's not the point. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what did you think of the Antedeans,Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: His style of command is just different. Klingons believe inobedience and a strict formality of command. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We weren't sure how we would be received. Director Mandl wasless than enthusiastic about our interest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Without trust, there's no friendship, no closeness. None of theemotional bonds that make us what we are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mistress Ariel, I hear the words but not the sincerity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She was on the ship with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything from the surface? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete your record scans and reportback here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The T'Pau is missing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, sir. It was either this or arguing till hell frozeover. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring the engines online and take us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I'll do everything in my power to make this as painlessas possible for both of us. Do you assist your husband in his work? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you remember anything specific about us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, we've been through this. We tested the exocomp and itfailed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may kick usout of the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Dokachin, the information I need involves a matter ofmajor importance to the Federation. I'll need access to your logs, yourfiles. My people can do the work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their last message said they were attempting to crash land on one of the planets in the Mericor system. We should arrive in just under seven hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why do you sound so surprised, MisterO'Brien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Chief, do you have them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You sure? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's also one other thing, a diary with only <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It killed Malencon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. Thanks for the game. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These are the best quarters we have. I was hoping now thatyou've had a chance to relax you might have remembered some of thedetails about the aliens you saw. Something you may have forgotten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading anyfurther. But we still have alien symbols floating around on ourcomputer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen thesethings all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive andnon-functional. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For safety reasons, we're shutting off all power to theHydraulics room before entering to recover the body. Then we'll beamhim up to Sickbay, but from the look of his wounds, it's probablyhopeless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We may need to attempt a long rangetransport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to have to tell them something. Open hailingfrequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's no wonder, with all this going on. Try to relax. This is a confession given by me, Jean-LucPicard, commanding Stargazer, in the hopes that my belated honestywill be taken into account by Starfleet when judging my actions duringa confrontation with an unidentified vessel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm the photons, Mister Worf. Lock on thecentre of the vortex. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by. Stay here and cover La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I had a lot of time on my hands when I was down on thatstation. There were days I felt so alone I thought I might lose mymind. Do you know how I made it through? I thought if I hung on formore day, they'd rescue me. Maybe I'd see you again. I guess thingsdon't always work out the way you expect them to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the big chair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or the away team's tricorders. Right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I take it the Captain was able to negotiate an agreementmutually beneficial to both parties. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your impression of the fieldmodulator, Mister Lote? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. I'm here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, maybe. The point is, I didn't get the chance. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've stabilised life support. Mister La Forgeis working on restoring the main power couplings, but that'll taketime. It's a real mess down here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Twenty two minutes if they stay at current speed. If we can'tbring them out of warp, we'll do as much damage as we can before wehave to disengage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, the game is five card stud, nothing wild. Ante up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, launch another probe. Patch the monitor through to themain viewer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've only been there once, but they've got this great club. Idon't remember the name of it. They serve these blue concoctions <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your zoo? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But still, to seal someone inside a class eight Probe and launchit off. It's a hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're bringing up the rest of the cargo now. We should be readyto leave within the hour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've regained magnification of the life form. It's divided again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Imperative? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or more? You never told me that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Possibly disassembled components, identified as Vulcan,recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They were so small, and they lasted only a second. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Janaran falls. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does he have evidence? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try. TenForward. Our mistake. Remaining transporter functions are beingtransferred to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you treat it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm not intruding, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but by that time both of them had been found out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so circumspect? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I prefer brains over brawn as well. I think it's a waste ofeffort to test our combat skills. It's a minor province in the make-upof a starship captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, wait a second. Thank you, MisterWorf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't just sit here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but she's not the Enterprise. With all due respect, sir,you need me. Particularly now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We mean you no harm. We have injured crewmen in theshuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three days, no transporters. We'll never get them out in time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're a very lovely young lady. But none of this is real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait. I've got it. William. It's a great name. William O'Brien. It's got a nice ring to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, bet it all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches and Bularian canapés. Areyou up for a promotion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a good deal of interference,but you are getting through. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is she serious? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know that, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in theauthorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe thatthey're corrupt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay concerned, please. The safety of the Enterprise may beentrusted to these two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened to your predecessors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't me. I wasn't the one who closed the door. I didn'tproposition her and I certainly didn't try to rape her. Why are youdoing this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gladly. But first our starship. Can you release it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Outpost Sierra Six confirms our readings,sir. They identify it as a Romulan scout ship. Bearing two seven zeromark one four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tailor made for their enemies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is a result of the experimental interface? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think it's just trying to make contact with us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you'll brief him on what he needs to know? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by phasers and photon torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Still no sign of them on long rangescanners. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When I used it before, what happened? I saved most of our Bridgecrew. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, Data has found something interesting. The Aldean shieldgives evidence of random fluctuations, weakening its structure inisolated sections. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Scan it now. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't help but feel I should have come forward a long timeago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't need explanations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're receiving a distress signal from aCardassian ship near the Demilitarised Zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A second transporter signal? From where? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, at least the waiting's over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have apparentlyintersected with something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Muktok live for hundreds of years. Here it is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. Mister Worf, if you're worried that they might learnabout what happened on the Klingon planet <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At warp two? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drop your weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did you like command? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've received communication fromthe freighter Lalo, as well as from a farming colony on Coltar Four. Both described the same time distortion. The Captain of the Lalodescribed it a hiccup. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lasers? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. And I you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I saw him on the ship too. I also saw him here in the hospital,but I don't know who he is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we risk going in there to get them out? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm fine. I'm just <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks, O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the experiment? Do you think we're going to find thattoo? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can believe what you like. We're going to find our peoplewith or without your help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pull yourself together. Worf! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you think this quantum fissure is nothingthat we need to worry about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Head injury? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now's not the best time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, you know I would never act like that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kelso, can you get them off? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not yet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our engines are new, sir. Top condition. The tests on thoseolder ships may have simply been to straighten out some engineinefficiency. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How could a ship disappear from your depot? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Iceman's finally melting. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Talarians are movingRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very tasty. So tell us, Lwaxana. The last time we met, you werelooking for a husband. Did you have any luck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. Stand by to transport to the Enterprise. Here we go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was hoping you might know his business partners. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a message coming in for you from thesurface. It's coded personal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Wesley, reverse our direction, set a course for theCornelian star system. Impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need replacement personnel, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf will help you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing yet. The pod is thirty two hours overdue. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Friend? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The injured Borg immediately self-destructed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Somehow, they're different. Let's get back to the ship. We'lltake them with us. Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We'd better return to ourship now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any response to our hails, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What were you doing accessing the propulsion system files onStardate 44758? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And others of your kind have the same ability? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do I do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? I just asked if they would talk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll only need few minutes, Mister Worf, because you're goingto prepare another surprise for them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Be as casual as you can. Let us know when you'reready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Start gathering everybody together. We've seen this before. Weknow what it is. Now get moving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously we've underestimated their technology, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Delusional? It was not a delusion. I was there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're on a timetable here. Where's Ro? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The words that Data recognised in the computer, boundary,border, road, they were all arranged in this design. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shut down thrusters. Ensign, take us to one thousand metresahead of the barge and hold. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want Mister Clemens kept under escort at all times. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have the ophidian. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit. Set course for the Barradas system, warpsix. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That sounds like that'll use up a lot of warp energy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. I'm looking for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's make it look good. Ensign, release the inertial dampers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess it's better to be lucky than good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand, but there are other departments waiting to use thearray. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And five years later, the away team that was investigating theirdisappearances have started to disappear themselves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Watch that door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There doesn't appear to be a base. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know Rebecca Smith? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Infamy? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Because they're not through coming after us. Wesley, Geordi,prepare to warp jump. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the Brittain, all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you intend to do, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no vegetation, no insects, not even soil bacteria. Itleft nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did you do it, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could that be leakage from their engines? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look, I feel the same way. We all do. But if anything's going toget done. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your little toy worked. Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been on my own since I was fifteen. I can take care ofmyself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lowering shields. Engage tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But Captain <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three weeks away, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc Picard? You know the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Friendly, isn't she? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. May I be excused now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Multiple phaser shots, Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Captain Picard is safely aboard. Fire phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've taken the Engineering qualification three times. You'reno closer to passing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Does that mean he'll be able to <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare firing sequencing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, wait. Let me get this straight. Deanna was impregnated by bywhat? Doctor, what do the tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Kolrami's right. You've got to save theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, scan left and magnify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's an interesting twist. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Menthars hide them in floating debris. An unsuspecting enemyship flies in. Instant booby trap. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've shown none of the concern that Captain Picard would forthe safety of his ship, the welfare of his crew. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. This couldn't have waited a moment? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. We're here on a mission of peace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf,prepare to return fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are not impressed by your magic tricks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailingfrequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: for it was such a badly written book, filledwith endless cliché and shallow characters. I shall welcome death whenit comes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's no use. They've already adapted to the new frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't exactly sworn my undying allegiance to you either,Baran. For instance, I'd like to know a little bit more about the job. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Attacking? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Course set by whom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to check it out. Has there been any word? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. With your permission, I've decided to stay on board theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even for your newly improved phasers? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What woman would have him with an ego like that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If that reading is right, there is no seal. Give me lab interiorimage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're saying we're going to stall the Hathaway? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that all? I thought you'd been walking around with that smileon your face a lot longer than that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge, this is Commander Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to cut the barge loose. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You didn't take any cards. You must be holding something. Whynot make it a little sweeter? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. You can't just snatch people and put them in your fantasiesand expect them to respond. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold on! We're going down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. Itcan be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't that gagh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible. It's like looking into infinity, sir. Remember thecourse in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? About the time menstill believed the Earth was flat? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get them out of there, O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Troi, you've been at it enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened to them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All he wanted to know about was previous starships. What Ithought was innovative about the last Enterprise, the one before that. He said he wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There is the option. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suppose so. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't have a psychology degree, but if you'd like to talk? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A bizarre incident just took place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't let you do this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what did you do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Full boat, kings over. I'd like to thank you both for your verygenerous contributions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You claim to be an advanced society, and yet you resort toexecutions in order to suppress those who don't share your views. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Job? Which job? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, evacuate Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There is one thing I'd like to do first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no way we can override. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Belay that order, Captain. I'll bring her in manually. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, yourtouch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think seem soreal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your name? Tell me you love jazz. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any indication of the probe's energy source,Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The southern polar region. That's where Datatried to move the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll do the best I can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Cardassian ship is powering its weapons and it'stransporters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're transporting endangered animals from Corvan Two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, keep moving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It appears they're trying their best. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Certainly. We can step into the Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm in command of this vessel. Who are you and on whoseauthority do you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are others who would like to visit here, if you would giveus a limit on the numbers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be fine. I've been preparing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How was the racquetball? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. I'm Commander William Riker from the FederationStarship Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's impossible they could be draining all power from allsystems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None that I'd care to share with an audience. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when Acamar's medical database isonline. Riker out. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for this. You want power? Here's power. Rikerto Ensign Gomez. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're not taking those Vulcan ships home with them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mrs Troi, I have to ask you to clear the Bridge, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You might want to have a look at this, Captain. Could be a linkto the disappearance of the colonists. It was displayed in the lab, nodoubt by proud parents. It could be just a child's imagination, butseveral children did similar drawings. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bet it all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare for precision <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's nice to have you here, Ensign. There will be a briefing andindoctrination session in fifteen minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Mister Worf. We have an obligation to render aid. Report to the transporter Room with all necessary gear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. We'll discuss this later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if you did? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need to know if there are other survivors on the surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Earth. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open a frequency to Colony Operations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where was it in the Captain's quarters, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How much do you remember? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean you change according to whatever man you're with? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any word from the Jaradans? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker of the Enterprise. Crewmembers. May I comet down and approach you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Corrosion, then? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You stopped them. You gave us our shot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could we have two coffees, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you have me at a disadvantage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. Setcourse for 'audet Nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors are picking up an <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought seven and eleven had value. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Access all available technical schematics on LieutenantCommander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I could get us on the Enterprise. I can find the artefact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Response? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You've got the Bridge. Keepyour eye on them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right then, we'll stand. The important thing is that westart talking. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. Sorry to interrupt, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As you were. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, discontinue radiation warning till further notice. It's all yours, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data and our guest appear to betardy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm not interrupting. RO + <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't listen to me. Forget the fact that I beat you in thirtymoves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, our communicators are out too. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Minister, I thought I should let you know that the mercenaryship which has been raiding planets in the Taugan sector is probably onits way to Vulcan right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. We're all here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reflection therapy, then. When do we begin? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No sign of a temporal distortion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock on photon torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can reach that in forty two hours at maximum warp, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I know this much. We can't avoid the future. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think we could have gotten it anycleaner. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice work, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our intentions have not changed, Endar. We're returning him toStarfleet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Superior? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We lost Tasha on an away team under my command. The thought ofthe same thing happening to her sister <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you read that, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My broken arm. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's something the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes. Indubitably, Data has been studying him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Earth Station McKinley has advised they're ready to beginrefitting the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any sign of the Essex? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's an order. Return to the ship as soon as you're finished. I'll signal for transport as soon as I can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alert sickbay to prepare for possible casualties. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data has agreed to join me on theaway team, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data,prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Doctor Pulaski, Lieutenant Worf. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would they want to take a Federation hostage? Their fightdoesn't involve us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're scowling, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's trying to project something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: By treaty, that world still belongs to the Sheliak. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your ten and ten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can continue to bypass the part of the computer that'saffected, but if the nanites are spreading through the whole the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You hit him pretty hard, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds pretty routine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't given up yet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Captain, we may have foundsomething. There's a file of memory <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can't be serious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, everybody. Back off, back off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not telling me might affect my decision. Did you think of that? We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it allworks out. I've got to do something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This looks like the front door. Should we ring the bell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why can't we go around it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm available, Mister Remmick. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we weren't over there, where the hell were we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've already contacted the Klingon High Council. You'll bereturned home as soon as we finished our investigation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Station keeping. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They might have attacked before we got here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Most people think so. But that's the kind of question that wouldtake a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planetwhere the people have no gender? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what's going on down there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we are, it will be in battle, and I will die with you. So Irepeat, cloaking shields off! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If they pull down our shields, we're helpless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've reached the outer regions of the Beta Stromgren system. Oncourse for orbital intercept of Tin Man, eighteen minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We demand that you return our crewmember immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Me? Forget about me. How are you? No word, no message, nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've sent out twelve teams so far. I've gotyour team searching section gamma two four. Worf and I will take thetaone six when the last team comes down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The other members of the Q continuum kicked you out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fifty, right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks to me like you need a break. Unwind a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. We have an open channel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See if that did the trick. No, it's not working. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the exact position listed in the Tripoli log. Do yourecognise anything, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We wait. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. If I pick a minorsubsystem, something non-essential. Like this. Warp field phaseadjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interferencegenerated by the warp engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have attempts been made <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I'll just have to muddle through. So forgive me if a strayhe or she slips by, okay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why the body suit? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Great work, Doctor. Now, if I can get out of here, I'd like toget back <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't know where they came from? Where they are now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Please. What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll check it out. Mister Worf. Doctor Pulaski, join us inTransporter room three for an away detail. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure I'll find everything I need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've notified Starfleet that our survey of sector three seven six two eight will be delayed at least a week while we drop off survivors from the Denver. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is different. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, identify the occupant of the detention cell. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There must be only four minutes left. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I checked in with Wesley and Geordi a few hours ago. Therewas a moment when I actually thought that the two of them were going tohit one each other. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you mind telling me what that is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How's it going? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not that simple. This was his crew. He wrote the book onthis ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate prefire sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare for impact. Medical personnel, report to the Bridge. Commander Data, check all systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate search of grid one six three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is our mission? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All transporter rooms are standing by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've lost our thrusters. Attempting to compensate withsecondary boosters <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here's the situation on El-Adrel. The entityhas moved off several hundred metres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate a radio link to the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell is happening? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Another mask. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Snips and snails and puppy dog tails? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Time to intercept? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You must have been asleep, Portal, for hundreds of thousands ofour years. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've located the <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stars whose planets are their defence system? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you waiting for? Raise the shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what happened to the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about beingon a starship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have my father to thank. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No wider than a proton but with gravitational fields as powerfulas a black hole. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, what's the closest we come to the Cardassian borderon our current heading to Valo Three? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're a mission that has no apparentpurpose. In itself, I can accept that. All of us can, because theCaptain says it's important and we trust him. Then he runs the crewthrough efficiency drills for the first time in my tour of duty, but hesays we need them, so we need them, because we trust our Captain. Butwe also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've never explained my orders before. I'mnot about to start now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. How do you think we handled this before? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She resides in the Old Quarter of the FirstCity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll get only one shot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wanted to apologize for my remark in Ten Forward. Yourpersonal is none of my business. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instantto be in two places at once. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can send one of our own shuttles, but its energy would alsobe absorbed. Our Chief Engineer is working on a way to maintain thepower reserves long enough to rescue your crew. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tactical analysis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report to the Observation Lounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't see it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been studying this ritual of yours. Do you know what I've decided? I think it's despicable. I hate everything about it. The casual disregard for life, the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour. I may have to respect your beliefs, but I don't have to like them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Top of the line. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: TV? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I have lost my memory, how do I get it back? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First of all, android or not, I wouldn't ask anyone to take thatkind of risk. Second, if the computer is not working in Engineering,I'm going to need your help to get control of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do I keep my eyes open, or closed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, Lieutenant Yar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand down from Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You didn't have to. I knew. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll do my best. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what does that leave us? Right. That's what I thought. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare your security team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No problem, Professor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't do this. Soren! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold it! I gave you an order, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Please take that to Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ah, the class reunion. You saw a few old friends who had alreadytaken the test? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood, Captain. Doctor. Mister LaForge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're certainly being thorough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For a man in his position, he doesn't seem to know much aboutthe situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They couldn't have adapted that quickly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Borg usually collect their dead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. Be prepared to beam back before the Captain returns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Heading for home. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I say we turn him over to them. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just want you to know that I have the utmost respect for thelaw. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not if we can help it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, it's just <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just don't be late for your shift. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Then they can't communicate with their man either. They won't beable to beam anyone through the field. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make every effort, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's normal procedure when entering into a suspicioussituation. It's not an act of aggression. The Enterprise will not firefirst. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just down this corridor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The son of a Klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade. True? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've been at war for so long, it has become personal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A new message from Karnas, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who's your superior officer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They would see that as deception. I must meet with them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who would want a Vulcan ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, perhaps there are a few things we should talk about. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They haven't been able to maintain reliable communications sincetheir government fell apart. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Imzadi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's a musician, for one thing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, are we going to have those shields anytime soon? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would appreciate it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wallace and Towles. Ready? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, the interior of the house? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like a juggernaut, it could begin moving at any moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I don't know. Put us back on our original heading, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, adjust course for any deviations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is it. There's the core, over there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've made yourself very clear, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: nuqneH. qaleghneS. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Recognise anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And death? One of the symbols was death. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep trying, O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The problem is, Imzadi, I couldn't. Not now. Call it an oldEarth tradition, habit of the beasts, whatever. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have to tell them something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge. Hull temperature falling. We're in the clear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we are on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything? Then why did you kidnap me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We know that you're involved. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Tamarian ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't give the alien any more time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just like the Brittain. Captain's log, stardate 44639.9. The Enterprise hasnow been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent subspace distresscalls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a responsefor at least another two weeks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, how's it coming? What the hell is that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? You were reported headed for <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That means Uhnari is a coalescent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are we still docked at the starbase? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. You don't know how many times I thought about you,about us. For weeks after the evacuation, I kept thinking they'd find away through the distortion field and come back for me. I even thoughtwe'd meet on Risa like we planned. But days went by and nobody came. Then I realised why. They thought that I had been killed in the beamout. No one came down because they thought there was no one to comedown for. So I figured that they'd had a memorial service for me. Somehow that made me feel better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're receiving an emergency distress signalfrom the Solarion Four colony. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Alaska. I was nine years old. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not exactly. You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Thosevouchers are only good at your bar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a risk I think we have to take. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That isn't necessary. The ship will clean itself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we can throw away the visor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, put controls on the restraining arm. A control panel. Lights. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yet this hole has a form, Data. It has height, width. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage forward shields thirty five percent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tricorders? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it dangerous? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're having trouble contacting your government directly. We hadto start somewhere. If you would let me talk to your <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have beenfugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf. In the meantime, takeus out of range. Ensign. Thrusters only, one hundred kph nice and easy <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any requests tonight? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And they call that a small demonstration? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You look pretty good for someone who's been eating sickbay food for three days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you like to transfer backRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have some holodecks which you might enjoy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drugs. They injected me with me drugs. See if the drug's in mysystem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would explain these costumes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There is a solution. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was afraid you were going to say something like that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One hundred twenty five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge, on the double. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not the Captain I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps, Data, perhaps. Thank you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're a wise man, my friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, take a look at this. These are thecoordinates of the eruptions, and these are the coordinates of thephaser drilling sites. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. A Ferengi cargo ship that went down in the Hanolinasteroid belt. The debris was spread over a hundred square kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The seismic activity makes those caverns very unstable. In myopinion, it's too risky. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Neither have I. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's our position, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unfortunately it will have to be a shotgun wedding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On the Bridge. Not this time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. She's a woman of very strongly held opinions, sir. What washer previous assignment? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your two, and three hundred more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset theincreased radiation and magnetic fields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to push that barge into the Gamelan sun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: or that you might think that was a line. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is he? Where's Barclay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well as soon as these negotiations are out of the way, you and Iare going fishing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. As soon as you complete the repairs, I want you backhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, extend shields around shuttle one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's hard to accept. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could they have beamed an explosive device aboard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And it showed up as an explosion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alexander, can you hear me? Alexander? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, God, no. I came that close to winning, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Babyface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Mister La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, we've got twenty two minutes. I want some options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it looks like we got someone's attention. On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Ensign, lay in a course for Indri Eight, warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tai chi chuan. It's called the crane block. Now let's trysomething else. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, people do not have internal chronometers. Why don't yousee what happens if you turn yours off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're better than good. Great. Brilliant. It's going to be fun. Carry on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. Leave it, I'll take a look at it later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's better than standing around helplessly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Formidable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go, let's go. Keep moving. Deeper into the cave. Come on. Deeper into the cave. Keep moving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need those phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Question, sir, could it be this Q? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's a senior Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In time for what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise? my son you created it all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Contraband. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Success. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, take him directly to Sickbay, and notify theCaptain once you're on board. Let's get to work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we have that done before we arrive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's a man who lives his life by his own rules. He does what hedoes by choice. By his choice. Someday you'll make yours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Disengage tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data believes that by sending Worf back through the fissureagain, it would return us all to our proper realities. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Someone was here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Groppler, I could have sworn it wasn't here a minute ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. One to transport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, did you have a nice vacation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dealer folds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The lines. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were at the Academy together. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My God. They're delivering more of them for the others toingest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect aCardassian ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's moving, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When you spoke of the prisoners, you used the termrevolutionary. Indeed, death has been known to stop revolutions. But Isuspect it's not a revolution that Angel One is hoping to stop. It'sevolution. Mister Ramsey and the Odin survivors did not initiate thewaves of dissent that are rippling through your planet. Their presencehere merely reinforced the change in attitudes between men and womenthat was already well under way. They became symbols around whom otherswho shared their views could gather. You may eliminate the symbols, butthat does not mean death to the issues which those symbols represent. No power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution. Bewarned. The execution of Mister Ramsey and his followers may elevatethem to the status of martyrs. Martyrs cannot be silenced. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very good. We'll start with that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got just the thing. Why don't you join me in Ten Forward? There's something I'd like you to try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look, we're not here to make accusations. We're trying to findout what happened. Commander Morag is due here in two hours. Let's seewhat he has to say. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard security sweep shows nothing out ofthe ordinary. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This man's taken, get your own? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coils here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, do you read me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which has to do with another law that we must obey. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I have to agree with the Counsellor. If you want to getahead, you have to take chances, stand out in a crowd, get noticed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you going to tell me that little boy's a threat? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Negative, Mister Worf. Mister Data, your final report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody apromotion and call it a night, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something else, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's lying! That never happened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's why you set up the engine failure, because you knew thatI'd be able to fix it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Charming woman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then let's set it and get going. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you can't stabilise the life support, we're going to have toevacuate the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Close call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engines? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wanted to give you something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And now they're here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're far more charitable than I would have been, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll look this over later. Go ahead. You run your diagnostic. I'll inform the other departments about the power systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's an object of some kind closing in on our position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you know him, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That is enough, Counsellor. Deanna. I'm sorry. This is not aboutrevenge. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight fornothing. Somebody has to answer for that. Then I can mourn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed onthis ship lately? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have the sequence locked in, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker out. Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space,it'll be a few days before Starfleet can get any ships here. Untilthen, we're on our own. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I can't tell you that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losingcontrol. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague andwith destroying us. I didn't see anything that suggested they wanted toassimilate anybody. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon system, even in acomputer mock-up, can't hope to defeat the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Doctor Timicin. You have a visitor coming aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was just assigned here this morning. I was working downtown. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. I think you'dbetter come out here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I felt like I was disconnected. Like it was something I haddreamed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what's this about? Remmick is going to turn this shipupside down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What kind of services? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander. I'll see what I can do to find you some more timetomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Help me locate Wes. He's wandered off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've reached the core, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski. I'm theFirst Officer, Commander William Riker, and this is <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, I think we should call it a night. That's an order. We'll reconvene at oh five hundred. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when you realised, what then? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's get to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But that's our boy. Approximately five times our mass andcarrying enough armament to pulverize a planet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set course for Beta Kupsic. That is still our destination? Velocity, warp factor five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Stand by phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors seemed to think there was. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what proof? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? Captain, I've got you. It's all <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None of it makes any sense. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer locate Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a Ventaxian leader on the viewscreen, name of AcostJared. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, be careful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've heard of him. I don't know that any of us have <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying you trust Tomalak? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll prepare an away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to any team leader. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My girl. What's a knockout like you doing in acomputer-generated gin joint like this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, join us in Transporter room three. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. And it's not going to be easy to find out. ThePrytt have consistently refused all outside contact. We're going tohave to work through the Kes. Contact Ambassador Mauric. Tell him Iwant a meeting right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is Captain Picard? What have you donewith Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you plan to get our people out of Prytt territory? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You needed me, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Armstrong, you and the others prepare tobeam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And us right along with them. Captain's log, stardate 44359.5. What began as acurious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At currentspeed, the two-dimensional beings and the Enterprise will be drawn intothe cosmic string fragment in seven hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what if we forced an discharge through the impulsereactor. Would that be enough to get us out of here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not there any more. What's left of that deflector is laidout on the floor of our cargo bay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to let this thing keep drilling into him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It'll be interesting to see how they improve a computer asadvanced as ours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I speak frankly? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam over. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Admiral Raner? How many other people know about this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors at maximum sensitivity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To be honest, I can't think of a good reason. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about plain old basic sex? You must have some need forthat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't know Barclay played the violin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if the Romulans are already aware of the tachyon field, theyshould run the blockade at that point. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Theirs was armed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When will the emissaries arrive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is not a case of simple fatigue. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've a standard three shift rotation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What battle? When? Which sector? Which unit? Mister Data, if weleft immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost twenty three? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dead? Injured? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you wish to evacuate any non-essential personnel to theEnterprise, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're an excellent Chief Engineer, Lieutenant La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And there is nothing you <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Jellico. We've arrived at the shuttledeparture coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, have you found it yet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd love, to but I have other plans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice shooting. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, you can't assume the intent was belligerent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Franklin's dead, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In fact I might like to say a few words. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The play's not till tomorrow night. I've still got twenty fourhours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's a long time alone in the dark. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All went well on Starbase twelve. I think you'll find the shipto be in splendid condition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want some answers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set them on stun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are slots along the wall, kind of like compartments. Thereare two Borg in each. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How would that help? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then do it. Deanna, help him. I want something by oh ninehundred hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Paul, I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Whydo you want to know so much about my ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then send in your own probe, Goss. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you noticed anything unusual? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep me informed. The sooner we find out what the Klingons thinkthey saw, the sooner we can get the hell out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm phasers and prepare to lock on target. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any known instance of Romulans using E-bandcommunications? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I must say I've come to the same conclusion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do me a favour. Be careful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what would make him change his mind? Why would he leave theship now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have. It wasn't easy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It obviously wasn't pilot's error. I think it demands a responsefrom us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You, of all people, should know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would she lie like that? She was lying. You could tell. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't talk about legal rights. Your jurisdiction is basedentirely on the threat of violence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, because it's polite. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In fact, we have no idea where it is. We thought the last knowncoordinates were a reasonably good place to start. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So Klingons did board the station? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The aliens. Mister Worf, are the photons ready? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter code fourteen? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is no way to live. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Time to impact? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our job is not to police the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their main computer is off. All sensors reveal that all of theequipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send anymessages. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Too dangerous. We've seen what those tunnels look like. Youcould easily be cut off from the rest of us. Worf, if we <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Let's do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing you can do will change the fact that I'm innocent. I'mnot crazy. I'm not <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One of their ships must already be en route. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. Please report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See if you can increase the oxygen level. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And here we are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Neutral, and uninvolved, sir, in virtually all interstellarmatters of consequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any signs of mental stress or trauma? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Never mind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something's happening. They're leaving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's considered an honourable way for a Klingon to die, asuicide that takes an enemy with it. Which one of them was it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's not allowed. Your orders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As his ship was destroyed, he'll be using one of our shuttles. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recognise it. This is Data's poetry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface. A witness said they saw you vaporised. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Don't stop, my friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They seem to be in an awful hurry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Senior officers, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering is modifying one of our subspace resonators toact as a new engine core. It won't do more than warp two, but it'll getthem home. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, how believable do you find that crystal thing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm First Officer William Riker,Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, do you realise the position you're putting me in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me. You're entitled to that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, where are you going? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a Federation ship. one three zero five dash E. It's theYamato, our sister ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it's something Troi warned me about when we first startedto see each other. A Betazoid woman, when she goes through this phase,quadruples her sex drive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see whathappened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There never are, Lieutenant. I'm going to trust your expertise. Secure your stations. Stand by for my signal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I believe it may have happened before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've lost him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Get it fixed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, prepare to put us in orbit above those coordinates. Captain Picard to the Bridge, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. We're only making educated guesses about theirmotivations, no more than that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is all that was left from their computer system. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many morejolts like that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will discuss that with your captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Steady on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise is in orbit. I had them beamed aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pair of threes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You haven't used my first name once, Paul. You remember it,don't you? You don't, do you? Because you don't exist. You're a fake. You're an image of the original, aren't you? Answer me! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe you just need to sit and talk with her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's been going on for over twenty years. Doesn't look like it'sgoing to end any time soon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I never did anything to stand in his way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't put it past them. I think we should prepare for thatcontingency. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would never hurt you, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I don't understand what he's going to do. How can hemediate without his interpreters? He won't even be able to talk tothem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir, I'm sure they all died with honour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse speed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you warn him before the attack was made? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know what you thought you were doingin there, but you were way out of line. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not turning into a philosopher, are you, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It just sort of rolled in on us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any time, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have any idea what caused this, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do we return their fire, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we need a working solution in aboutfive minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very convincing, but not perfect. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They will also listen to the reports of the Captain of theEnterprise and his First Officer. And I can tell you right now theFirst Officer's report will go something like this. Kesprytt, a deeplytroubled world with social, political, and military problems they haveyet to resolve. The Kes, while a friendly and democratic people, aredriven by suspicion, deviousness, and paranoia. It is the opinion ofthis officer they are not ready for membership. Now, the matter of ourmissing officers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where will that take us, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're on the edge of the Neutral Zone on impulse power, andyou're not concerned? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Boarding or disembarking? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You should've moved the bishop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who are you? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open shuttlebay doors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long can we maintain communication? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's gone, Captain. We can abort the auto-destruct. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Federation will not start a war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Confused. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're approaching the shuttlecraft. The creature is covering it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Picard Manoeuvre. What is the defence against that, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe you're right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As your read out shows, this is anunusual place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sickbay, this is the Bridge. We are ready tobegin loading. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you need, Q? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't. He came on board the Enterprise to brief me when I wasoffered the Aries. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In what way? Haven't you seen how much I regretted not savingthat child? Using the Q power to save her may not have been wrong. Nomore than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldierthings. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's your father. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many more Datas are there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course for the Romulan ship. Let's put up shields andgo to Red Alert. I want to be ready for anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Harmless, but effective. Were you able disable the photons? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I feel like such an idiot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't need to tell you thatinsubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's one thing I'd like to say. I question your judgment. Inmy opinion, your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. We'll take it back to the ship with us. Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45. Despite havingonly a few hours in which to explore Data's home planet we'vediscovered something which may explain Data's beginnings, if we canproperly assemble and communicate with what we've found. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Every bit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock on tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the Ambassador? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Halt. Commander, you and I need to have a conversation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't. I'm prevented from that by a promise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you run a diagnostic on the sensors, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Data? Why all the mystery? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you communicate with him, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we'll have to take it ourselves. We'll use our deflectorsclear a path through the asteroids. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starbase one seven nine, this is the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's a busy man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why is there no record of other future historians travellingback to witness important events? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reduce to half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Gibson, take us to warp eight point eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on a coursefor Lemma Two. However its velocity has increased to warp four pointone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security to cargo bay eleven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain, stay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How about until next time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you realise what you're saying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our Chief Engineer is working on ways to reinforce our tractorbeam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I enjoy a challenge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay there! Eject the chamber on my order! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've locked onto something with markings onit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's been a lot of seismic activity over the years. If theservo-links were damaged we may not be able to. I'll try to tap intothe command pathways. You see if you can access and disable the fileserver. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't use photon torpedoes. An explosion this close couldcripple us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now we know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here byaccident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Success, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have a suggestion. First officer's log, Stardate 43174.2. CounsellorTroi and I are beaming down to Mintaka Three to locate Doctor Palmerand to determine the extent of the cultural contamination. DoctorCrusher has temporarily altered our features and skincolour. She's also implanted subcutaneous communicators so that anytransmissions we receive will be inaudible to the Mintakans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. It smells like a trap. Let's go. Captain's log, stardate 41503.7. We have enteredthe Neutral Zone, where a Talarian freighter has been severely damagedin a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well. at this point, I'll try anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Senior officers, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Request permission for Ensign Crusher to reboardthe Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No? How do I strike you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What ship were you on? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: People don't just appear and disappear. There must be some wayto track her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it had no way to reach us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Family emergency. You don't look like aperson who came here to relax. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Captain Riker of the Enterprise. That is, the Enterprisewhich is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantumanomaly. We think we have found a way to return all of us to our properrealities, but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certainquantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit that signature to younow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What else have we got in the neighbourhood? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we don't get in that thing, I guarantee you don't either. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not as a servant. I told you, I prefer equals. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would you care to join us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mistress Beata, before we see living examples of yourcompassion, may I speak? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Er, Will, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hey! Imzadi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you establish a reading? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our speed is down by twenty two percent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's it, isn't it? We're on equal footing now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll findthem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could it be some sort of tractor beam? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you, sir, are listed as <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't see the connection. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was seven months out of the Academy, my head still ringingwith words like duty and honour. When they turned on him, I thoughtthey were a bunch of self-serving, disloyal officers, so I grabbed aphaser and defended my captain. Two or three others joined us, but itwas clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them. We felt a need to get off the ship. There was a running firefight allthe way to the escape pod. About five minutes after we left the shipthere was an explosion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then why did you accept this assignment? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I'd like that very much. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, sir what would you suggest? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll have to take it into the Raman'sauxiliary control room. Their Bridge is too badly damaged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Later we'll try a flight simulation. Rightnow let's do a systems review. I'll talk you through it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was trying to feed Spot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ben. How you doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep at it. We need those transporters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, lock on the tractor beam. Transporter Chief, prepare tohim beam aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. He will triumph who knows when to fight and when notto fight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm another case for the medical journals, then. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Worf, he's in Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did he mean, he picked the right day? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set course to intercept. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, seen this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want a computer science lesson, Data. Bottom line. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't ask me about surprises. Ask Tam Elbrun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. Mister Worf re-establish communication. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Q? Any idea what he's up to? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Suggestion, Captain. Why don't we execute a long range transportof an away team to assist Doctor Graves at earliest possible moment. We'd come out of warp just long enough to energise the beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your colleague Soren was very helpful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But it's <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was the last one out. The distortion field must haveinterfered with the transport. They lost their signal lock on me. WhenI tried to contact the ship, I couldn't get through the interference. If you check with Starfleet I'm sure they will have recorded that I waslost on that day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Halt! Don't fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I do. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you do know what I mean. The best thing for you to doright now is go to your quarters and read a good book. If you doanything to make the situation any worse it's going to be that muchharder on you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're fine tuned enough to see your hosts gathering in theopen area outside, sir. Three of them are heading for your location. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I beg your pardon, Ensign. I didn't quite catch that. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? What is it? I mean, you must havesome way to repair it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. Sounds good. Then you'll take care of that security thing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was referring to the view. Eternity never looked so lovely. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you reviewed their laws. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Without the battle of the sexes you probably don't have as manyarguments. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the First Officer, sir. If you prepare to shut down yourengines, we can lock on the tractor and beam you over here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the locationof Outpost twenty three, the key to all of our defences in the NeutralZone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're supposed to verify its authenticity, and then I'msupposed to kill you, and I take your place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We sympathise with your situation, but what you ask is notpossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How is that possible? Is something wrong with the sensors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Out of the question. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stop it! What do you want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Spectacular. And a little terrifying. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which begins to explain what happened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor array. Wedon't want a ghost tailing us all the way to T'lli Beta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did you find out? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher, report to Transporter room three. Worf. Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Zorn. Can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I must speak to you privately now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd call that geological instability. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Admiral on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's going to be quite a ride. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Emergency transport. Get me out of here. Captain's log, stardate 46778.1. Commander Rikerhas returned safely from his mission to Tilonus Four. Doctor Crusherhas repaired the damage to his long-term memory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, this is going to have no impact on my report. It was amisunderstanding of the worst kind. We could straighten the entirething out if you would ask Mrs. Apgar to join us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me explain what'll happen to you if you don't tell me aboutthe Vulcan ship. Your right of passagethrough this sector will be revoked and more than that, I will be veryunhappy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drop your shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Children of Tama. I've heard rumours about them for years. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got this one! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, maybe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, we deactivated you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She would have to be to get by on Camor Five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock on tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. But it still seems incredible to me that you couldhave constructed this station so rapidly and so, so perfectly suited toour needs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's under a lot of stress. She's preparing the Cairn to meetwith the Federation Council. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about my people? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't sound convinced. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call the cavalry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Someone sure stripped this place. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Two, three days. Do you have to hold that thing that close? I'msorry. I've been on edge all day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All of it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that asevidence of hostile action. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We still won't have our shields restored by then. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is more important than Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No ship's crew in sight. No sign ofmechanism or circuitry. No controls or read-outs. This is nothing likeany vessel I've seen before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Manual restart sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is the Bridge. We have arrived at Starbase oneseven nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In accord with the Prime Directive, I've allowed them to holdhim pending the outcome of this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All transporter rooms, prepare emergency evacuation procedures. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Parrises squares? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any signs of life, Mister La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They took this path. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Data would have left a trace imprint when he beamed down? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know what that was all about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have any idea what condition the shuttle crew is in, sowe'll all beam directly to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room three, can you get a pattern lock on CommanderData, Counselor Troi <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you'll follow me, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's incredible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I just opened them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Permission granted. You have the bridge, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The shuttle is <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. We're from the United Federation of Planets. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Define weird. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For the next time we encounter the Tamarians? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is Soren? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deuce. Six. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The remains of another ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And use it as an aiming point and blow our Captain to bits? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we know that, so do the Tamarians. Riker to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this message from Starbase Fourteen? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the Justman, the shuttle Reyga modified. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If anyone can improvise, it's Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It could be one of those ships that was orbiting Dytallix. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drained and taken to Devidia Two for those aliens to ingest? Ifyou were a time traveller with a taste for human neural energy wherewould you get your supply? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tactical? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And we'll experience actual battle conditions? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. What about the luminosity studies? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have more time, Doctor. Once he was wired into theBorg, they knew everything that he knew. I just hope it goes both ways. If we're lucky, he had access to everything we need to know about them,especially their vulnerabilities. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. You're dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you report this, you'll be making a terrible mistake, Doctor. A terrible mistake. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You think we got their attention, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Endure what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Baby? This is a surprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador? We've received word from theSeronian and the Rekag delegates. They've agreed to meet with you inDarthen tomorrow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should loosen things up a little bit, meet in a lessofficial capacity. How about a friendly game of poker? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did he look like? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know what happened to them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess a frontal assault is unwarranted. Stay here. I thinkI'll try an old-fashioned knock on the door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, identify Riker, William T. Accesscode theta alpha two seven three seven, blue, enable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Listen, Miss <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But, sir <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No one's seen him. The replicator in his quarters has not beenused. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bok is trying to use his transporter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room one. I am programming the coordinates. Standby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. See you for dinner. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's ridiculous. When did I have a chance? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The away team's ready, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm serious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lay in the course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see it. Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been thinking maybe Doctor Marr is right. Maybe we shoulddestroy the Entity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders. And I will do exactly that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not unlike commanding a starship, Mister Ral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, fire up the impulse engines. Activate the <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But why the holodeck? It doesn't make any sense. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is what you're thinking possible? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, we don't want to lose you. You're a very good officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll be protected on our ship. You could still be in dangerhere on Rana. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There areRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or a probe. Making them powerless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I feel like an actor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure anyone can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I can distract Orton for a few seconds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell is he doing? Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She left the dinner last night with one of the Ullians. I'lltalk to him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you discussed this with Wyatt? I think you should. It'salso damned unfair to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I won't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You send Mistress Beata our regrets. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My problem, Commander, is I expect to be notified before there'sa change in my orders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll begin our crew survey on decks five through ten. When youget those systems going, try to pull up the personnel files. It'd benice if we all had names. Right. Good luck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vega-Omicron. It'll take months at high warp just to get there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert! All hands to battle stations. Layin a course. Engage warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'll have to be placed under arrest as well. Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautifulsight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics, Sophistry and the AlternateUniverse by Ving Kuda. You call that light reading? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. Actually it feels quite comfortable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I must say I'm not overjoyed to see Remmick again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And it's delicious. Thank you. Good morning, Groppler Zorn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's coming back with us one way or another. Set phasers onmaximum stun. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, First Officer of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He? Data, we don't know that this can become alive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, location of Doctor BeverlyCrusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Display Volnoth's birth record again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Rager and I were lucky to have escaped. LieutenantHagler's dead. Whoever it was sent that thing was more than simplycurious. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going on, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A couple of hours. We have to cut through the bulkhead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our readings were incorrect. The Borg crew survived <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to senior staff. Please report to the Observationlounge. Mission briefing in ten minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley. I am looking forward tohearing about it. But not right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In the novel. Right. How does it end? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: one seven zero one D Enterprise, shuttlecraft five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it certainly was different. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're not staying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Haven't we gotten you a replicator yet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge. I'll check in on you later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maintain your position, Lieutenant. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We thought that since you're going to the same conference, youmight like to beam down with the other delegates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Request flight clearance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even Klingons need love now and then. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You tormented them. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If not battle stations, may we at least take the ship to YellowAlert? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're from a Federation starship. We answered your distresscall. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to ourSickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've done everything I know how. It's nouse. Without Tog's security code, I can't get near their communicationsystem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's hope they stay clear of the colony. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tactical analysis, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When we reach the Hyralan Sector, we're supposed to rendezvouswith a Klingon transport ship. I'm not sure, but I think they may bedelivering another of the Romulan artefacts to us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Ensign, if you encounter any holes, steer clear. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Rather the reverse, sir. But a Captain's life means a great dealto me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you're lucky, you'll only spend the next five years in prisoninstead of the next twenty. You've gottwelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in theKlingon Empire. Tell me what you know, and I'll pull some strings. Maybe they'll reduce your sentence after you've been extradited. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Imagine the Ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Quiet! Does he have it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sounds promising. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fighting off all the species you've insulted would be a fulltime mission. That's not the one I signed up for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who are you? What is your part in all this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, you're with me. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a flyin amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel whichappears to be the Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning,yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team. Hopefully, the answer lies over there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three to beam up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am beginning to remember certain things. Why am I here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A shuttlecraft? Well, here's my offer. Instead of the ship, I'llgive you some time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Easy. Easy. Engage. Captain Okona, shut down your engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Quantum Mechanics doesn't want to give him up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. I'll inform the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge, let's get a diagnostic sweep underway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Clones? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The entire Velara Three facility has been powered down, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise, come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are two others. Where's the Drake? Where's your crew? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's normal procedure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The vessel appears to be intact. They have shields, but it lookslike their subspace systems are out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do these artefacts have some religious or cultural significance,something that would make them valuable enough to kill for? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. Time to intercept? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer. Summarise service record. Riker,William T, Captain. Begin with the Fornax disaster. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've broken through a security field,deck ten, section two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report to Shuttlebay two immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nice suit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could this be some sort of tissue regeneration? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From what I could see, the Ambassador doesn't need to beprotected from anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I actually thought I might go with the name Thomas. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you stay with the deflectors, will they protect you whenthe storm hits? NELLA <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. I was just heading for deckseven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back onschedule. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, we're in position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I should take this to the authorities. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have to agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do,but the risk is too great. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll see to that, and to your accommodations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yuta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Young Wesley, he'd been manning that station for me. I forgot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm still not comfortable with that final speech. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unverified. The solar flares could have caused a malfunction inthe biofilter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They are a sensible race. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The point is, you've completed the upgrade well ahead ofschedule. Very impressive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sooner or later he'll have to feel the burden of command. EnsignCrusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In essence, yes. I find it surprising after all these eons thatthe Aldeans' have not perfected their technology. One would assume theywould be aware of the weakness and repair it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Masquerading as a god? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd better get to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Apgar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And are those scholars saying the Ferengi may not unlike us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Similar conditions. They were monitoring a planet that wasbreaking up, not a collapsing star as in this case. But there were thesame huge shifts in gravity, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we'd better talk in here. The Observation Lounge hasturned into a swamp. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you copy that, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! Wesley, I may know best of all. Our friendship, our longtalks <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that Melor Famagal I hear? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's more than ill, she's in a coma. Doctor Crusher doesn'tknow what's causing it or how to treat her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? Fire. And now, the conclusion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know I didn't get the wrong room. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf would be my first choice, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a long story, sir, but I'm sure it doesn't have anything todo with this accident. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good idea. I've had enough surprises for one day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had to respond to the threat from the core fragment didn'twe? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We should probably get you to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will want to <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. Prepare phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Spacecraft? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How close is it to the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for these games. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recommend you don't fire until you're within forty thousandkilometres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A lot of people near death have talked about strangeexperiences, but I've never heard one so detailed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's nothing compared to what our Captain will do when he findsout you've broken our landing party agreement. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, may I suggest you take this up with Admiral <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, align the Enterprise so we appear to be one of theabandoned ships. Mister La Forge, when we're in position, shut down theengines and all systems except sensors and life support. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I felt no collision. Were we hit by a small meteor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I knew he'd have a great time. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Looks like these Gatherers weren't too discriminating in whatthey steal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Destroy that probe! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, we're going to have to terminate the beam if thiskeeps up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, we're over the first hurdle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait, sir. Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ah, you're wrong, Mister Worf. It's fantastic. And it's ours. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Same one I've always had. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not going to be me. He's made that abundantly clear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Three quarters impulse, full on my command. EnsignNagel, maximum shields. Mister Worf, prepare your little surprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damn it, no. I can't afford to get this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. I write this in the hope that it will someday be read byhuman eyes. I can only surmise at this point, but apparently ourexploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life form whichinfected and killed all personnel except myself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three, two, one, now! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A complete analysis of our bid is availableon the ship's computer for your consideration. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ask them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. We experienced some kind of loop where everythingrepeats itself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Except that they know they've got us in deep trouble. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have relationships with others? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're back, Geordi <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, we need to jettison the entire engine core. You'llneed to extend the shields once it clears the hull. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your name? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? Then I guess adding one more charge wouldn't hurt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come now, Locutus. If Picard's knowledge and experience is partof you, then you know I've never lied to him. You should alsoimplicitly trust me, is that not so? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nor ours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm photon torpedoes and stand by, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's good to see you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something's wrong. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. Securityteam, meet me on deck seven, section twenty five baker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long do we have? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Close to forty kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. It'll take us four months just to get there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't say I'm sorry to hear that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data we've only seen the Crystalline Entity once before. How doyou know these metals will protect us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If only one of his thrusters was out, he could still have setdown somewhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This Bridge should be four decks above us. What's going on here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That doesn't give us much time to retrieve the database. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what do we do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The good times? The first time we met you, you put us on trialfor the crimes of humanity. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, let's get to the surface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll understand soon, Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The crew might still be alive. There's no way we can tell fromup here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've found the wreckage of a small craft. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They have the ability to analyse and adapt, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recommend we fire directional phasers at those coordinates. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we can give the Captain a new bargaining chip. DoctorCrusher, flood the cargo bay with your containment field. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you prepared to use them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I assumed as much, sir. We've also located the remains of ahuman. Request identity scan. Colonel Richey. American. First initialS. Roughly the same time period. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So long, Quark. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll pass along your request. If you'll excuse us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I strongly recommend that we go to Red Alert. If theRomulans have improved their cloaking device, and we'd be fools tobelieve they haven't, we should assume a more defensive posture. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why do they want with me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was a first contact situation. Ghorusdan culture is socomplex and different, that the Federation sent a specialist to preventmisunderstanding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gladly, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, we've got eight or nine minutes at most. Can you finish bythen? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No extraterrestrial source ever used this code? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm trying to. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I'm surprised at you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the Great Hall. Iwant you to lock the transporter. Prepare to evacuate the entire group. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here's your loose panel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What would you do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Engineering, respond. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the shuttle pilot who's on duty is Lieutenant Hayes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Remember, I'm the one who wanted to make Captain by the time Iwas thirty five. I'm a little behind schedule, I'll admit that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, we have a known spy on board and now we haveunexplained signals on board. I think it's reasonable to assume thatthey're related somehow, wouldn't you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Put it through in here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All stations secure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The forms are very similar. Do that move again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, prepare for the beaming operation. We're onour way. Wesley, Data, let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me get this straight. You want me to take off your head? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, what the hell happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Toxic? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What does C forty seven control? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The nodes are deactivating all over theship. Our systems are beginning to function normally again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Family. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir, I'm all right. What aboutRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Warp nine point seven two? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't waste time chasing down sensor ghosts. We shouldprobably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closerlook. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It must be very lonely. A princess in a very high tower. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Valtese ship has arrived. Chancellor Alrik is ready tobeam aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't make any sense. Why would they run into us? And ifthey were, why wouldn't they do it at full speed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Check him out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope some day that the Federation and Daled Four will haveformal contact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From the smell of things, I'd say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stop it. Put that down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: W arrived a little late. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien do you have the Captain's signal? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Return fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: None the worse for wear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're lying! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was doing bat'leth moves with Mister Worf. I jabbed when Ishould've blocked. He caught me right in the side. It's a good thing wewere using sticks instead of the real blades. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd remember him. He would have appeared very strange. Paleskin, gold eyes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have every right to detain him, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can't they go to local authorities? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rewriting history? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabitedplanet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is yourbusiness. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All science labs standing by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That doesn't sound like you, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Finally. Riker. Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But there was a very good chance we would have said yes. ZERO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yuta. Move away from Chorgan. Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What if I snore in my sleep? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Congratulations.<TheHathaway is old,battered, with that nacelledesign of two above, two below)PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have to return to my ship. Come with me. You don't have tostay here anymore. You don't have to be alone anymore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Commander certainly appears to have the crew on its toes <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Elaborate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by to fire, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid that won't be possible. Last night, Jono attackedCaptain Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I knew what I was supposed to do and I didn't do it. If thosehad real bat'leths I might be dead right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about flooding their air vents with anaesthezine gas? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We send him over there for one set of repairs, now they need himfor more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For honour students, only the best. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be glad to be relieved of this cargo. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you'd be alone. Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've said all I can. I am under direct orders from AdmiralPressman not to discuss this, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Listen. This has been educational but I make it a policy neverto open another man's gift. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think a lot about what happened, especially on that last day. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Motivated self-interest. Right now, the best place for me to beis here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, shall I send for Doctor Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think he's on to you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back intowarp, our weapon is useless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We've entered thestructure. Riker to Enterprise, come in. Come in, Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean besides pride. Well, in this case it doesn't matter. Iprobably haven't got a chance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aeons. Have you any idea how far we'll advance? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All decks prepare for radiation protocol. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And I didn't even catch it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No way, not me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep the shields down. We don't want to appear provocative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, get us out of here! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it the Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starbase twenty nine. He had never heard of me, and they had noofficer that fit my description. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll start a pattern search from this point. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Anything else? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, I don't know if you've had a chance to meet ourhost, Commander Hutchinson. Call him Hutch. Lieutenant Commander Data,our second officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What negotiations? What treaty? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Eight years ago, I led a team to evacuate this station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you and Casey get up here. Let's get to it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a pity we can't take them ourselves. Having them on boardis like a visit from the past. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's how you rationalise these attacks? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is ridiculous. You're beginning to see conspiracieseverywhere. We were invited here by the Kes. Why would we allyourselves with the Prytt? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, cut your engines. Take her in unpowered. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One or both? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the strangest feeling. My whole legjust went dead. Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1. During ageological survey on Surata Four, Commander Riker has become infectedby an unidentified microbe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules ofAcquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data foundout that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is themost recent picture we could find. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is going on? JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And that if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean, it wouldfall off the edge of the world? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, let's make a run for it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Etana? I know you're back there. Don't make me come after you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And doesn't have to be told by a woman? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we set up some sort of relay system? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all the power that MacDuff had to alter our brain chemistryand manipulate the computers, it's hard to believe he needed theEnterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship isfalling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty fiveminutes, holodeck and all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not much. The injury reports are increasing too, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You? Tongue-tied? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He needs another fifty seconds for the core to cool down beforeit can restart. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What did he say when you turned down your own command? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic,risking literally everything in the face of our superior power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The fleet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? Computer, emergency order to Transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We need warp power now! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are the Cardassians ready for a war? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We shouldn't have any trouble going higher. The safety overridewill kick in at about ninety eight percent tolerance, and that'lldisengage the interface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How much protection will this cave give us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're getting harder and harder to bluff, Data. You've learnedthis game very well. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm better than you realise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's in that sector? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've received a distress call from theOhniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All deck, this is the Bridge. Brace for impact. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which one is the closest one to the debris coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire torpedo. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would give him authorised access to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Truly excellent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give me a choice then. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. D <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now that's a compliment, Q. But that's not an answer. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will that take? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who? You don't mean Doctor Noonien Soong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates forpeace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it's a vessel of the United Federation of Planets, and Earthis a member. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is he? Wait here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Construction records? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is where we started, if we are us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't suppose that would work with people? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not now, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, what is the power efficiency of the wave? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Without knowing what he did, that'll be tough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, increase power to shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A blood test, a tissue sample, anything thatwould have a sample of Doctor Pulaski's original DNA. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, just some strange sensations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's a good thing. I almost didn't make it off the surface. When can we get started? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just don't want to believe it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's exactly the point. I don't want to heal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, she's bought us some time. Let's make the most of it. I wouldn't do that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to transporter room three. Boost your output and lock onto the two Ferengi on board the shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reset subspace communications. Scrambler code, Riker One <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're saying he's dead? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It seems an equitable code. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, you may not be aware that our normal interface alreadyroutes auxiliary power through three separate relays. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding away to make the computer think someone else is Data? Maybe a fewsomeoneelse's? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. I'm just trying to trace her steps. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their Bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record everything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Staff's waiting, if Doctor Crusher approves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have no recollection of her at all. What was she like? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Love to play, but not with these cards. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lathal Bine. It was your aunt who represented Beta thirty yearsago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You want to try again? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It could be a distress call. Helm, take us into transport range. Doctor Crusher, meet me in transporter room two with a medical awayteam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You went back to the Enterprise for that? Wes, you cheated. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, it's going to be a late night. Would you like to havesome dinner first? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A personal briefing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were lucky. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just hoping this isn't the usual way our missions will go, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine, fine, Enterprise out! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Troi? Is it the same as you felt down there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's more than I expected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know if she'll have time for you, Wes. She's destined torule an entire world. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've gotten out of them before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire thrusters. Gradual acceleration to forty percent power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open a channel to the Tamarian ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you need medical help? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the same Ferengi vessel that entered the Corridor a weekago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I am too. Don't worry about it. I can handle Shelby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope we find them before they come out of their nap. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate intruder alert. All security teamsreport to <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What for? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Injector status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then let's get started. There's nothing more familiar than theEnterprise. Maybe that'll bring back some <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the problem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I told you, he's in the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? Are they willing to go or not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An emergency transponder? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You got called into the superintendent's office? That's a storyI'd like to hear. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened to him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He is busy elsewhere, ma'am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't believe me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get theprobe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reachMarijne Seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What exactly does this device do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Atmosphere? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So they could have appeared on Earth as humans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only one who doesn't seem affected byall this is Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any truth in what he's saying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've brought the Sovereign of Acamar. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good luck, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Move! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computers have always impressed me with their ability to takeorders. I'm not nearly as convinces of their ability to creatively givethem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That was my first thought, but the Vulcans have no record of anystolen weapons or stolen parts, for that matter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not much. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what happens to the colony if she does? If others join her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. What did you find? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've switched to manual control of the air handling system.  PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, First Officerof the Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you say we, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You remember me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep trying. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What brought this up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, that's the only choice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Two weeks? That's not enough time to explore a region that size. I thought we had five weeks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. You did a good job on the Borg ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, you did, from computer twelve B nine, deck thirty six. Thecomputer logged in your identification from your communicator. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But you have the practical experience, Wes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're pulling back to a safe distance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I happen to like poker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You really think Endar would go along with that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How well do you know Spock? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At once, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a risk. We're not sure how stable the rift will be. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we should meet him here. Keep him under our control. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who asks the question? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kazago, you know who controls those spheres. Now I ask youagain, First Officer to First Officer. What's going on? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange for our guests to beam down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Picard to the Bridge. All stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many of them were there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we shouldassume the initiative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This I think you should see for yourself. Bring Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I'm not sure that I would either, Worf, since this isn't aKlingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, that's yourbusiness, but we don't get to Earth all that often. I'm sure we canarrange for you to have more off duty time while they're here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I recommend we destroy the asteroid. It would take most of ourphoton torpedoes, but it would preclude any possibility of the Pegasusfalling into Romulan hands. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who'dfallen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think she's a governess. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How are you examining them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will we be holding position here until it arrives? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now it's time for the long pants. There's your ten, and onehundred. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let it go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A long way from home. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed, sir. Short and sweet. God-like efficiency. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay here, Geordi. Data.  TIMOTHY <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standing by, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There will be members of this crew who willnot want to serve with Ensign Laren, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's taking a sabbatical. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're saying an entire base has already been established there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think this is a random occurrence. I think there's apurpose here. A reason. What, I don't know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the electrostatic conditions are about as good asthey're going to get. If we're going to try this, now's the time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You need rest, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The medication Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find away to keep going. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to holodeck control. Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you don't do it, I will relieve you of duty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pick three more. Okay, now pick one of those. Is that your card? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll bet they are. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Explain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What have you been able to find out about him so far? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, okay's not good enough. When I was your age, my own fatherhe wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wonderedwhat kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea evenscared me a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If there were a way to save the Captain and Geordi withoutdestroying the exocomps, I would jump on it, but we have run out oftime and this is the only solution I've got. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The cloak failed, and half the ship materialised in solid rock. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast anddie hard. The question is, why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now we know what they mean by Advanced Tactical Training. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beam him aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like you've made a friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold your speed, Captain Okona. Disengage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Give us everything you can to close the gap,Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, what do you say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's Commander Riker, sir! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Doctor, would this virus haveany effect on Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have you on our viewer, pilot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This has gone far enough, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Ambassador. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Strongly emphasized. And you can see it in the precise,ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lieutenant Yar too,sir, but maybe we should sit and wait them out. Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full dayof waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether theyare aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we havepinpointed Lutan's government compound. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I grew up in Alaska. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And are these gentlemen the Bynars? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell me what it's supposed to be, then I'll give you my opinion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's out of sequence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So I've gathered. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it's a sign of strength. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What, do you think I'm going to try to escape? What would thatget me? You've already got her. Besides, where would I go? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, but we're finished here. Now, I can allow time foryou and Kevin to pack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mind if I join you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was in a hospital, then I was back on the Enterprise. I wasback at the hospital. I kept shifting from place to place. I couldn'ttell what was real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You may not thank me once you see how much work it entails. Assemble a team, and take a look at the records on the Drema quadrant. There's a mystery here. We've got to solve it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry they startled you, Mrs. Troi. They're Antedeandelegates. They're being stored here temporarily. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The composition of the moon's crust is blocking the sensors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just tell her I'll be in shuttlebay two. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just wanted to broaden his horizons. Besides, he likes it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, Geordi is trying a neutrino infusion. It may smother the reaction. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure Mister Data has a very good explanation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. If you'll excuse me, sir. Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Books. A novel. Hotel Royale? Summarise, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hail on all frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This planet. What do you call it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How can that be? The Professor's data depends on <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's too heavy. I've got to find something to help us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had it. Let's put all this technology to work, figure outwhat's going on, and get the hell out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If they're right, would you be able to use the transporter toreverse the effects? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good idea. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what happens in that futureallows us to change things now, so that some things never happen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Science Station, analyse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander. Captain's mess? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reflection therapy? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe it's about time we found out. Could we use the phasers tomelt down the shell of the comet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold. Irealised we had arrived before they had completed the transfer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were there in the cavern. You know what happened. What am Isupposed to do? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Crusher, send a general hail, all ships. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can call it whatever you like. The fact remains youdeliberately disguised your probes. You made them look like signalmarkers. You hid them in debris field. You mined the Corridor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Couldn't we replicate the elements that Tyken used? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No matter you can say will the fact that I'm innocent! I'm notcrazy! I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's still no indication that he's found the beacon, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Chairman Songi, this isCommander Riker on board the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The last port of call of the Lantree was the Darwin GeneticResearch Station on Gagarin Four three days ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, thanks. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Meaning if I set up a simple oscillation, I can send out asignal. The trick is to create a message that the Enterprise willunderstand but that the Ferengi will think is just normal subspacestatic. What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Help me! Help me!  MAVEK <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you sure? Because I get the sense you're feeling pretty noble about the whole thing. Look at me, aren't I courageous? Aren't I an honourable Klingon? Let me remind you of something. A Klingon does not put his desires above those of his family or his friends. How many people on this ship consider you a friend? How many owe you their lives? Have you ever thought about how you've affected the people around you? How we might feel about your dying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everyone is so concerned about my next job. With all duerespect, Commander, sir, my career plans are my own business, and noone else's. But it's nice to know I'll have a few options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe now we'll find out what they really want. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's not enough time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My life was on the main Bridge. Always has been. If anything'sgoing to jog my memory. Main Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the custom here, running. Lead the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Boost power to the shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was just trying to imagine a hell-bent for leather youngofficer insulting a Nausicaan twice his size. I wish I'd had a chanceto know that Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, give me a location on Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They send out a plea for help, then they cut off transmission sothey can't tell if there's any help on the way. Doesn't make muchsense, does it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm your commanding officer. I'm giving you adirect order. Understood? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I'd be a liar if I said I felt like myself. I've had to bitemy tongue to keep from snapping at people. A couple of times, I've goneto my quarters and felt as if there was someone in there, waiting forme. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. Data, you've got the Bridge. Inform the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to half impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have to find a way to reach him. We must know what he knows <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing. It just fizzled out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase to full impulse. Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam the shuttle crew back once we're in range. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could leave the child here. If Data's right, it would have anample supply of food. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, is there any health risk to Counsellor Troi if thefoetus is aborted? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That means the atmosphere of the planet would instantly rush in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status, O'Brien? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have your favourite wish, my young friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Before Uhnari died or after? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's gone. I tried variations of theprogramme, others appeared, but not Minuet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This time I want someone with you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you come here for something in particular, or just generalRiker bashing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. The play is full of disturbing images. People losingtheir minds, being tortured by doctors. I can't get it out of my mind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach inprogress. Prepare for emergency beam out. GAINES <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Navigational sensors show that we've travelled sixty five lightyears from our previous position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ma'am, excuse me. I really think that you ought to leave. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You may want him here before we're done, sir. He seems to havedeveloped some sort of special attachment to the boy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do we know where these things came from, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I could go a lot longer without hearing it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want the cloning equipment inspected. Who knows how manytissue samples were stolen. We certainly have a right to exercisecontrol over our own bodies. <eos>

 <bos> RIKER: In his quarters? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, start working on the problem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you have this ability to travel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, back off. Well, would anyone else like to speak up? Orshall we end this charade? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No time for courtesy. Get the damned control chips back inplace, in the correct order. Now! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lied to you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I want the Captain out of there now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security, all decks yellow alert. Possible intruder. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Care to lend a hand? Sit at Ops. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Armed with ancient ball and powder muskets? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From inside the Enterprise? You're sure? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What then? How do we get the Enterprises that are already hereback to where they belong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, like you said, our choices are very limited.  RIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data? I understand he's somewhere on this deck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I've already dined. Maybe you know a good Acamariandessert recipe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do have one request, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forget to set your alarm, Wesley? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought that I might show you your quarters first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which explains the Ferengi's interest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't contact the Captain. It could justbe interference, but I'd like to be sure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Admiral Picard. Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You find something amusing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And nothing you or anyone else can say will change that. And I won't let you or anyone else tell me that I am. You may be ableto destroy my mind, but you can't change the fact that I'm innocent. Ididn't kill that man! And that's what's driving you crazy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not like him to the post. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Orton may be improvising. Maybe he didn't plan to take ushostage so early and now he doesn't know what to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you help me get out of here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We found the power source to the shield andwe've neutralised it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At what coordinates? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was looking for Doctor Crusher. I didn't know what nutrientsshe wanted to send with the bacilli. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where's that cat of yours? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standing by, sir. Captain's log, stardate 46735.2. Our frequent useof high warp over the last few days has overextended the propulsionsystems. We are finishing minor repairs before returning to Federationterritory. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Re-establish your firing pattern, Mister Worf. We'll wait fivemore minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess we've piqued their interest now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: how long before they cross over into Federation territory? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've never even seen anything like this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your shields were failing, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Save it. We're getting out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First officer to Enterprise. We've lost Zorn. Something like atransporter beam seems to have snatched him away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On Risa? That vacation must have been better than he let on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, re-enable Bridge control. Securityprotocol, Riker omega Three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The test ship's warp field is becoming unstable. Sensors showmultiple disruptions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were worried about you. I should have known you'd pop up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Says who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if the government doesn't survive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, we fix the shields first. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you warn me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Too real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello, sir. Feeling better? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Third time today. Stand down Red alert. Reduce speed. Return toour patrol route. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whoa. If we're going to get out of here, you're going to have totrust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you gethere? My name is Will. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may kick usout of the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, if we shut down that means we're going to be bringingdown the shields, and we're hanging nose to nose with a Romulan battlecruiser. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Like putting a fish in a bucket of water. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. The name of my ship is the Lollipop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It looks like it's back into that dress uniform, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He promises the method of execution will bemost painful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alert science stations to standby. Tell them to coordinate allefforts with Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you think I'm coming down on you because the Captainoverruled me, think again. I happen to disagree with his decision, buthe is my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's noconfusion, I am your commanding officer and I expect you to do thesame. If you can't, there's no place for you on my away team. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coming to heading three four zero mark one zero. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes! Absolutely! I do indeed concur wholeheartedly! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long before we rendezvous with Captain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This console has tactical configuration? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I. I'm not sure what I'm feeling. What's on your mind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Better jacket the scanning beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to La Forge. Damage report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How's it going? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could return him to the crash site. We'd have to remove hismemory of being on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry ladies. Duty calls. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He'll be here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reunification? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The portable transporter array is in. Whenwe get into null space, we'll need to initialise it before we cantransport the J'naii crew to this shuttle. But there should still beenough power left to beam all of us back to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, am I under investigation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was pretty much as we expected, sir. Nosurvivors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the human race. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energize. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar zero zero six, warp seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The damn thing's feeding off our shields. Mister Data,remodulate our shield frequencies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any correlation with the readings from Earth? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're clear of the strands. We'll have full warp capability intwenty minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare to lock on tractor beam. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, butfrankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closedtheir borders to all Federation starships. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our computer banks are non-negotiable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We know you're behind this, Q. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've established a synchronous orbit over the drillingsite. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That might have been one of the shortestassignments in the history of Starfleet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That won't give us enough time. We need to occupy them longenough for you to install the relay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe it's my music. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've just received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep SpaceNine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess I'm not surprised to hear that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship. Now, come on, Iwant to see exactly what's happening. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what are you suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader ofanother world. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for asilver sphere. Destroy it with your phaser. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At the time I thought it would be more advantageous for me to doa tour on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Warp two, helm. Heading five seven mark three onenine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything we've seen would indicate otherwise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the nature of the problem, Captain? We've lost visual. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. All personnel report to duty stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If this keeps up, it will tear up the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You do now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could anything he's proposing damage our system? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where do you think he's headed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Bringloidi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The point is, they may be reasonable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My colleagues, where are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I didn't. Geordi, I may have seemed a little harsh about thesituation aboard the Raman. I just don't like the idea of one of mybest officers putting himself in unnecessary danger. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, reconfigure high resolution sweep, radius onemillion kilometres. Check for any debris. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any light they have must be artificially generated. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's continuing to regenerate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, you beat him! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No sir. I didn't understand that kind of hostility even when Istudied Earth history. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all respect, Captain, I want to beam over there. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No one was more surprised than I. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd rather not send anyone back down there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of this crew. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These weapons were taken from two of yourpeople who were loitering out of sight in the vicinity of the Selaydelegation quarters. Would you care to explain, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand your confusion. My personal physician is much morefamiliar with these genetic irregularities. To be honest, I would muchfeel better back home under her care. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You will follow Starfleet uniform code aboard this ship, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're lying, Setal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm with you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Glob fly? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your exact message. Bon voyage mon ami. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got a clear path to panel J14 baker. What's that going todo for us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The firomactal drive is powered byPICARD JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker of the Enterprise. Do you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah, that's starting to come back to me. There was no proofincluded. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Didn't I just say that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set course and speed for Star Station India. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's one option. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how are you coming with the surveypreparations? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have a feeling there's more to it than just pleasing us, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley Crusher, this is Riker. Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We would like time to prepare our people for assimilation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay with them, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it's around here somewhere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What we're facing is neither a person nor a place. At least notyet. It's time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm having trouble concentrating myself. It's like my mind keepswandering. I can't <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Area affected? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As soon as it's convenient Captain, I want a meeting with youand your Bridge staff. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open fire, all weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How about at warp seven? At warp eight? At warp nine? What's the matter, Data? What happened to those millions ofcalculations per second? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All senior staff report to the Observation Lounge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher's got everything under control, Geordi. Ifthere's any change, you'll be the first to know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See if you can access the circuits that have been affected bythe nodes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you can imagine how much this means to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Armed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Speaking of time. This may be your time. I shall personally missyou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our values require us to face that possibility. What of you,with your empire gone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bonus? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No objection, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red Alert. Load torpedo bays. Set warhead yields to levelsixteen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do. Things are a little more complicated than I had planned,but there's nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what Iwant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's athletically inclined, loves to climb mountain. He's fromsomewhere called Alaska. He enjoys exotic food, and takes his vacationson a planet called Risa. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why, Data? It's just a derelict. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Actually, I learned quite a bit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think it might have something to do with ego? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That is not the purpose of the mission. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And now it's too late. For you, that is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have no problem getting to sleep. Then Ithink I'm sleeping all night. When I wake up, I feel exhausted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the comm. panel, the replicator. Youcan lower the lights on a verbal command. If you have any questions youcan just ask the computer, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's clear some of that away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One jumps off a cliff, they all jump off? Data, is it possibleto plant a command into the Borg collective consciousness? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay will find out what it means to be threatened. Computer, discontinue image of Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm familiar with the game. Go on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I could runit right now. I wouldn't have the same control that you have, but itwould still work. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Enjoy yourself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He'd better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you fromviolating a treaty the Federation signed in good faith. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it. Sovereign. Chef. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly's play. Ever since I began rehearsing for the role, I'vebeen uneasy and restless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer. There's a power reduction in section L-Ninety Four. Explain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is everybody all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's backtrack that course. See if there are any unusualreadings or anomalies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What a charming suggestion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields are down to three percent. We're diverting allavailable power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Powerful enough. We came to talk! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think we'll need to put in to a starbase? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Without them we would never mature into adults. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why are you still here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Locutus of Borg, this is Captain William T. Riker of the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us withmore information. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nelvana Three on screen. Still no sign of them on sensors. In away, I'd rather be fighting my way this, It's just too damned easy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do we know what she was doing when this happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Traveller's gone, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you think you were right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, if we're going to have further dealings with the Borg nowor in the future, I think that we should find out all we can about them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it having any effect? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. Any communication, Lieutenant Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wes, responsibility and authority go hand in hand. I know you'reresponsible, now we've got to teach you a little bit of authority. Oneof the reasons you've been given command is so you can make a few rightdecisions, that will establish a pattern of success and help buildself-confidence. If you don't trust your own judgment, you don't belongin the command chair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're absolutely right, Doctor. Right now, I can't imagine everhurting anybody. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doesn't it taste good? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but your outpost is in imminentdanger of attack. I would like to station security personnel on thesurface for your protection. Now, I'm ordering you to drop yourshields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And he was? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just enjoy the game. Don't let them change the dice on you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is it. Short-range craft, two twelve hundred fiftymillicochrane warp engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The women. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She needs the transporter to get the boy back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, urgent. We must have ship's power, <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This seems brutal even for the Ferengi. Any sign of survivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In a sudden, abrupt power surge to high warpspeed, Captain, we may be able to break loose from that Ferengiforcefield. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why the devil are we be going to this planet? Are there anyminers or indigenous life forms on the planet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not that easy. There are differences in the way that mypeople make love. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't enjoyed it, if that's what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do we do now, Captain? With them monitoring our every moveand every word. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. As soon as Data determined the microbrain's method ofoperation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Got it. The Artemis. Launched ninety twoyears ago. Destination Septimus Minor. When they failed to check in,Starfleet began an extensive search. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, I'll notify Starfleet. I'll let them know what'shappening. You have your orders. Dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you drop a hammer on your foot, it's hardly useful to get madat the hammer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well Mister Potts, why don't we start at the beginning? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, we'll see. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you here to work or to play, Mister Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's what I'm hoping you're going to find out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How is he, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have evidence that you're behind it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't have to do that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If the situation were different, I'd stay. But I can't. Notwhile he's aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently, Deanna being on board is only part of the reason. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Evasive manoeuvres, pattern Riker Alpha. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye-aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll need a little more time to make this decision. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your recommendation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Over here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That sounds like quite a project. How long will it take tofinish your studies on Kaldra? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, not by name, but the Federation. They know the Federationwill send their best. That'll give them a perfect chance to seefirsthand how far we've advanced both in technology and technique. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about me? Did you see one of those mouths on my head aswell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Luxurious is more like it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your Persian flaw. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll be on the Bridge. Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It might be wise to put some distance between us before weinitiate warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To tell the truth, sir, it sounds to me like nonsense to me. Butconsidering <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That'll be quite a juggling act. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to O'Brien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With a sixteen year gap in my head? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, we did. It's in one of our cargo holds. You act like it'smore important than your comrades. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope they're good feelings. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: DaiMon Tog, I thought the Krayton left orbit hours ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At least we can pull them out of orbit before they enter theatmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At least ten more minutes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields at maximum. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not now, Remmick. He's going to take this out, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They thought he was jeopardising the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Might be dangerous. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Was he a prisoner of war? Who did this to him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You honestly think Q is telling the truth? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Riker. Go ahead, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Music lessons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Radue, exactly why were we invited here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've a feeling somebody's going to be here to receive thosestorage tanks. I'd be very interested to know who that is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That doesn't give us much time, and it could get pretty rough inthere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will he survive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wes. Sit down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, prepare to extend shields. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's a pleasure to meet you, Manua. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, Lieutenant, we're here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was that which sent us back, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we can find them. We've arranged for quarters on the ship,if you'd like to stay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try narrowing the scan field. See if you can pick up anybiosigns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Either way, you can have it back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One final request, sir. Permission to beam a box of Data'sChinese finger puzzles over to the Ferengi. A thank you for all theytried to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maximum shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You are holding our captain. I want him released. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which leaves me back where I started. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Confirmed. The MS One colony is underattack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's a Klingon. That takes a little more explanation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Lin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Homeless? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me do it. I've had a lot of experience with this sort ofsystem failures. I might be able to do something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status report, Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. Enterprise out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It looks like we're going to have to head into to the ArgusArray. This is the third time this year it's stopped relaying data. Starfleet's beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. Iwant you to start a long range scan once we get. Lieutenant? Are youlistening to me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't know how long I've longed to tell you that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise. For how long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, we've had this conversation a hundred times. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You look doubtful, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In fairness? You disrupt this ship, you kidnap the Captain. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If this is a Romulan ship, will it stay in position until weleave? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fair enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we have to take the risk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. Return to the Enterprise, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ah, that's going to be a little difficult right at the moment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Superior? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set main viewer on that tangent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Half impulse, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to execute that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Detain the vessel and quarantine the pilot. Is he armed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sixteen years, you'd think I'd be able to hit that note. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One of us could beam into the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you worried that I won't be able to say no to it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then it really was lucky, wasn't it, that we were able to findhytritium when we did. And just enough hytritium for this crisis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But I did win. I was betting that you wouldn't call. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What has happened? What happened to Sickbay? To you? To me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think anyone's going to come to your defence this time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Min! Minuet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Drop your weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What I don't understand, sir, is how Karnasknew you were still available. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint forDoctor Quaice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very impressive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're going to take me whether I want to go or not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report. I don'tknow what you got away with at your last posting, but this is theEnterprise. We set a different standard here. Understood? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There she is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's in the case? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cloaking shields off. Obey my orders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we do it, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That was you, of course, Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man,bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand thatyour people needed peace to ensure their future. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. The Captain's hurt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it is a Romulan vessel, it could be cloaked. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're not here to pressure you, Doctor. We just want an updateon your progress. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. Let's consider evacuation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, analyse signal <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't feel bad. You passed everything else. Diplomatic law,first contact procedures, Bridge operations. The Engineeringqualification's one of the toughest parts of the test. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course you wouldn't. But Napoleonic equipment on an alienplanet. One so different it has twin moons? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have only seventeen minutes of warppower left. Do whatever you can to get them out of warp. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, you'd be asking one hundred andtwenty five people to die a meaningless death. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be very comfortable, thank you. Good night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate transformation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know, sir, I must report it to Starfleet. That's at least onefull day for subspace communications to reach there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, will you help me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry if she troubled you, sir. I have already informed her <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yuta, don't do this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's true. It sees with its sensors, it talks with itscommunications systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, wasn't the Captain looking forward tothis mission to the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But your files they say you're a <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency teams, stand by transporter rooms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Override them? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You just want me to prove that Data is a mere machine. I can'tdo that because I don't believe it. I happen to know better. So I'mneither qualified nor willing. You're going to have to find someoneelse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's heading for the planet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Granted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi did it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Spock? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or did we step from one Bridge onto another Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible. I was just thinking about an old-fashioned lemonade. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have always tried to keep an open mind, not to judge someone else's culture by my own, but for me to be a part of this ceremony. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we can't be certain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm reading forty seven of them around the perimeter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A sensor echo, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. Because there's nothing to be afraid of. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From where did the ionisation come? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonistson visual. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir. You'll be able toshape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet. You haven't decidedwhat you're going to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. We will have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But it'sa chance we have to take. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Inertial dampers at maximum. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just a sensor glitch? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, who leads when you dance? If you dance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ah is right, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, and Mickey D just walked out the door. How did he do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were there, all dressed in black. Very flattering on you,by the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ended it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, go ahead and depolarise the entire power grid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I must be. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're the chef? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, Data's out there right now, monitoring the conditions onDrema Four. The situation's become pretty desperate for hisfriend. He's calculated the safest location on the planet's surface. You can guess why. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher suggests we might design achip that would automatically retune the phasers to a random settingafter each discharge. Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for seventyfive years? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beam him back as what? He's nothing but energy now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Give us a superior curve, Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When in Rome, eh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You didn't say anything about a weapon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riva's not what I expected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything to report? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When we leave 'audet Nine, I'm going to need all the power youcan slam into those warp engines. LAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The number of troops under your admiral's command? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor Two, sir. See what'sout there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Problem, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. The mines are laid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I remember now. I was in an alley. They attacked me from behind. I tried to fight them off with the nisroh Worf gave me. I managed toget off one of them off me but I think they injected me with some sortof drug. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Rivas. Rivas Jakara. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not much power there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Potemkin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They would get even younger. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fajo was in the right place at the righttime just when we needed him most. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll set a course. I want this thing cleared up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I'll pass on that. I'd better check in. Enterprise, comein. Captain, do you read me? Let's. This may be nothing, but let's moveall our people together. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Deck eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've just picked up a distress call from aFerengi shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Full stop. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How will you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How the hell did they find themselves on a deserted planet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exactly. And since they equate intelligence with strength, theywon't pass up the chance to use that knowledge. Can you do it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course not, Mister Burke. That was Klingon guile. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Data, I gave you direct orders to get to NeutralZone immediately. Explain the delay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you make the adjustments on the visor by yourself? It'lllook suspicious if you're both working on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your daughter? Nice to meet you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is this Corvallen now? I'm under orders to acquire somemagnesite. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thoughtthat we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you haveall the time in the world, until. Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was Lore, sir. Same facial twitches that we've seen allalong. Lying unconscious on the floor exactly as Data had described. But then it suddenly became violent, apparently sensing that Wesley andI were present. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll take a shuttle in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What I need is to get out of this cell. I've been locked in herefor days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,and what to think, and what to say, and when I show a glimmer ofindependent thought you strap me down, you inject me with drugs. Youcall it a treatment. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh. I see. I'm sorry. I'll see you in the morning. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's my only answer. Now if there's some other way we can helpyou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you met our Commander Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transmitting what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Back? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not possible. I'm Will Riker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shouldn't we assume that he is alive until it's been provedotherwise? We cannot just abandon him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, transporter room three. Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Enterprise. Return our personnel or face immediatereprisal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Surely you don't want to remain here? How can you take care ofyourselves? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set the arc at six point three. I'll optimise the plasma flow. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who are you? Captain's log, supplemental. It is now six hourssince our away team beamed down to the planet surface. On theEnterprise, our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, withreserve power alone, we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding has closed down all engines and is draining ourreserve power too. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Leijten, Geordi, check out the shuttle. Data, Worf,you've got the perimeter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something wrong, Wes? Commander Kurn perhaps? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have a saboteur aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi, please have Rivareport to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well beam some of those ghosts back. One of them may be Geordi. Permission to lead another away team, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They've never come out this far before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher? Engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You got any ideas? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there someone in particular that you're talking about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But you have no place to go? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Lock phasers on the Romulans and hold your fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to launch the construction module. I'dlike to get this over with as fast as possible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Playing it safe? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. They stayed in the freighterRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you absolutely certain, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But her version puts a noose around my neck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, it's all right, Lieutenant. Those are the Edo we met before. They certainly are fit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: About one hundred metres apart. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With your permission? Mister Data, a stolen transport vessel hasdeparted from Lunar Five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If the timing is precise, it's possible to beam through and ontothe planet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I prefer the company of equals. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We lost Crusher. Itappears he rigged a site-to-site transport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'm familiar with most Earth codes, and <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare to activate gamma pulse generators. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could this have been a hoax? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where're you fellows off to? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps we should discuss this at your next evaluation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even with a treaty, they're still skittish about protectingtheir border. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd better get over with a team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Owon. For you, Data, something special. Don't be afraid. Theywon't bite you. And for you, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But why? Unless there's something they want us somethingthey need us to see. Wait a minute. Data, the containment fieldstrength is down to eighteen percent. Can you stabilise it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, give us a visual. Magnification factorfifty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and thesoul in my night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starfleet can't make its move until we'reout of the Demilitarised Zone. We're to break formation and take coverin the Nebula as soon as they appear. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did you? Where did you come from? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I knew I could count on my Imzadi, the ship's Counsellor toboost my self-image. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Calm down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Load all torpedo bays. Stand by phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's over two sectors away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He will have the protection of the Seldonis Convention. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. It's kind of you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Direct hit on their main reactor. They're returning fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A charity hospital near the waterfront. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Circa 1958. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And are you saying that this belief will eventually become areligion? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is Riker. We've got a problem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I can save Captain Picard, I consider that very acceptable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would be ideal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Suppose we turn their impatience and greed against them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you picking anything up, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what are they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What have you done to him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you sure? You've always said it's a chess game with theRomulans. Move, counter move, guile and deceit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know the Captain's orders, Lieutenant. Engage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we are in the war zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I understand, sir. As soon as my people have made certain she'ssafe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That must cover a lot of ground. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We had no effect on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was doing some repairs under the station when an earthquakehit. I got caught in a rockslide. I had to set it myself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're sure spending a lot of time over there. I wonder if theyLAFORGE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The preparation for the mission, the play, those were recentexperiences, fresh in my mind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But I guess I'll have to get used to it if I want to get mycareer going again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't believe how stupid I was. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A cloaking device of some sort, to hide the entire base? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I have a request, sir. I would like to conduct an investigationinto Captain Picard's death. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's she doing on that ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase eightyseven, warp five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's it doing? Checking us out? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For all we know, you and I could hate each other. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Re-establish. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What have you got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: After what she did for us down there, that doesn't surprise meone bit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, extend shields! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Except for one thing. It hardly sounds like Q to give us anadvantage like that. Unless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They either don't see us, or don't see us as a threat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope it's enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How was it, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We may surprise you in a lot of ways. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something I can help you with, Mister Remmick? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think, I don't remember. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's hard to play from in here. I can't even see the wholeboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lay in a new course to Dulisian Four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think my horsemanship is a little rusty for the Himalayas. Thanks anyway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you give us any more, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suppose the warp coil. Before there was warp drive, humanswere confined to a single sector of the galaxy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All I know is when I go back to the ship, reality breaks apart. Nothing makes sense. And then when it's over, it fades away like adream. But when I'm in the hospital, everything here seems real and Iremember everything that happens here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You, an expert in humanity? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep it down, Geordi, for as long as you can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The distress call came in only four days ago. Why would DoctorRozhenko have waited so long before sending it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's see, where were we? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're not going to wait around. Let's find the rest of our team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They won't get the chance. We'll use the transporter in thatshuttle. We'll beam directly to the Observation lounge. Sorry aboutthis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Electromagnetic field? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fencing? I'm really not very good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, transfer complete. We are ready to leave orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The course to the Fleming is plotted and laid in, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ten. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will check in on you later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are yourparents now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. This one'sgetting away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Non-stop. I have to admit it has a certain strange fascination. How long can two people talk about nothing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, any other ships in the vicinity of Dulisian Four? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, we're in position. Your status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the first bad play I've seen you make. If you can bringhappiness into Deanna's life, nothing would please me more. You know,you're really not such a bad sort, Ral, except you don't have anyvalues, beyond the value of today's bid, that is. Deanna is just thewoman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence, if you're smartenough to take it. I doubt that you are. To the last mile. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which is? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything on long range sensors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't they seem a little slow? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And what about the men? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't leave Geordi behind. I want the Pakleds on that screenand I want them now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. RO JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's seal off this entrance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we should take the Doctor's advice. Take this veryslowly until we've all adjusted, and then we'll talk to the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In what way? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. Captain, do you read me? Can wecompensate? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Carmen, have you got construction started I didn't know about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should all get together. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I busted a rib. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, we're going to have to depend on each other if we're goingto get through this, okay? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This ought to be easy for someone written up in bio-mechanicaltexts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander La Forge, Commander Leijten, report to theBridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wasn't a hero and neither were you. What you did was wrong andI was wrong to support you, but I was just too young and too stupid torealise it. You were the captain. I was the ensign. I was justfollowing orders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now an audience. Whoa. Too many. I was thinking of something alittle more intimate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge. Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure beforeyou make them? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thirteen sixty five baker. That should putus right behind shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, initiate the quarantine transmitters on the Lantreeand activate her marker beacons. We'll need to find her again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We invite your petition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Happened even more quickly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Think about it, Mister Potts. And while you're at it, thinkabout what may have happened had we not been this close to a starbasemedical facility. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He took the bait. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. I'm actually here to tell you that I've decided to cancelthe rest of your test. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, you act as if there's a connection between the timedistortion and the distress signal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Youheard me. A collision course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Bartel, divert all power from auxiliary relay systemsto the manoeuvring thrusters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated into the hivewithout any questions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On the way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien says the weapon was in a state of discharge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. I kept hoping it wouldn't be here. That it had beendestroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, go with him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, we could use a hand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: While these things are being checked, permission to leave theBridge, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm certain the Ferengi are behind the faked log. No wonderthey're waiting out there. Headache back, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you correct for it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Recognise those markings, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Speaking of Klingons <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But it's what you've always wanted, Data, to become human. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's in there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Apgar. If you're prepared to getstarted, so are we. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The calm before the storm? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These are the more palatable choices. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, your ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Triplets? Worf, there is something damn odd down here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It doesn't look like any blast point I've ever seen. The shapeis too perfect. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, why don't you take a look at the doctor'sexperimental data. Later, you can give me an overview. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were studying the ruins. It was a scientific expedition. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Problem, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Primitive? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. All of them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And it is designed to travel at warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I hope so, for their sake. ) <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We found your on the bulkheads and the console. We know youwere there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beat. You wouldn't believe the dreams I was having. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have a better idea, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll be right back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why this place? Why Vandor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, we've got one, waiting to beam aboard complete withorders. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate that you're carrying magnesite ore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's only one reason he chose cargo bay four. If it becomesnecessary, Ensign, you will blow the cargo bay hatch on my orders. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think they mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. You have my coordinates, La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why don't you join us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll be coming into orbit of Vulcan in lessthan an hour, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you make of it, La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could launch a probe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That array has such a narrow scan field. We might as well breakout the palm beacons and try to find them that way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will they still be able to dissipate the wave? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're coming through clearly now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shuttlebay two, open hangar door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sensors have picked up another E-band emission. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. How's it coming? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And to complete our business here, we are locked onto you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wonder why they don't react to us, or why the Enterprisedidn't read any life signs, especially with this many of them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: ETA? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hardly the response we expected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A whopping big one, and you know it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there some reason we shouldn't be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're holding position in the Argaya System. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last surviving senior officer. He will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff inEngineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was set to level ten. Standard procedure requires that allphasers are set on level one when they're in storage. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This could be a prelude to an invasion. But who's behind it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The rules on this ship do not change just because Ro Larendecides they do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Slow to one third impulse power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, it's time to set a course for Parliament. Warpeight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you contact Doctor Selar when yousaw that he was beginning to go? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There is no delta shift yet, sir. I have spoken to thedepartment heads about changing from three shifts to four, and theyassure me it's going to cause us significant personnel problems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, one more time. The ramistat kiloquadcapacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio timesthe sum of the plasma injector quotient. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc. Two to transport. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 <bos> RIKER: Whatever it was it seems something Data doesn't want to tell usabout. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will not break any vow I have taken in the past. I have alsotaken an oath a loyalty to your ship. I will not break that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alone, Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I escort you, Miss Troi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, you and Miss Henshaw have been seeing a lot of each other. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks to reachthem at impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you know that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Them? Who's them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I almost cost you your life! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I don't think there's any record of an Earth colony inthat area. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let me take her with me. She can go back to the Enterprise. Wewould give her asylum. You would never have to see her again. Thatwould solve the problem, wouldn't it? You'd be rid of her. She wouldnever be able to influence anyone again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you say the discontinuities started to occur afteryou returned from a Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge. They steal technology. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. We're a rescue party. We picked up your colony's distresscall and we came as fast as we could. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know what it is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's far enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Some form of tai chi chuan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's ordered us to withdraw? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Lieutenant La Forge. Prepare a technical support awayteam. Meet me in transporter room three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's just a toy. I was taking home as a present. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thanks. Another time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're here to establish a dialogue, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I had cosmetic surgery to correct a genetic birth defect. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My condolences. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll need to dump the entire engine core. Do you have anauto-eject system? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what was Geordi repairing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just this. I'm not a murderer. I went to the Tanugan lab as anofficial representative of Starfleet. I actedaccordingly. I was there to evaluate Doctor Apgar's progress in thedevelopment of a Krieger Wave converter. That's all I was interestedin. Computer. Load deposition programme Riker one. Run the simulation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How could you get an empathic impression from an empty room? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is that what those are? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet asit did. It gives us some time to consider our options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled thewarp drive at approximately the same time? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starship Ferengi, this is Commander Rikerhere. I'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a run of the mill happening, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have enough information at this point <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Can we get to Engineering? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They appear to be in pretty good condition. According to oursensors their shields back to full strength. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: About everything that's going on. I'm sorry. I'm sure it willall work out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You must be in heaven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Use your sleeve. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To which one? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. They'll be pleased that. Can you explain now what hewas after? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've traced the problem to the power transfer beam. There'ssome sort of feedback coming from one of the colony's weathersubstations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, I think our guest is going to have a lot of engineeringquestions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Halt. I know this perfect little vacation spot. In fact, itfalls within the coordinates of this sector. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No you can't. Don't even try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi is trying to stabilise the unit now. Wewill stay as long as possible. There are thousands of people in thearea. If that reactor goes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All hands, this is Commander Riker. We are about to engageimpulse engines for a short burst. Inertial dampers are on manual. Theymay not fully compensate for acceleration. So brace yourselves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do the best you can, Data. Let's just hope we can get thesection we need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Armaments, Lieutenant Yar? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As the First Officer on this ship, I have to set an example. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coolant leak! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but we need our Chief Engineer back on board our ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had a change of profession. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beam over. We'll show you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander La Forge to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's infected with <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get offthis ship. Are there any others survivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I won't let him blow this ship into space. If I can set up a lowlevel comm. link between the two ships, I can use my personal commandcodes. I can deactivate the shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Time? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go to backup systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then try something else. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's what happened to the Vico. They didn't see anythingcoming until it was too late. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Help me! Help me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which brings up a very serious possibility. What if there's anoutside influence at work here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From the sound of it there's not that much difference betweenour species. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you think that Rocha was killed by one of these organisms? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever's pulling us sure isn't in a hurry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess it's been a while since you've had to punch a clock. Let's go. Energise. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There was a moment when you smiled. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If it was Outpost twenty three you were after, why didn't youuse your neural scanners to probe my mind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't want to hear that, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, Mister Worf, get a security team on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Prepare for umbilical disconnect. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Assume a high orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll keep you so busy you won't have a chance to. I've got toget going. I have to get back to cargo bay two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're leaving the ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet, exactly as Iwould for any woman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The simulation begins in one hour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've already got all the players you need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it a wild theory, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll all be dead anyway. Just need a few more seconds. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen, Night Bird. One, two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage cloak. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And when the engineer tried to protect us, one of the charactersshot him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Troi, since this obviously significant to you, I'll I'll carry it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Still sounds better than pea soup. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Every single time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tension is hardly the word I'd use. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right on schedule. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's more than just a cloak. It changes the structure of matter. In theory, a ship using this device could pass through normal matter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The only place we're going back to, sir, is bed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You are endangering this ship for no reason. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They were just playing dead. Conserving power until we got inclose enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I'll have to go down there alone, undercover. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That star's going to go any minute, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have a problem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All those years. That's why I never won. You were cheating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unless he's borrowing one. If he's hanging over the planet'spole, the magnetic field would confuse our sensors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll look over the schematics and I'll draw up a mission plan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engage, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you have any idea who was behind the attack? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My mother died when I was a baby. All I have is pictures, andthe stories that my father used to tell me about her. I begged him totell those stories over and over. When I was five and I went to school,I started to tell my new friends those same stories, pretending thatshe was alive. Then I started believing that she was alive, that she'djust gone away, that she was coming back. The teacher got wind of this,and she and my father had this talk with me. They told me it wasimportant to accept the fact that my mother was dead and that shewasn't coming back. And all the hoping in the world wouldn't make itso. In my mind, that was the day that my mother actually died. I criedall that night. But after that, it started feeling better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well it doesn't matter. Once Picard makes his decision, doesanyone question it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Open a channel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer wasdamaged? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I take it the Sheliak just hung up on us again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm just not right for this part. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd like to discuss this with the Captain. Take Ishara down tosee Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Put it on screen. Scan for magnesite in its hold. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kevin and Rishon? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We believe everything in the universe has a right to exist. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what happened to the Captain and Doctor Crusher? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something wrong with that one? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. Be prepared to take command. Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is a violation of protocol. Crewmembers should not besimulated in the holodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying you think there are people living in there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna needs your help. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Position security teams at both entrances. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's assuming an attack posture. Don't be surprised if <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, any update on the Vulcan ships? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll stay here. PICARD <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With an offer of amnesty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computerhas been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world toour computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It depends how they get along. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. We have to assume that they've been trading theirsurplus energy for the construction materials used here. According toour ship's scans, many of the materials used are not found on thisworld. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's phased completely out of existence. At least, out of ourexistence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't have that kind of time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: More than anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With the saucer gone, I assume somethinginteresting happened on your way here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll need your advice and recommendations. As you know, I'vebeen given the responsibility of overseeing Wesley's education. Tofurther that goal, I would like to put him in charge of the planetarymineral surveys. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've got company. I'm ready to pull you out ofthere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've never been very good at organising my time off. Something'll turn up. It always does. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's just that our mental pathways have become accustomed toyour sensory input patterns. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, arm phasers and photon torpedoes. Prepare to fire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're still at the altered heading, Captain, holding at warpnine point three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Soren. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It still hurts. It's bleeding again. Why? You just healed it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He'd never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They'll be back. As I said, I figured you wouldn't take no foranswer. But I thought you had more sense than to send adefenceless ship across the border into hostile territory with noescort. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. BA'EL <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. We just bought this place, lock, stock, andbarrel. Consider it a done deal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have a limited, two-second warp capability. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wonder, Captain. I'm not usually one for distrust at firstsight, but this may be an exception. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Run a maintenance sweep. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For as long as she lasts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transporter room five. I'm still a littleuncomfortable with your leading this away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Commander is a physical representation of a dream, an ideaconceived of by the mind of a man. It'spurpose is to serve human needs and interests. It's a collection ofneural nets and heuristic algorithms. Its responses dictated by anelaborate software programme written by a man. Its hardware built by aman. And now. And now a man will shut it off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not going to try to save her yourself, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is our Transporter Chief, Mister O'Brien. Shall we? Captain's Log, supplemental. We have enteredCardassian territory, and are proceeding on our quest to locate thePhoenix. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It was headed for an asteroid belt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's all? Riker to Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're just too damned efficient, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where did these nodes come from? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The ship is at risk as long as we're sitting here. We couldcontinue the investigation outside the nebula. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there any danger to the ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The repairs are almost complete. I wishthere was something more we could do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A cook's only as good as his ingredients. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong? I asked a question. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where would you say we are now, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's hope that's enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the latest on the Enterprise'smedical situation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, project his new course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Firing second burst. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, release command control this station. Authorisation,Riker Omega three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax theembouchure. Don't use any muscles you don't need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry, you heard the Captain. Duty calls. I guess we'll have todo this some other time. Captain's log, stardate 46307.2. We have just comeinto orbit of Tyrus Seven A to monitor progress on the Tyran particlefountain, a radically new mining technology. So far the project hasbeen fraught with problems, and is well behind schedule. Mister LaForge has been assigned to evaluate the situation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It would still get us. It would just take a little longer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's heading toward Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Romulan! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it trying to communicate? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool forhistorians? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There will be a meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteenhundred hours to draw up a mission plan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just want to see your face, that's all. So we can talk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's an excuse. What you really mean is it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife. Watch you stab it into your heart, then pull the knife from your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve. That's the rite of death, isn't it? Well, I'm sorry, Mister Worf. I can't help you. There's only one person on this ship who can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said you knew she was an android. How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and thesoul in my night. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All he's got left are his manoeuvring jets,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know if they'll let me do that, Jean-Luc, but I willask. JR <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do you know, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. And in that discussion, I <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we find the source? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their range of influence appears to beconcentrated in the Medical Lab, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've had enough of this. I want you to take a message back toyour people. You tell them the Federation is willing to negotiate forthe release of Doctor Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Run a diagnostic immediately. Try bypassingthe <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're all delusions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Jarada will expect the Captain'sgreeting. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you put us on the bridge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: First, molecular biology. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He is engaged in other duties, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can anyone else over there do it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Seems after hailing him for three days, he could've found aminute to talk to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is the source of the probe? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've also ordered a standing Yellow Alert. All Federation and allied outposts have been warned. Ops will continueto monitor long range sensors. I've assigned Data, La Forge and MisterCrusher to work with Commander Shelby. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I see. May I ask how long? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready to beam out. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have your instructions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I want to talk aboutthe assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you getting any life signs? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. You're my friend. I thought, I don't know, I thought Ishould tell you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I could beam into the turbolift, force the doors, take them bysurprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yankee traders. I like the sound of that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. Say, I was wondering if you could tell me <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look who's here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did Starfleet mention any Klingon ships in this sector? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It would be my pleasure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We spent some time together. Not very well. How well did youknow her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Engineering, holding at station keeping,range six hundred and forty metres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've downloaded the Lantree's log, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And then Lore came along. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which was? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I'd like a security detail to accompany the awayteam to the surface. I'll lead the team. Geordi, you're with me. MisterData, you have the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We should have an engine core ready for them by nineteen hundredhours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Left hand. Right hand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nope. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which, leaves us with only one conclusion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain, I have a report for you,sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is he now? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How close are we on that transporter? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tog must have missed that chapter in the Ferengi book ofEtiquette. Enterprise? Must be too far out ofrange. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: At ease, Lieutenant! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, set a course to Galorndon Core. Take us to warp eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. It must be someone from either alien delegation. Now, ifthe Ferengi could have bought or bribed even one of them, that's allthat they'd need. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This room, it's more than a holodeck, isn't it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got thirty percent power. It won't be enough to stop us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think it's time we talked to the Captain about Broccoli. That's what Wesley calls him. Keep it to yourself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Was that the orange one with the lumpy skin? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't want to leave without sayinggoodbye. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Communications as long as conditions permit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maintain shields at full intensity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The difference in ages between you and Davies is not the issuehere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, he stays. Because I've been given unusual powers, Iam not suddenly a monster. Except for these abilities, and I don't yetknow how far they go, I'm the same William T. Riker you've alwaysknown. Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. Admiral. I am in no condition to negotiate with theRomulans or with anyone else. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Had a small run-in with an aspiring sprinter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could we blow it into pieces? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And less enjoyable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the Bortas is Gowron's ship. If he's the legitimateleader of the Empire, shouldn't we help him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then it was constructed by someone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm notconvinced about Lavelle. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fourteen hundred hours. Mister O'Brien, no maintenance on thetransporters until further notice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Here's your twenty. Three hundred more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight fornothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And if your theory fails to pay off? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've also seen it in what I can do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particlesin the star. There's nothing left to take out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which you'll beam over next to the entityLORE <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could you join us on the Bridge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: These mission details could have been transmitted. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. Make sure you take all this junk with you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. It's been a difficult couple of days. I know that oneof your operatives has been on a mercenary ship investigating thepossible re-assembly of a psionic resonator. I didn't want someone tomake a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aboard the Stargazer, sir. The sphere you destroyed, it'sbeen controlling your <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd appreciate it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. All hands, battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That would leave us without warp power for more than a week. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nuria. Exceptionally clear-minded, sensible. The Mintakans trusther judgment. If we can convince her that you are not a god <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have no other choice. We have to try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proud warrior Worf, without a single tie to his own kind. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests toquarters. Not too close to mine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is this all about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you fell in love? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They may not be able to withstand another hit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're going to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all. Hail Minister Lorin, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I speak with you in private? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your engines have engaged, haven't they, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign, our position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't believe you're willing to sacrifice Captain Picard'slife as a negotiating tactic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when you're ready. Ensign, takeus to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not yet. Geordi thinks that'll be ready by oh eight hundredhours tomorrow. But before that, we should see if we can balance thisengine. Can you access the starboard manifold thrust? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He could be hurt. Maybe he can't respond. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you located the escape pod's landing point, Chief? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we know how they think, shouldn't we be able to get somethingacross to them? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. Unless. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In the meantime? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who was that? You just missed him. Is there a new Lieutenant onboard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you,either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to controleverything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, andyou don't inspire these people to go out of their way for you. You'veget everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don'tthink you're a particularly good Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation StarshipEnterprise. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Helm, prepare for warp three. Heading two hundred andninety four mark thirty seven. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: One thousand fourteen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why don't I talk to Commander La Forge in Engineering and we'llsee what we can do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Medical emergency. Deck seventeen, section three alpha. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is something important supposed to be happening here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I. Yes. I don't know <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange to have him transported on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take them back to the ship, analyze them there. Mister Barclay. Glad you could join us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, they're going to be here any minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Killing lab lights now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I won't let them hurt you. You'll be safe on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's find another way out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was atthe Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Generators? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster thanexpected. He was pleased that I'd noticed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna. I know it's been a long time since we've beentogether, and I know your feelings have changed. Mine haven't. I can'tjust give up. I'd like to be with you again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A short circuit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need to talk to you about the phaser test results. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did you find them all, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who used the beacon? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unusual in what way? Specify? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain's team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good idea. If you would accompany the Counsellor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Should you be beaming down there alone, unarmed? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And more over here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you're convinced it is the Borg? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Yar is calling from Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing byto beam Ligonian welcoming party aboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields up! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's get the hell out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The transporter trace? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough tohandle all that information. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How will you get them across the border? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Having fun, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Origin? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise now taking possession ofStargazer, Kazago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For both of you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why's that? Not that I disagree. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well let me put it another way. Will he survive long enough totell us what he was doing here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any passages leading to the surface? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the source? Something underground? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: By whom? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So that's why the ship's instruments have become so erratic. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suppose it depends on how people perceive time. Everysituation is different. It depends on how you feel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were unexpectedly delayed at Omicron Pascal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It'll be dark there in thirty minutes. We've scheduled an awayteam for dawn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And a marshal outranks even an Admiral Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it's far more likely that I am a weather balloon than analien. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive and take ourchances. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is not commonly known that during those negotiations, you,Kalin Trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your moon who wasattempting to assassinate the Beta delegate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's it! I can see that diplomacy is not going to get usanywhere today, and I do not have time for to negotiate. So let's putall of our cards on the table. You're concerned the Kes are going to beadmitted to the Federation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it seems reasonable put that way. But I warn you, if youget hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, hard to starboard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about the computer systems? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You haven't heard my offer. Half a gram of Anjoran biomimeticgel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right. What should I choose? Computer, I'd like some placeto play some music. A little atmosphere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Daren. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increasing power to the shields. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How are the others? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly thinks Alkar must have been at asusceptible point in the meditation ceremony. He was vulnerable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get a tractor beam on her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is something you're going to have to decide for yourself,Ishara. Think about it while we're waiting for Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said he made a pass at you, but youfailed to mention whether he was successful or not. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We came here to help these people. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right here. That was close. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've got you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're on pad two. I've set a ten second delay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Right. That still hurts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the probe is through the airlockand in position aboard the Raman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't both be telling the truth. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting we use your own body? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, itseems they're carefully avoiding hitting the station. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, I sort of like it. I guess I'd better get going. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Power transfer appears stable at this end, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's very kind, Ambassador. But I don't think anyone hereholds you or the Kes government responsible for what's happened. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nicely done. I hope we know what we're doing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, you and I will try to get there. Mister Worf, this room isgoing to fill with wounded in a few minutes and they're going to needhelp. I want you to stay in charge here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Suggesting? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? How terrible for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why her? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Remmick has left the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we should assume the worst, that everyone on the Bridgeis dead. There'sno one is in control of the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did who say? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell them, tell them we haven't finished yet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Certainly that can wait until we've recovered the survivors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana, don't. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something, anything to can cut through thestorm. Some way to get a signal through to him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now do you see why it's funny? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'll let me beam them? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Glad you feel better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid that was me, Worf. I was checking to see if thephasers still operate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. He's on foot, couldn't have gotten too far. Let'sassume a radius of ten kilometres. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As in Tam Elbrun of the Ghorusda disaster? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What could he want? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll manage. Right now, they're more important. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you need more time to study it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No idea. No one's filed a flight plan. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we are approaching Science Station Delta ZeroFive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You want to clone us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All sections ready to begin the survey, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We went through some serious times. Do you really think we'regoing to find the Pegasus again? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Possibly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is it, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Someone has to confront him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll see. Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Rager, cartography needs a betterposition to study cluster thirteen. Bring us about, heading onetwenty three mark four. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Computer, lights up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Seventy three, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You enjoyed that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying that Worf's quantum signature is different fromours? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Certainly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an empath. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm willing to take that risk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A total surprise. Apparently a member of one of the factionsdidn't like the idea of peace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander, I bring all the alternatives to the Captain'sattention. That'll be all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, the Black Cluster is distorting the sensors. We'repicking up echoes of the Enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Seasoned. That's a horrible thing to say to a man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Raise the shields. Where are the Klingons? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, but, it's still moving. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think I'd better get a little rest. Clear my mind a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've worked hard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our efforts with the Prytt just ran into a wall. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You pull as many people off the surface asyou can and get back to the transwarp conduit. The Captain's orderswere to get the Enterprise back to Federation space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've gotten word from the monitoring stations. They're allonline. We're ready when you are, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what's the point? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously made by Colonel Richey. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I will not help a friend commit suicide. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That is the firomactal drive unit. It controls the ramistat coreand also keeps the ontarian manifold at forty thousand KRGs. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you alright, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, put us in high equatorial orbit. Scan for survivors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, we've rendezvoused with the Merrimack. Please report to transporter room two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red Alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So what is it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So the Sheliak weren't hallucinating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Resume. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Later. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you think? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You said that when I was able to accept what I'd done and Iunderstood the consequences of my actions, that I would be free to go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She's really been stripped down, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Careful, the next rock is loose! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Settle in. I'll meet you on the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's he doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions fromthe null pocket and shut it down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Kelso. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: After Doctor Crusher declares you medically fit, you will beconfined to your quarters until a court martial can be convened. Findsome civilian clothes. I don't want to see you in that uniform. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor Tainer, we'll meet you intransporter room two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As a matter of fact, it was Baran who sent me here. He told meto pretend to be friendly with you and help you organise a mutiny, sohe can determine who your supporters in the crew and then eliminatethem. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge? Initiate stabilisation procedure! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are we doing back here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we gotcomfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're growing. Something about us compels us to learn, explore. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or be cloaked again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Perhaps we should to pay a visit to the Tripoli. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage report? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The cloak appears to be functioning normally. The ship'smatter-energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through theasteroid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to know how. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How'd this happen? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I happen to be a good pilot, too. And I know my way around theStarfleet shuttle. So what if we team up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not your commander. My name is William. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fascinating woman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, Data's going down to join you down there. Be my guest. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But if we could get further away, increase the deflector'srange. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Celtris Three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently it was riding a Lagrange point, hiding behind RanaFour's furthest moon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No! Damn it! Damn it to hell! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Pleased to meet you, ma'am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The place is called Risa, and believe me, Captain, it is aparadise. Warm tropical breezes, exotic food. Nothing to do but sitaround all day and enjoy the quiet. And then + <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is going on? Are you expecting someone? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to go to warp power. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't maintain power. We don't have the time. Prepare tofire. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dimensions, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Borg could have downloaded the codes from Data's positronicnet. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go to yellow alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No wonder they didn't answer our hail for two days. Nothing hereto answer with. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's true. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, it made an impact alright. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why a shuttlecraft? Why wouldn't he just beam over? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks like you've got a control logic lockout in your regulatorsubsystem. I'm going to attempt to run an activebypass through the plasma flow convertor. You, start runningphase-lock feedback through that regulator. I want about a six seconddelay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For all we know, reversing course may be what leads us into thecrash. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Oh, yeah? Well he wasn't the only one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We just ran a full test of those systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay. I thought it would be fatal if you left theholodeck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long will it take you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stargazer, Captain, respond! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best. 1 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We considered it. We knew it was a possibility. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's the myth. Somehow, as the legend goes, the Aldeans wereable to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders, andother hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This should be interesting. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're not alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you don't, you force me to take command of this vessel. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is this a test also? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There were only the two of us. I never knew my mother. She diedwhen I was very young. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Klingons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence fromthe Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now, I know for a fact that you never attended that tournamentand that no shuttlecraft has left the Enterprise for over a month. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Better than prison? There are officers who wait years to serveon this ship. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But we can hardly hate what we once were. They may grow andlearn. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No. It's just it's been a long time. Captain Jean-Luc Picard,Admiral Erik Pressman. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, okay. Can you do it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You have your orders, Lieutenant. Carry them out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. We are approaching Indri Eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What would cause something like this? Because it started at thesame time we encountered the anomaly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Preflight underway. Counting to clearance. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long have you known that you were like this? <eos>

 <bos> RIKER: How specific? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you trying to fill another inside straight, Worf? Don't sayI didn't warn you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If that is Uhnari, where's Rocha? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He was the most one in the group. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He's never late. Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locateLieutenant Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How's it going? ZERO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make that six to transport. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Resume one third impulse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Horatio? Isn't that Walker Keel's ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, you're not. You've been working for six hours straight. You're tired. Take a break. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That may explain some of the familiar feelings we have. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard to the Bridge, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't miss it for the world. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There must be a missing link here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Paul Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, he but carriesit well because he's usually right. He's a risk taker. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodationStarfleet has to offer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm still not comfortable leaving you here alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Aft station, Lieutenant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A seven, and a six, and the ace. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It would take a powerful weapon to do that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I agree. We're at war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields are at forty percent. We can manoeuvre on impulse, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'm sorry to disturb you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very well. Our Chief Engineer will beam over to help you. Close. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Dad. You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attaché? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Troi, I don't know how to tell you this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Temporal disturbance? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He calls that a little adventure? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Destroy it! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So much for that idea. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually it was quite a bargain, Kazago. I thought the Ferengialways made a profit on things. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not that far gone, am I? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, please report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will. The replicators on the station haven't worked for along time ago. It's been a while since I've had a decent meal. Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, Ambassador, I think I should try tocommunicate with the Prytt before I sanction the use of force. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What can you tell us about this device? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is everyone all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Admiral? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant La Forge says we will be able to engage the warpdrive within the hour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker here, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And your father? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I heard you, Lieutenant. I rejected your plan. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A shield? What kind? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That can't be right. We were told the Array stopped relayingdata six days ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But this won't be boring. If Q is anything, he's imaginative. Apparently our Captain wasn't meant to be with us here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're on board because of him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Especially since two new exobiologists and three stellarcartographers have joined us from the Zhukov. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke themin others. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire when ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi's up to speed. I trust his instincts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? At Nelvana three, he threatened to take thehull of the Enterprise home as a war trophy. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need that communicator. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Frozen? How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The exercise is over! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And of course your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry isunmatched. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge, you've got ten minutes. Mister Worf, Red alert. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your file says that you're an <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's called a Horga'hn. I don't think you'll have any troublefinding one. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, Data, would you be all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It won't last long in that radiation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think the Captain understands that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's too great a risk. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're all very proud of her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hachidan kiritsu! It's illegal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This first encounter, coming so suddenly after all this time. Wehave to assume it's a setup. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can't just leave her there. They'll giveher these psychotectic treatments. I don't know what to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everybody here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Transporter Chief. Do we have ourpeople on sensors yet? CHIEF <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They appear to be in some kind of stasis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, stay sharp. We may have to get out of there in ahurry. Set phasers on stun. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That means it doesn't have much range. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain approves. You're with us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know how or why, sir, but warp powerappears to be back to normal levels. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To the right? Fine, let's do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This isn't the Bridge. Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is ridiculous. A cell, a single cell. Let's check herquarters. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, isn't that something? My father's were the same way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Including the Neutral Zone border. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Lenarians attacked us outside of the conference room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What else do we know about Barradas Three? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. I felt trapped by the console. But it wasn't like this. There was something else here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: From the size and shape of the wreckage, it appeared to be somekind of escape pod. Their control system was badly damaged, which isprobably what caused the crash. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extractit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Disintegrated? How? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On my way, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we're too late. The sisters have already been here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. For two days I've been trying to construct sentenceswithout personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? It? To us,that's rude. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bad news? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you approvedRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead man. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With pleasure, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And it weakened him, in some way leading to the incredible leapout here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Save us some deep powder. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What have you got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stay right where you are. Drop your weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know that. I believe we were with Lieutenant Fratis i nmolecular biology. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's been a long day. We've all been through a lot. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nobody knows the transporters better than O'Brien and La Forge. They tell me they've managed more than a little sleight of hand withour authorisation codes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is she still underway? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What would be the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly,or allow them time to prepare for it thoroughly? Well, twenty minutes? Nice round figure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Take the engines offline. Supplement with auxiliary power only. All decks go to emergency level seven. Life support and criticaloperations only. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I ask why, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain. Captain, if he's not open to evidence in ourfavour, where will you go from there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I'll check them tomorrow. I'm going to bed early. Theperformance is tomorrow night. I want to be up for it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley, I've assigned you the command of the planetary mineralsurveys. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shut up! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. I want it inshuttlebay two for examination. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're establishing the link right now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Actually, I was thinking more about Ensign Ro. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You look a little sore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start? Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours. I'm having trouble waking up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There was no direct contact with the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We won't go back. You don't know what it's likein our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We'reone of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Incredible. You cheated me. How'd you get away with it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To join us as what? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you'll find it's a fascinating talethat we've come across here, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I like to think that I've lightened up a little in my old age. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you fix it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Look out! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what were you doing there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lied, conveniently forgot, I'm not sure. I think it's somethingwe have to consider. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What, no seconds? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was there, in Ward forty seven, just like in the play. Everyone thought that I was insane, that I'd actually killed someone. But it was all real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep notes. This project might turn out to be of interest toscholars in the future. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell was that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, now. Right away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That knot won't hold. If I may? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In the Marta community on the southern continent. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, there's a very sick little boy onboard theEnterprise who's not getting any better. We're dead in the water untilyou get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set a course, Ensign. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You need a knot that'll tighten under pressure. Let me show you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Coast? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry to interrupt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. You're talking about killing Deanna! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're no match for the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I haven't. I am simply trying to help you understand. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who reported to the Bridge from this group? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You can depend on it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What are you saying? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought I might. Would you like to join me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, I'm sure I will. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They will not go to war. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, if you're right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Looks as if someone could have just dropped them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That sounds like good news. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Did Manheim give you enough information todecipher the security code? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nothing. Nothing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? What is he doing it for then? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf! Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lore had been disassembled. He explained it as jealousy from thecolonists. And Data wasn't yet alive at that time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we lose containment, we should beprepared to separate. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Such as what you meant by a very profitable mission. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Three days? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then why, in all of our history, is there no record of you orsomeone like you ever having visited us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then do so. Lieutenant Yar was confused. We no longer enslaveanimals for food purposes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is urgent. Come in, please. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, get these men back to the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is it big enough to cause a threat? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're still fascinated with the human past? Perhaps you're notthat original. Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, tell transporterroom two to stand by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend some timeconsidering the Tarellian situation <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assumingthat responsibility must by definition include the safety of thecaptain. I have no problem with following any rules you lay down, shortof compromising your safety. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It usually refers to one's own memories, Captain. Do thememories you were given include farms, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's allthis? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's for a neighbour's child. Was there anything else found? Ihad one piece of jewelry, a metal pin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My head hurts. Somebody hit me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Advise Doctor Crusher we have a medicalemergency. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been on a lot of missions, seen a lotof people injured, but I've never been affected by anything like this. He was looking right at me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Transfers are to be approved by me before any offers are made. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, something's got me! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kansas City. No, wait. New Orleans. Bourbon Street Bar, NewOrleans. Around two a. m. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what's the best way to go aboutfinding Ramsey and the other survivors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit justbecause I'm unbeatable? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Don't be frightened. There is no way I could harm any of you. Shall I guess your dreams? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If this timetable is correct, we could get an indication ofsomething very soon. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What happened there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So the Federation sensors that monitor the Neutral Zone justmissed it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You were never too hurt for anything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is your problem? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wouldn't that bring about chaos? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tilonus Four? Didn't their government justcollapse? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge, the intruder may try to reinstate <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Type? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've got less than nine minutes before the storm reachesthe northern perimeter. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Describe it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were just talking about you, Wyatt. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you ever heard anything like this, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Leyor, the Federation would like to negotiate a trade agreementin which we could acquire your planet's rich deposits of trillium 323which we would add to our bid, Premier Bhavani. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They found her, didn't they? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whoever did this could still be on the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's certainly good to know. Would you like something todrink? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We should call Starbase 74, and see if anyone can decipher this. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know whose voice activates it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Initiate auto-destruct? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Which means exactly what? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and armthe photontorpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Belay that order. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, yourFirst Officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will stepoutside follow Lieutenant Lewis. He will assign you to your crewquarters. Ensign, you're here on the exchangeprogramme. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To your success, doctor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Okona, if you follow Commander Data, you can get startedright away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess I'd start looking for a new career. There must be aplace where someone with fifteen years of Starfleet technical knowledgewould be useful. You wouldn't happen to know a place like that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ship's stabilisers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good evening. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hello? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I need some information about a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It wassent to you a few years ago. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My guess would be a lone survey ship. Maybe a dozen or sosurvivors. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Never cared for it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The fact that it's travelling at its presentvelocity suggests a possible answer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My friend tells me you might know about the man we're lookingfor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. Admiral, Deanna, I need a moment with you. CommanderData, if you would accompany the Ambassador on his tour. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is thus area secure? Can we talk? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, Tog! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you for coming on board, Mister Dokachin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't believe you did that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Follow him. Let's go! Come on, come on! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Beverly. I'm saying this to you as a friend. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then why are you acting so excited? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Will he return to the planet? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Young Mister Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you ever wonder if we did the right thing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothingwrong. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your eyes. What happened to your visor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This looks like anything but farmland. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My friend tells me you know about the man we're looking for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Positronic brain of yours and carry outyour mission. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Allowing them access to our computer is a complete breech ofStarfleet security. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It may have been connected to the main system, and when shelowered the shield she may have turned that off as well. If not, we'lldeal with it as best we can. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I can be. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Data to the Bridge immediately. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Concur. Ensign, slow down to half impulse power. Adjustcoordinates to intercept this, this whatever it is. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolatedincident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in thatcorridor. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate,fully trained in many areas including shuttles. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have some gaps in the aft shields, Captain. When thetorpedoes explode, these areas will be contaminated withion radiation. We need to evacuate sections twenty four to forty seven,decks thirty five through thirty eight. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know why we're going to this pulsar. And creeping up on it at half impulse makes even less sense. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I realise that, Mister Data. I'd rather face a court martialthan live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths. Commander Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've picked up a vessel on the long range scanners, headed thisway. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can provide you with a kitchen, but it won't really benecessary. These food dispensers can synthesise anything that you maybeen. I'll show you. Sovereign, may I offer you a drink? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you need help? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not a Klingon. I don't think there's any shame in someone being injured. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, allow me to present SpecialFederation Emissary K'Ehleyr. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, listen to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do you know anything about this, Mister Data? Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, report to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Have you picked it up on the sensors? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're picking up an energy field on the planetsurface. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, I can't help you. I don't know these people. I haven'ttalked to them. You have. Use that fancy <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very good. At this rate we'll be able to bring the next wave ofcolonists in in about six months. I've to tell you I envy you. This isa beautiful place to put down roots. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Any other ships respond to our queries, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I tried at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't even talk to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Problem, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The coroner saidthis is where they kept all the cholera victims. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall onyou. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you are personally responsible for the Captain'ssafety. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Those Ferengi have iron jaws. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where's Captain Picard? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How do they open the conduits? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We don't understand the source of your misgivings, Mistress, butwe appreciate your faith in us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How was the reception? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Identification? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Your mother. She's worried about you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd think she'd at least get to her own wedding on time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Helm, set course for Bersallis Three. Warp five. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All hands will stand to battle stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, I haven't remembered a day for the last sixteen years. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get us out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And we still have more faults <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All engines back full. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Surprisingly good. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My pleasure, sir. Ma'am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not real. It's not real. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe by uncovering all this, we run the risk of upsetting thestalemate. Maybe we should leave well enough alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who does he think he is? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Denied. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get some rest. You've had a rough couple of days. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I heard another Rossa was killed in action at the Krasneroutpost. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nervous? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you make of this, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enough to turn them back, but not enough tohurt them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It certainly is. We'll try to make you as comfortable aspossible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd think they'd at least give us a hint. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we go to warp? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: An aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance sexualpleasure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a welcome mat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: See you on board. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Generator's right over there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And how much might anything be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No one has ever offered to turn me into a god before. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, if anyone else had said that, I'd suspect he was bragging. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The port engine's down. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I was afraid. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can you make balso tonic? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But that's what you're talking about anyway, isn't it? Alteringthe past. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Chief O'Brien in Ten Forward? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by for subwarp. Head for standard orbit of Data's planet. I wonder why Data hasn't come up here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then take your best shot, Locutus, because we're about tointervene. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It really is delicious. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Captain has decided to go with your recommendation, butthat's not the point. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think you should pursue it. First of all,she's a beautiful woman. She seems to be crazy about you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander. Commander. A second ago I knew who I was. I wason the ship. I was in a play. And now I'm having trouble rememberinganything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're about to force the door. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, if you take the Bridge Officer's test, you'll have mycomplete support. But as First Officer, I'll be the one judging yourperformance, and you should know I am a pretty tough judge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Check out the primary system. See if you can get some powerto the rest of these consoles. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And that stopped his heart? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Alright, I was probably a little younger than he is. It's justthat, for all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father andhe almost kills himself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's like candy to them. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Reroute systems to primary hull power sources. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Warp speed, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought it was more important that the Romulans <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Keep it up, Lefler. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Survey team here. Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Even if we get the Sheliak to talk, they're not likely to beaccommodating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you might like to see this. Geordi's analysis of thesubspace distortion the Borg used to escape. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wantsanswered. He suggests that I take you with me on the away team thatI'll be leading. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Transporter Chief. Pick up thecoordinates of the bell jar in the Medical Lab for return to VelaraThree. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you'll excuse me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's your status? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This bug is persistent, I'll admit that. But I'm not worried. WeRikers are ornery, too. As a matter of fact, my great grandfather oncegot bit by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain, the snakedied. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If you're trying to motivate us to find <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm glad to hear you say so, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I thought you had compensated for that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. I'm not sure which one to feel sorry for. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I did. He just didn't like what I had to say. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where did they get their shields? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is the away team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I keep seeing this design. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, I have no family. I can't stay here. I have to get back. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are about to lose warp drive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many people on board are capable of doing this, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Try a manual bypass of the damping systems. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Speed being the most obvious. This ship literally just thinkswhat it wants, and then it happens. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And just as the headsman swings his axe, theblade is about to fall <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, where is Lieutenant La Forge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. You? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's happened? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby, you'll lead the away team. Make it so. First officer's log, stardate 43998.5. Our pursuitof the Borg continues on a course that will take us to the very core ofthe Federation. The devastation they could bring is beyond imagination. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe we called their bluff. Status, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What punishment? Name it! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Almost? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm clear. Energise! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fleming on long range sensors, approximatelyzero point three light years away. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Round up everybody who was left behind. Take cover. Try to avoidany contact with the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by to dock. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we can relax, Mister Worf. They can't even move theirship without our help. We certainly have them outmanned and outgunned. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Good to see you, too. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: A surprise party? Mister Worf, I hate surprise parties. I wouldnever do that to you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell. Nobody said life was safe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Nevertheless, Chief Delegate, you're on notice that all of yourweapons, no matter what their basic function, are being confiscated. Violence will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's working. The radiation levels are dropping to normal. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: D'Amato's been an exemplary officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Security Chief. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The entity, has it abandoned him? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I didn't want to leave without sayinggood-bye. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we're going to be all right in here. I'm not sure aboutthe air supply, so stay put, don't move around. Don't expendunnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thingout. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything has been programmed to operate onvoice command. you just tell the computer where you want to go. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Heavy casualties in the secondary hull. Navigational sensorarray inoperative. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How many people were assigned to this outpost? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Amazing. I never thought I would ever see a Romulan ship. Notthis close. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're having trouble reading you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wesley! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we go through there, where will we be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As the First Officer, I feel it's my responsibility to show youall the amenities. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Something I can take care of for you on Starbase Five One Five? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. There's a delegation of Ferengi who wishes to bebeamed aboard, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, everyone in this roomshares my respect for your service to this ship. But right now, I needyour experience at tactical. Commander Data, I realise your very natureomits ambition. Nevertheless, I want you to know I seriously consideredyou first officer. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not that we don't believe you. It's just hard to see howboth stories could be true. Would you be willing have our Doctor checkyou out? 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER:  <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status of Borg weapons? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, aboard the Enterprise. We demand thatyou Cut that off! They're not going to besatisfied with anyone less than the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, set in a course that follows those currents. Commander Shelby, prepare to initiate your plan to separate the saucersection when we find the Borg. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Captain BenjaminMaxwell. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well. right now I think you should be in Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I suggest you drop it, Mister Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He does? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I just did. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long till meltdown? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Can we beam one over? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's all right. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're worried. They're worried because we've got access toPicard. Mister Data, we have two minutes to figure out what we can dowith it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are taking the survivors to Sickbay. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was its origin point? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fine. I'll have time to go get him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I must. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Bringing it here personally, perhaps with the idea of being onhand for the Ferengi beam over, might have imperiled this vessel had itbeen something hostile approaching. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Continue with the testing, Mister Worf. Here's the finalschedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers. By theway, I'm looking forward to meeting your parents. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And Alpha moon? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, what? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gaps? From what I saw, I find that hard to believe. Yourecreated the Enterprise, the crew, every nuance and smell, sound, withperfect accurate. I didn't see any gaps. I don't buy it, Tomalak. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: But what happened to my memory? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You control my every move, tell me what tosay, what to think. What to eat, what to say. What to think, what toeat. Then when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap medown, inject me with drugs, call it a treatment. I may be surrounded byinsanity, but I am not insane. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, the array has already been allocated to Engineering. They're running some warp field tests. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With Data, on the edge of the old city, sir. It's being hithard, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, no more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I wonder if the strong magnetic field of their sun might havesomething to do with it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set automatic locking device. Alert Shuttlebay two. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We've found something else. A novel by ToddMatthews, entitled Hotel Royale, which is the name of this structure. Data. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, ready photon torpedoes. Set to detonate on impactwith the Promellian vessel. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sir, if you'd like my opinion <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What would that be? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You seem awfully tense for a man who just came back fromvacation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He couldn't understand why I did it. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That may not be Lieutenant Uhnari. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. I think we have. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see any ofthis. You're not involved. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf, I want you to assemble a security team, take a shuttledown to the planet, bring back the captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You are from a different time, aren't you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I guess so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell her no. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the hell happened here? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our own way out of here, you've succeeded,Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data, hurry. Ship's log, First Officer Riker. Enterprise will bedestroyed unless it can be moved out of thepath of the star material hurtling toward us. Our only hope is forLieutenant Commander Data, in the time we have left, to regainhis senses and reconnect engine power to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You know, I've been thinking we should probably let Dad knowwhat happened. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader ofanother world. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who says I'm looking for anybody? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Exactly what does that mean? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What the? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Everything I wanted? You probed the Enterprise. You lured ushere so you could play games with me. I didn't want that, you did. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Just stored. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As I hope it will benefit mine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of coldthat's coming. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This just came in for you from Starfleet <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What type of radiation signature? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Vacuum preserved everything. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Increase power! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where is she? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set heading for Starbase Five One Five, warp nine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. I suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission toStarfleet Headquarters. Mister Data, prepare to launch three level-fiveprobes. Ensign, aft thrusters. Standard observation posture. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And it paid off. He received the top grade and now that sametest has four options. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get away from me! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When the Enterprise comes back tomorrow, we'll get a crewstarted on that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: To the bitter end? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Security! Red Alert! Restrain the Captain! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You always had an advantage. A little bit of control of everysituation. That must have been a very safe position to be in. To behonest, I'd always thought there was something a little tooaristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. As if your human side wasn'tquite good enough for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Crusher. Actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then we'll search them again. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's more than I expected. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Do you hear me? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We have to assume one thing, sir. Wherever Data may be, he'sdoing the same thing we are, which is trying to get to the bottom ofthis. He may have a better idea about what's going on than we do, so itmight be in the best interests of this mission to find him. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I saw you. I thought I might join you for a stroll. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No demands, no political statements, no theft. They must wantsomething. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no power on this entire deck, yet somehow these monitorsare working. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've detected some sort of debris in a loose orbit. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not that I know of. I'd be more than willing to put it behindme. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You mean we could have come into this room, sat at this tableand had this conversation a dozen times already? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You did it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So none of the background which we have provided would behelpful in understanding why they continue to fight? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And then you became part of their crew? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With what? We have no offensive weapons. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And create the temple? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana, Deanna. Anything I can do for you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I will miss you, Deanna. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it's over? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why the past two years? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Go to Red Alert! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Thank you. It's good to see you again, Captain. It's been a longtime. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Got it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shall we begin the scientific tests you wanted, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: He hasn't been doing a very good job. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, recommend we try to destroy the hologram generationsthemselves. Is that possible, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. Data, separate yourself from Captain Picard. Away Team, get yourselves home. Mister Crusher, upon their return moveus to a safe position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality ofhis mother's death. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Two are lost, sir. But we saved four. I'm Commander WilliamRiker of the Enterprise. I'm sorry we were unable to rescue theother two. We did everything we could. If you had come instead ofsending your cargo, you all would have made it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not worried about Tin Man. It's more Romulans showing up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Request permission to begin planning a rescueoperation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Remember Sandoval? Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. Fang-lee? Marla Aster? Tasha Yar? How many men and women, how many friends have we watched die? I've lost count. Every one of them, every single one fought for life until the very end. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When it comes to this ship and this crew, you're damned right Iplay it safe. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Possibly. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign. You're dismissed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's a good deal of structural integrity, Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And the other one, his assistant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, stand by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In a Galaxy Class starship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything. A fingernail, a hair. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm positive. After everything that I've experienced, I don'tthink I could sleep knowing it was still up. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

 <bos> RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Borg seem to be using theircombined power to repair the ship. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Completely calm, no sound, no movement, yeta few hundred metres away a storm is raging. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Let's be ready for anything. Energise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, no. Minutes is fine. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Their reason is part of their binary thinking. For them thereare only two choices. One or zero. Yes or no. Why did you lure me to the holodeck and hold methere. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With all this interference it could be a hundred metres away andwe wouldn't know it. This could take hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Next time, don't give up so easily. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then pick the body and let's get out of here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't Lieutenant Worf scheduled to replace Ensign Torigan? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Obviously, Starfleet will want to know more. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lotof energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Otherscouldn't care less. There are no rules. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it wise to send two humanfugitives in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt village? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Come in. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What could do that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I'm not trying to put any pressure on you. I'm sure myreport will only underscore the need for continuedsupport of your research. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Maybe, but we need to figure out how to use it. How is he? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, Please repeat the file. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What am I seeing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've recruited a few Prytt spies. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Really? RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And you have a lot to learn, Commander. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We hope we're not interrupting anything important, Captain, butwe wanted to inform you that we have achieved orbit around Risa andwe're ready to beam you aboard at your convenience. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you know about <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The replicators on decks four through nine are producing nothingbut cat food. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Eighty one kilos. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, he hated it. That's why he left the chore to me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Captain Kargan. He wasacting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Serve this shipas I have! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Outer hull breach. She must have had an internal explosion. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I like one who's intelligent and sure of herself, who I can talkwith and get something back. But the most important thing of all? Shehas to laugh at my jokes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: There's no record of the Romulans ever assaulting the EnterpriseC. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Then what were you doing there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi, Worf, you're with me. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know what you mean. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's the situation? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Apparently he was so anxious to be join the awayteam, he left a very critical experiment unattended. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you ready, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I may. After this tour, I may have some worthy questions. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or you could have been intimidated. It's tough to tell otherpeople what to do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Too slow to be a photon torpedo. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And absolute power corrupts absolutely. Do you believe I haven'tthought of that, Jean-Luc? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Whose emotions were they? I thought you said were alone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All decks, stand by. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Now. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't really think I'm going to help you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Our destination is the Endicor system. We're due to arrive inthree days. The charts show nothing of consequence, certainly nothingto threaten the Enterprise, between here and there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How, Geordi? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Get back here! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what are you doing? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: All right, 1e're almost there. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I would look up into the sky and I'd think, if Itried hard enough, I could make you feel my presence. That if I couldlet you know that I was alive, maybe you'd wait for me. I know itsounds crazy, but there were times when I could've sworn. What am Italking about? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What do you make of these? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treatyviolation. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Permission to speak freely, sir? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not yet. We don't know how long it'll stay that way. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're with me, Mister Worf. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've located a planet thatmay still support life. We'll know in a minute. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're early. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Who built you, Commander? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: May I present Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're lying. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Let's give it a try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Over here, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You don't think Worf would allow them access to the battlebridge? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd never survive. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The wars are over, Yuta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: No, sir. I'll release her, of course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So, who won the contest? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Planetary defences? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She seems to be fine. He wasn't able to establish a link on her. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The hell you don't. You're two moves away from being mated. See,you should have listened to me. Now you've only got one possibleescape. That wasn't it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've been meaning to visit the mall myself. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: My people won't stop looking for me, Tomalak. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Doctor? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Would I seem ungrateful if I ask for some information? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Getting sensor readings. They're unconscious but they're alive. Stand by. I'm going to transport them over here. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Uh huh. I see that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Too bad. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Halt. I know how hard this is for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Hugh? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Collapsing protostars sometimes emit E-band bursts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The old Bandi city's being hit hard, sir. Many casualties veryprobable. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What about communications, sensors, life support? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What can you tell us? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Course to Station McKinley ready and laid in, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They were adamant. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Wait! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It is me. It's what I am. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: According to the schematics, the engineering computer coreaccess is down that corridor. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: With pleasure, sir. Ensign Crusher, set course for Emila Two,warp three. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range ofseveral Federation outposts. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, let's give it a try. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We were in this sector on another mission, and since you hadalready contacted Starfleet about additional dicosilium, it seemed likea good opportunity. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's only used for defence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's like the eye of a hurricane. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: La Forge. Proceed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You'd better check it out. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Position? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't like it I would've expected a greeting party. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. Are you there? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Are you aware of the infectious nature of the parasites whichinhabit cove palm? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why would they go through the charade of needing our help? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I've never settled for anything in my life. I know what I want,I know what I've got, and you'd be lucky to do as well. Lieutenant. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Gul Lemec, as you know. the systems are still subject tonegotiation by the terms of the treaty. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We could transfer the away team right into this intersection. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The wave is gaining on us. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: What's going to happen to the mercenaries? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It seems awfully strange that a malfunctioning sensor would givesuch a specific misreading of a planet. I would have thought that atime-space disturbance would have caused a lot more confusion thanthat. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Damage reports ready for your review. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I don't know if it was enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So you resign? You walk away from all the people who care aboutyou? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We think we should take a look for ourselves. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Sure, why not. How did you learn todance so well? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Repeat, Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It's no weapon. The Enterprise has no reason to do that,especially with me on board. It makes no sense. Why? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're all dead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Well, at least now we have something to go on. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: As I said, all dead. Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading theresearch information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I amconcerned at being in such close orbit, but the Tsiolkovsky's researchrecords will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole, Captain. I think he's the logical choice. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships rising on anintercept course. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is the away team. We'reclear of the structure. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: So they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to re-enterRomulan space. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This air's pretty stale. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Is the deflector ready? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Fire! <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf! Where are you Worf? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not one of you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: She said that? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I do. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I would prefer to find a peaceful solution. If we could talk ourway out of this one, that much the better. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: And yet in both the past and the present there's a report of thesame anomaly in the Devron System. I find it hard to believe thatthat's a coincidence. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Why wasn't I affected? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best to get it out of here as quickly as possible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You suspect trouble? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I know that, but I have to do something. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Firing photon torpedoes. Full spread. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Okay, notify the away team that we're going in ahead ofschedule. I'll tell the Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, take us to the designated coordinates. RO <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: The Hera is reason enough. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advancenavigation at the Academy provides the student with three options. Ricewas given this test, rejected their options and offered one of his own. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Anything on that design, Data? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Certainly, history never meant for this ship to go into battlewithout her captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Starfleet is stretched pretty thin acrossthe quadrant. There are only about twelve ships within a day's travelof this position. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: How did it get in? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: It will cut down their response time. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Along the same principle as that which is draining energy fromour ships. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm sure we'd know. One does not patronise a Klingon warrior. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Barclay? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Human beings have other ways of doing that. We have children. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Or anywhere else along the Neutral Zone. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm not that hungry. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Solid propellant? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That damn ringing. Answer it, will you? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: They're in stasis. Medical team to the Bridge. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's not possible. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lock on phasers. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We can't stay, Captain. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Data, what have we got? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: This game is now wearing very thin. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: In order to do thatRIKER <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Tell him, Yuta. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If I didn't know you better, I'd say that you wereprocrastinating. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Ever since he came on board, I find myself thinking about thechoice you and I made. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Worf. Geordi. Troi. Join me in transporter room three for anaway team. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Stand by, all stations. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data ? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Unfortunately. Let's find the others. What do you make of these? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Isn't there something you can do to counteract it? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Cancel red alert. Clearly I need to be briefed. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Deanna, this is nothing personal. Not everyone is cut out to bea Bridge Officer. I don't think this is for you. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: You've been down here dozens of times. I'm sure you know thebest way. 2 <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: If we must play a game, what would we win? Q <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Only you could have noticed something like that. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Where are we, Ensign? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: That's all you care about, starting these damn experimentsagain. Look around. This room is filled with dead bodies. These peopledied because of this thing. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, fire phasers on full with a simultaneous spreadof torpedoes. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Status of the Borg ship? <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid so. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Eleven hours. <eos>
 <bos> RIKER: Absolutely, sir. <eos>
