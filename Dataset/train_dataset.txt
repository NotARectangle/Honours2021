<bos> PICARD: Transporter room two, prepare to energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There was a woman who was frightened. And then you saw heragain, laughing, presumably at Lieutenant Kwan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless it's followed by? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's only. There's just one thing I don't understand. You weresuch a rotten swimmer, Louis. Thinking of you working on the oceanfloor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's so much I wanted to tell you. The Academy, there'ssomeone, someone who meant a great deal to me. He's been there forever. Someone you must get to know. His name is Boothby. Now, you tell himthat you and I were friends. Now, when I was there, he helped me. Listen to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at theAcademy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelledfor what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on boardthis ship. You're dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire at will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Both of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll have to check the craft for something to protect ourheads and eyes. And Captain, please recover your medical supplies, foodand water rations <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time to intercept? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What went wrong this time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's not dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: An extremely large storm system overthe Caldos colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, override its destination. Divert that turbolift to aposition near Lieutenant Worf's present location. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My pleasure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Follow your orders? The orders of a small man trying to fill arole too big for him. I say it's time for a change. Who's with me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. Computer locate Tam Elbrun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you may continue the diagnostic of the transportersystems at another time. Take a shuttlecraft and two more engineersdown to the Romulan ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratorymaze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how wellwe react under pressure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's certainly no joke. As you can see, we are physically quitedifferent from Malcorians. And, with your permission, I'm prepared toprove it to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What precipitated the attack? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the transport still under attack? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay hereuntil we find it, no matter how long it takes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because, because you've lost the capacity for self-judgment. Now, alcohol does this, Wesley. But this contaminant we've brought backfrom the Tsiolkovsky does it even more so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortlyafter your arrival. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As to that, there's no option. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is there any way to determine what the destinationof the parent might have been? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may have done too much to help them already, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For the experience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's good to see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They know that the Ornarans no longer have the plague. Theyknow that felicium is no longer a medicine. So, of course, they arewilling to give this shipment because they don't want to take thechance that the Ornarans will lose their addiction. They don't want tolose their only customers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An explosive device at the mission site. She died instantly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut it off. Mister La Forge, lay in a course on thosecoordinates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think when one has been angry for a very long time, one getsused to it. And it becomes comfortable, like old leather. And, finally,it becomes so familiar that one can't ever remember feeling any otherway. Thank you, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the Romulans are suddenly very interestedin bonding with the Vulcans. Spock has been meeting with the new SenateProconsul about reunification. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard, class of twenty seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. That is absolutely out of the question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From the same source as before? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have just given the computer my command codes, thinking Iwould get control of the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we could get to the root command, we could introduce aninvasive programming sequence through its biochip system and thenreturn it to the hive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there's a possibility of getting more from him, I'd like youto pursue it. But we need to continue our investigation. We'll enterthe Black Cluster at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled asyou, but I'm not inexperienced. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Wereyou abducted from Chalna? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the news were encouraging, I assume youwould not be here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I am more concerned with protecting the honour andintegrity of Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't miss this for the world. How oldare you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what the hell is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't expose the Enterprise until I know where this diseasecame from and how it is transmitted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, have you any idea what has just happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to compile the data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can that be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, why isn't myship <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's exactly what I needed. Well done, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, how do you intend to free yourselves of this existencethat has so trapped your consciousness? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put that area on the main viewer. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then formulate this one. How do I deal Riker and the Hathaway? I will await your answer on the Bridge. And, Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank Aunt Adele. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yet her neural activity is practically non-existent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very bitter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you telling me there's no water? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, would you join me in my Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you took Sovak's money. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That you were looking forward to meeting him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, Are our problems likely to attain theseriousness of those on the Yamato? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Brace yourself for impact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think thatyou are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathyfor what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don'tthink that you can really be in love with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in intercept course. Go to yellow alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please sit down. Guinan is very selective about whom she callsa friend. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you think it was? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Steady on that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is correct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're telling me this is another computer glitch? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I should meet with this Acost Jared. He's still ourbest hope for the release of the hostages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll talk to her about it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, well, he's evidently done more than hold together. He'sthe indispensable man. The Federation's finest specialist incommunication with unknown life forms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Options? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dixon Hill. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes, indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin the pass. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond thosefunctions and is developing a new capacity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, would you consent to being examined by Commander LaForge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We tookyou away from it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactoryexplanation of this. Director Mandl. Lieutenant Yar, would you escortthe Director to his quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is our velocity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr. This is an unexpected pleasure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you remember anything else? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight. And may your cloak bringyou all you deserve. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to. If we don't seal that hole, this other dimensionhe's opened will rip into the fabric of the galaxy. Reality as weperceive it will not be the same. Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, go to warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maques, is it possible that your telepathic communications withMrs Troi harmed her in some way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, of course not, Number One. Please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They brought a lot of technology. Where is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on downthere is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's always a chess game with them, isn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must convince me. If I had irrefutable evidence? But youdid not bring irrefutable evidence. You brought no evidence at all. Now, here, you are not the man you claimed to be. Admiral, yourcredibility is stretched beyond belief. A Romulan defector is almost acontradiction in terms. But Admiral Jarok crossing the lines? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Plot an intercept course, Ensign. Fire torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Locate Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it trying to learn? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Data. Propose it to the nanites. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we're still friends. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I've just been recollecting the arrival of a newFirst Officer on board the Enterprise, and a manual docking confidentlyachieved. I may have been somewhat miserly in my congratulations then,so let me make up for it now. The Captain of the Starship Ares isretiring. Congratulations. You've been selected as his replacement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate launch sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In fact I authorise and support your idea, Riker. Please, feelfree to cooperate with him if you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tragedy seems to follow that family. The Admiral lost both hersons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, can you improve our reception? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and theplanet. Force fields full on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are only so many ways to Ten Forward. Ten Forward is thelogical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume the work is progressing on the conference room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. Er, thank you. Look at that. Her right shoulder. That isthe same place that Data stabbed her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An android? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Abort and destroy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, we'll proceed to Indri Eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you locked on to that transmission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm movingback and forth through time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems you woke your Tin Man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many people are down there? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: When did this start? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am glad you are comfortable. I've come to seek your agreementto an Ornaran request. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter howstrange they may seem to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patched is good enough. Well done. Beamback immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The millions of people down there who are watching as theirmoon falls out of the sky. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I so challenge. Convene your hearing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to reverse engines. Full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Drop to impulse. Take us in, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a dampening field. This entire structure could be shieldedfrom our sensors. Let's go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the interim, the Academy's loss is our gain. The Enterprisewill continue to benefit from your talents for another year. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of amutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading toa trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like areasonable course of action to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you need an undercover operative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you take your position? Mister Crusher? Layin a course for the starbase on Otar Two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent diplomaticrelations with this planet. Mister Data, is there any other pertinentinformation before we reply? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite original. How long before a total systems failure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Every living thing on the planet will perish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we may have a solution. We have a sample of your normalDNA to use as a filter in the transporter. We think that we can beamyou aboard while filtering out any of the genetic problems caused bythe disease. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. Lay in a course for theMorgana Quadrant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we talk to him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I heard that. They were not words exactly. A sudden sense offear. A sense of fear of heights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's no way out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explanation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Last month. Just kicked in without any warning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, fix coordinates onto that vessel. We'll justbeam the whole thing to a shuttlebay if we have to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't you answer my questions? What ship? I'd like to lookat the passenger list. Where have you been living here? What's yourposition? Who are your neighbours? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Counsellor, are you in position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's begun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Knowing where the flaw is located, can you isolate the problemand solve it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well then my First Officer <eos> <bos> PICARD: After what happened on Garon Two, she has no business servingon any starship, let alone the flagship, my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What has happened to bring you to that conclusion? That's quitea big jump. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm not surprised. Its sun went nova more than a thousandyears ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you need my help in this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Surely he must have logged the cause of the ship's death. Whatcaptain wouldn't? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Launch torpedo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, stop! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shallwe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that you're willing to go to war over this boy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when did I learn to play it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millionsof lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that same path again. Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us onelast chance for peace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Specify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only because their world was the first on this heading toParliament. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan was suddenlygoing to announce that he wanted you for his First One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's very impressive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does he need to begin making use of that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll hold position while we seek an explanation for theseanomalies. Let's divert all our resources to that end. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Apgar, you understand the purpose of this hearing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bringing it up here was the right thing todo, Number One. We were just saying, Data, that if your duplicatefunctions, it might answer a lot of questions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Under these circumstances, Number One, I think that would beinappropriate. Second officer's log, Stardate 43611.6. Programmingof the holodeck has taken eighteen hours eleven minutes, and is nowcomplete. All participants have entered their depositions. Technicalschematics and complete records from the lab's ground computers, aswell as Doctor Apgar's personal logs, have been included. Therecreations will have a nominal eight point seven percent margin oferror. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data estimated time to intercept with the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough! I'm not going to fight you. You'll just have to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were Amanda's parents executed by the Q Continuum? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warn them we'll return fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before you have it in position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Long range scan, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. I know. It has been hard on you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have our passenger's accommodations met with theirapproval? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What progress on the matter-antimatter scan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, You must return to theEnterprise immediately. Counsellor Troi is dying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how are you coming with that comm. link? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impressions, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No matter how tempted? No matter how difficult Q makes it foryou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No thank you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Well, where the hell are we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, take us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted newspecies, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my Security Chief, Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn it. I can't even make a log entry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A Corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here. Wehave detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed anylight on this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Are we within sensor range of thenebula? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I think that falls into this category. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. La Forge, contact Commander Riker. Worf, check alldecks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. And you caninform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have the exact location? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's understandable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just follow my lead with the Ambassador. You'll be fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are not alive. As I said before, you are only <eos> <bos> PICARD: See if you can find out any more details, Mister Data. I'd liketo know more about that storm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Welcome to the Bridge. Please, sit down. How isCounsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, this is the Captain. We have arrived. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We didn't know that. We didn't even know if you were real. Allwe knew was that a little girl's imaginary friend was frightening her,threatening her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to ourmutual problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, what was the last known location of Commander LaForge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Advise all personnel on deck thirty eight to stay out of thecargo bays. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive andit must stop. You have kept information from me since our firstcommunication. An alien life form has taken possession of my MedicalLab. You knew of its existence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And as I watched Worf, it was like lookingat a man that I had never known. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option. Proceed, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ignite the plasma. That's exactly what they were trying to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Contact Starfleet. Find out what they know about Korris andcompany. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to meet your mother. Can you arrange that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For what purpose? What <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room. You're out of time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to know that I am not unsympathetic to what you'regoing through. Your mother's disappearance is tragic, but I cannot riskyour safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will assist us to assimilate this vessel. You are Borg. Youwill assist us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your concern is noted, Doctor, but anyintervention on our part would alert the Borg to our having been here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We both fell down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to know about her biological parents, about their death. I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope not, Number One. Mister La Forge, prepare to take us outof orbit. Set course for Isis Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, when you're finished with your duties inEngineering, report to my Ready Room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Karnas, this is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you the Admiral iscritically ill. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not an away team, Commander. I consider this aceremonial function. For me not to go could be construed as lack ofinterest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your recommendations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But Ardra must have purified the polluted water and air? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I switched the transponder codes. Given his feelings about me,it seemed a sensible thing to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we're causing it. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get me the Sheliak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A marshal of France? Ridiculous! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: When can you start? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I'll tell them to be cautious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need your help. The situation is not good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to get as much information as possible about thatanomaly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, I want you to access thetransformation programme. And when you're ready, input the symbol. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We could find some other quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've had to send people on far more dangerous missions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rene already told me. Where is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Change course to intercept. I'm on my way. I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, overlay weapon ranges of the two ships. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Too risky. You could be pulled in too. Bridge to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's get back to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, there might come some time in the future when she wouldfind out anyway. Another accident, perhaps. Maybe it would be easierfor her if she learned the truth from you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bringthis life form into being. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Despite your progress, you are a divided society, and so itwill remain until the Gatherers return to Acamar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you are endangering yourself and the away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know that, Data, but what could itbe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then this endeavour dies here, in this room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Since the days of the first wooden sailing ships, all captainshave enjoyed the happy privilege of joining together two people in thebonds of matrimony. And so it is my honour to unite you, KeikoIshikawa, and you, Miles Edward O'Brien, together in matrimony <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, this situation is more serious than you realise. Inless than five hours, those two planets will collide and a new starwill form. Unless we move to a safe distance, this vessel will bedestroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what the hell is going on here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, then. There's still that anomalous class-M planet we weregoing to investigate. Ensign, replot a course to take us back to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, where is Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attacked it ? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course, bearing one eightseven mark one zero two, one quarter impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: We most certainly are not. Now listen to me. No one here isgoing to die. The bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon aspossible. So I want you all to stop crying. Everything is going to beall right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos> <bos> PICARD: They will live their lives and never know any difference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine firstcommand. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: let's proceed with the shuttle plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker has dramaticallydemonstrated to this court that Lieutenant Commander Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. Because it is not relevant. We too are machines,just machines of a different type. Commander Rikerhas also reminded us that Lieutenant Commander Data was created by ahuman. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant. Children arecreated from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are theyproperty? I call Lieutenant Commander Data to the stand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this part of the same pattern? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were taking her to places that were inappropriate, evendangerous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem you two have a lot to discuss. If you'll excuseme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, but there is. You're a fraud, madame, and I intend to provethat you could not have affected the changes that took place on thisplanet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll never get away with this. Starfleet will never stand andwatch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if I hand you over to Debin, then it's the same thing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will provide you with clothing, food and clean water. Lieutenant Worf demonstrate its operation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, keep with it, Doctor. Starfleet has very importantbusiness for us as soon as the away team returns. I don't fancy theidea of my crew being infected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am alsobound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. And Iwill not sacrifice them in order to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you locate the shuttle? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection! <eos> <bos> PICARD: This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Nowwho gave you that order? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're probably not aware of this, but I have never beenparticularly comfortable around children. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I am not dead. Because I refuse to believe that theafterlife is run by you. The universe is not so badly designed. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lower the forcefield. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's enough, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what do I do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when I tell you, pull up hard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they were hoping to find someone in Starfleet like you,Admiral, naive enough to solve their Bajoran problem for them. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Satisfactory? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And how long will you keep him there? A week? A month? A year? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, could this be a Dyson Sphere? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, orthat you're insane. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew,welcome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not even the stars. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. When it's done I want you to find some way of collapsingthis anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis ofwhatever solution you come up with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to speak with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard, epsilon seven nine three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size andintent. We're here alone. We must assume the worst. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, as you can see, we're back where it all started. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circlinghigh above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object. A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real. At least, it's not completely solid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems we are becoming detectives, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A slight navigational error? Nearly half a light year past theNeutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the cause is just and honourable, they are prepared to givetheir lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will, you'reready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And, youknow, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not a violent man? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I spent many an hour there. It was my favourite spot to study. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No luck? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty fourhours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed withoutincident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face somecritical test. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must see Sarek. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wonder what they're thinking over there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, good lord, a highwayman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please come to my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in yourdress uniform for Admiral Quinn's farewell dinner? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we'll find an alternative route. Let's go back up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So the entire ship has been affected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it seems to be humanoid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach. Ambassador, I have tell you that in my culture, what you have donewould be considered a crime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Progress? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for Federation territory, warp two. Engage. MisterData, I want you to take charge of this investigation. Study computerlogs, sensor information everything. I refuse to believe that this wasa simple malfunction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Photon torpedoes. Maximum yield, full spread. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know exactly what I mean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek. I'm sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmlands here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, set in warp one point five,retroactive course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not any more? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker says the planet's life forms are almost identical to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't touch him! <eos> <bos> PICARD: You never told me about this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I trust him completely. But everyone should also realise thatthat was a necessary and legitimate security question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. Theywould learn about alien worlds, starships. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was not my question, Number One. What caused themalfunctions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The other colony? Captain's log, supplemental. A review of stellarcharts has revealed a Class M planet only half a light year from theBringloid system. I am proceeding on the premise that it was thedestination of the colony which possessed the more sophisticatedequipment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did Wesley's flight recorder indicate that there was anythingunusual about the ship or the way it was operating? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand your feelings, Number One. I share them. Butperhaps the fault lies in ourselves. We were so eager to accept her. Each of us, myself included, wanted to see something of Tasha in thiswoman. We saw more than what was there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, have a safe trip home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can assure you it was not through official channels. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're accommodating you in quartersnormally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find themquite comfortable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. I want you to sever your connection to your mother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, please, let's not indulge in speculation. Can weconfine our discussion to facts? Now, Mister O'Brien <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But we can't stay in this area too long. You have ninehours. If you can get her underway by then,we'll escort her back to Starbase one oh five. If not, we'll evacuatethe survivors and destroy the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My love is a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseththe disease. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is. Paul Manheim. Fifteen years ago he went off to workon experiments relating to non-linear time. It appears he may haveachieved some measure of success. Speed warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's true that our presence here has had an unintendedinfluence on your society. But it's done and thereis no way to undo it. But feelings are running very high. Perhaps it'snot such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weighcarefully the consequences of what you're about to do. We are preparedto return in six months. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, if you have course and speed laid in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish, you can stay on board while we wait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see? You knew how to laugh once. Do you remember any ofthis, Jono? Your parents, your home? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't want you involved in this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to acrew can damage your credibility as a leader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what regard? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbedduring the voyage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My head. Oh. Dizzy. I can't. No! No! <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop, and hold this position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell. If we couldduplicate Deanna's pheromones and then convince him she's no longer inSickbay, that she'd gone into some other part of the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Miller, if I could have prevented this I would have. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you recognize this planet, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't care. Let's just get some distance between us and thissystem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, andthat unity said something about them. That they had resolved certainsocial and political differences and they were now ready to become parta larger community. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the Klingon ship, the Pagh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inversetachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing lookslike. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I assume that if you choose go to the cargo bay, thenyou won't to take all of the hostages. Their safety is my chiefpriority. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he wasafraid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, resume programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, thank you. New orders from Starfleet. The rendezvous. Nothing, thank you. The rendezvous with the Goddard hasbeen postponed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You took some unnecessary personal risks, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand thesethings? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Director, we will comply with your request to remove the colonyfrom Tau Cygna Five, but we need time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not until we have someplace to go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until what, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've given me nothing to believe in. Just a lot of vague talkabout strange patterns, irrational proposals. Who's behind this, and towhat purpose? How are people being changed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It happened when I reached for the bowl of fruit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know everything I do, Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, assemble your team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any luck with the tricorder, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You did know La Forge longer than any of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In one hour, DaiMon Bok. End transmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must be out of my mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe that one of you has a fragment from Indri Eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you lock onto our signals. I want you to beam CounsellorTroi to <eos> <bos> PICARD: I really wonder. Halt. I've always believed that carryingchildren on a starship is a very questionable policy. Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks, certain dangers. Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Course one one eight mark three five seven, full impulsepower. Signal the fleet to get underway. We'll enter warp once we'reclear of the system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Forge, set in warp one point five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even if I had reason to believe that would be successful, Idon't think that I could sanction it. Please understand, Professor,that you are in essence a new life form. One that we didn't intend tocreate and that we don't fully understand. Now the moral and ethicalimplications of deliberately creating another one like you areoverwhelming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs. Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on thisfrequency? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Celebrating? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it have been another hologram? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, move us in closer. This is the Captain. Wewill be pushing the shields to the limit, but we are getting asplendid view of this phenomenon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interesting? You could say that, since he tried to have mekilled, and conspired to strip Worf of his good name. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Intruder alert. Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: His eyes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can any of you suggest any other suspects? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've regained attitude control for the ship, but main power isstill offline. It looks as though the entire power transfer grid hasbeen destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because of Data's wonderful after-dinner conversation. Hisanecdotes are the stuff of legends aboard this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Miss Odell, you were the one who wanted a new home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, all right. Legitimate questions about any of thisneed not be asked apologetically. You feel uncomfortable about aspectsof your duplicate, Data. We feel uncomfortable too, and for no logicalreason. If it feels awkward to be reminded that Data is a machine, justremember that we are merely a different variety of machine. In ourcase, electrochemical in nature. Let's begin to handle this as we woulddo anything else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're certain. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Worf! All of you. Don't respond. Don't provoke themfurther. Keep those weapons down unless you wish to be killed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do we have any record of our current mission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't do that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is verydistracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and weresolve this face to face. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could see a way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We think we've come so far. The torture of heretics, theburning of witches, it's all ancient history. Then, before you canblink an eye, it suddenly threatens to start all over again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds like an illogical philosophy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room one, can you lock onPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Forge? Other opinions? Thank you for your advice.  PICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's how you see it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At your convenience, Mister Data. Please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't thinkit's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf willaccompany you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative, Number One. They're just reacting to our closepursuit. Fall back a bit but stay with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You underestimate her. I know, because I once did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Projection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you cantorture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If someone were to challenge him, the rest of the crew wouldfollow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I saw you crying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Follow him! <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if I don't avoid the fight? What if I won't make thechanges? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying we should give them the samples theyrequire? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what impact will that have on fatal exposure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you hadn't grabbed my sword we'd be back in Sherwood by now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I can assure you that will not go down well atStarfleet Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can you do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Batai? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Congratulations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acting Captain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive the intrusion, Captain, but I need some answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If for any reason you would like to wait a few minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On our way. Picard out. We'll get to the rest of the actanother time, Data. Computer, fileprogramme and clear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, keep us within two hundred kilometres of theEnterprise-C. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen to me, Q. You seem to have some needfor humans. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Divert all power to shields! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, Captain. It's good to meet you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Shut down life support to those decks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Special operations on Celtris Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a pleasure to serve with you, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For what reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you know that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is that object? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. Slow to one third impulse power. Bring us to onezero three mark zero two five. Mister Worf, hail the alien vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm delighted that you're feeling better, Captain. The Admiraland I were worried about you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Now, stay awake. You've got to help me. Ineed your help. All right, now listen. Your patient has lost a greatdeal of blood from multiple lacerations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Academy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you learned? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I would like to have been consulted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Merde. Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quick, into the forest. Mister Worf. That's an order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targetingarray. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lore. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley, because I mustimmediately lock a tractor beam onto the Tsiolkovsky, then tow it outof, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, old friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good, Wesley. Now <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will. How the hell do I advise you? Youknow the implications as well as I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have made a very serious accusation. Iwant you to explain it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets,which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If Iwere to tell them any of this, I would violate that Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How slow? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wasn't. I was a puerile adolescent who allowed himself to beled by his hormones instead of his head. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are some missing pieces to this puzzle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort him to my ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, go ahead, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I suggest that you return to your quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to speak with Ihat. Do you understand? Ihat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the nature of the emergency? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, end programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your escort will with you shortly. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. What is our assignment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Number One, will you and the Counsellor meet our guestsin Transporter room three? And inform Chief O'Brien I will be callingon him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hardly ever recall dreams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Channelling power to the main, er, deflector dish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, it is our obligation to think of escape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Look at those markings. They're very similar to early Taguan designs,but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranianthan Taguan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With fist closed. An army with fist open to lure the enemy. With fist closed to attack? That's how you communicate, isn't it? Byciting example. By metaphor. Uzani's army with fist open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you said yourself that this is only a possibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please. Wait. I have brought you this information because Ithink you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition. Someone whose mind is open to compromise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So am I, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed, we do get an incomplete picture, which is why we alsodo surface reconnaissance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're certainly not an old lady. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into theUniversal Translator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your service honours us. This is my first officer, CommanderWilliam Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not unlike a drumhead trial. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. There's a woman living here. She told me that she'd beento the shuttle. She said that she saw you dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would rather discuss in person, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I know your reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka'stemple. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know whathas got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I willtell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every orderyou're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules ofconduct. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think we could all use a twelve hour layover. Besides, I'vejust received some personnel transfer directives. Priority matter, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good, since we admire what we've seen of your constructiontechniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbaseselsewhere also. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we could <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get off my ship. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will escort a Bajoran Antares class carrier tothe Valo Three camp at oh five hundred hours. Orta and his people willbe aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you any objection? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nine point six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kamala, you are one day away from an arranged mating. Why wouldyou want me to visit you in your quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless withoutrisk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it ifyou'd let me finish my sentences once in a while. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, here's to the class of 'twenty seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Counsellor, how's the boy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on with your briefing, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The attack in which he himself was killed? But why now, aftertwenty years? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're right about this, how did it happen? How did we getthere? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is in no way dangerous? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it something that the shields can't handle? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So how do we cut the puppet's strings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must take care that while he is with us,Commander Kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due thefirst officer of this ship. If he should feel patronised in any way <eos> <bos> PICARD: That'll be all. Number One, a moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. Itis vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling thesenegotiations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, I'll go and get some rest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree with the Counsellor. Amanda deserves to know the truthof her situation. We have no right to withhold such crucial informationfrom her. But it isn't going to be easy telling her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're speaking of yourself, Q, not Guinan. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, do you know what year this is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, I would like to analyse your sensor readings ofthe explosion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, I have no reason to believe that Q islying. He claims he has orders from the Continuum. If Amanda cannotprove that she is fully Q, then he must kill her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, you exceed your own standards of self-preoccupation. Youhave no concern for an officer who may have saved your life. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, the situation sounds so volatile. Perhaps a coolingoff period? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering? Join La Forge down below in Engineering, NumberOne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor Leka has intercepted us before we reach her planet inorder to update us on the situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. This way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind ofprison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that AmbassadorMauric would have any reason to detain us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has Mister Barclay done anything that could be consideredpotentially threatening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Get us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for awoman and child. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to half impulse. I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them on upper and lower band frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't say anything about being thirsty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Both parties are involved, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodnight, my friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, set course for the Kaleb sector, warp factoreight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, we don't have time for that. We've encountered a minormystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Number One,unless there's a major objection, then Ensign McKnight should put usback on course for Evadne Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The probe was launched from Iconia, probably from an automatedsystem. There may be records near the launch site that could help usfind a solution. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your name is Marissa. Is that right? Well, Marissa, I'm goingto need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest and so that makesyou my Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A mischievous spirit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Come in, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid we're going to have to take a look in your vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your motives, but his mother is dead. He mustlearn to live with that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not Gregory Quinn. It may look likehim and sound like him, but it isn't him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, sweep the area. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been examining the dynamics of what used to be called thecon game. Quite fascinating. Worthy of your study, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seal off deck six. Activate security fields sections twentythree through twenty nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It looks harmless enough. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Will you explain thesituation to him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take cover! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, what's happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's that hum? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Hera? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you like to make a statement before we begin? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough. Q, what exactly is going on. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, this is the Enterprise. Come in please. Over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might behere too and we have to find out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every lifeform had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm lookingforward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna! <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind ifwe spoke with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how is it able to move? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, to you, Lal is a new android. But to Data, she's hischild. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A part that she's protecting. You said that everything youencountered when you were in her mind was a barrier of one kind oranother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, but I have to report that our first attempt torestore the moon to its proper orbit has failed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I thought you'd be comfortable here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned,Number One, but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship,then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: if she hadn't lost her rank as a result of that incident atGaron Four, I think she would've made Lieutenant Commander by now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look about you, Sovak. By now it must be obvious, even to you. The Uthat is not here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you spoken with Chief Engineer Argyle about this problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot'sClaw. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they a lifeform? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must trust each other, Tarr. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Medical Lab on main viewer. Let's use this calm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitationalforce of a hundred stars. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, one other thing. Take a look at this. Turned up during anintelligence sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight. That's a sudden yearning for that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thirties? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. Thedoor was open. I hope you don't mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let them knit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's the official record. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Curiosity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll go into that later. Right now I mustspeak to Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I suppose that is the end of Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in less thanfive minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So then you deliberately used Deanna. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That analogy is not exactly <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen anymissile. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I apologise for interrupting yourcelebration, but I'm going to need an away team. Could you report tothe Bridge, please? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you know, that really does look very nice, Mister Mot. Ithink that will be sufficient. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where am I, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this what he's looking for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold course, Mister Crusher. Continual fire, all phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Corey, don't play him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, will you use thesespecifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to have it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I don't believe that the location of the crash andthe proximity of the creature is a coincidence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. Leavethe holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Fine work. We shall miss you, Mister Crusher. As you'veguessed, final entrance examination scores from Starfleet Academy havearrived. Congratulations. As soon as you have completed the oral exam,you'll be formally admitted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, one of the Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. Ineed you to keep them on a tight leash. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know who you are and what you've done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An opportunity to learn from one another. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not deserve it. Look at me. Look at me. Feel the warmth ofmy hand, the rhythm of my pulse. I'm not a supreme being. I'm flesh andblood, like you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, this channel will remain open. Pleasecontinue to report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, at least you got rid of the damn pipe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready tractor beam, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You accused me of being the representative of a barbarousspecies. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, no. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it takes several seconds to materialise. You wouldn't standa chance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Madeline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi. What was that? Over to the left. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a save our skins manoeuvre. We were finished. On fire. We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttlecraft forweeks before we were picked up. I haven't thought about this for years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Captain's log, stardate 47457.1. We have beentrapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Data andCommander La Forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage thecloak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, until we know what'sgoing on I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Harry? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are his chances? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you looking at? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Almost human. With just a bit of a headache. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aceton assimilators? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is Masaka? <eos> <bos> PICARD: what is it you want, Q? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And although Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions,at least Data might listen to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. So once again, thank you for your help. Oh, I will besure to mention your name to Gowron when I speak to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In fact, Penny is waiting for me right now. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: There were hostilities? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the viewer ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any further advice, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excitement? Spending in a damp cave? Chasing after something weshall probably never find? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will not fire on them, Electorine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see I have no choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll talk with the Brekkians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must have triggered something left over from the Erselropewars when the arms business was booming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are not God. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: There. Now, Number One, we need a crew to help us get thathatch off. Don'tyou think that Jay here would make an excellent science officer? Whatdo you say, Jay? Will you join our crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll take that as a yes. You're with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I have rejected your explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it be what's left of the Fleming? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, Ian. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Real. The subject of this meeting is the Jaradan rendezvous. Mister Riker, will you go ahead with the briefing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, I commend your diligence. However, I'm concernedthat you're working yourself too hard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have no intention of compounding what you have done bycommitting another gross violation of the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted toinform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did it work? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our guests will be moving shortly to cargobay four, where the transport will occur. I want you to ensure them ofsafe passage between Ten Forward to the cargo bay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Admiral. It may not be easy for you and I to see her thatway, but he does. And I respect that. They will remain here for now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If our scans and observations confirm the report, of courseI'll approve it. Let's hope it is not too good to be true. Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit of aplanet designated Rubicun Three, the home of a life form who callthemselves the Edo. Our away team, including Wesley Crusher, has beameddown to make arrangements concerning some well-deserved recreation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have made a grave miscalculation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well,thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't really take myselfseriously like this. Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, arethey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, Doctor. Do you have a recommendation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodbye, Captain Okona. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A very old regulation. Well, make it so, Number One. And reducespeed. Drop main shields as well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It comes down to this. We're faced with an enemy who aredetermined to destroy us, and we have no hope of negotiating a peace. Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can tosurvive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How bad is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn it, Geordi, you're going to kill yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humanswore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it was strong, whatever it was. Are you ready, NumberOne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mirasta said it would be a mistake to discuss this with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign, take us out of orbit. Set a course for thePhelan system, warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long until we clearCardassian space? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Just don't point that thing at me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Worf can deal with anything that might arise. How's yourpatient, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starbase three four three. We're to take on medical suppliesfor the Alpha Leonis system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps another time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, this could be some sort of embryo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not satisfactory. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, Iknow what we have to do! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any possible connection with Mister Crusher'sexperiment? Could this warp bubble be floating around the ship perhaps? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is no need to make threats. We each know theconsequences. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any theories? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've already checked those possibilities. The initial findingswould seen to indicate that there was a radiation surge from theRomulan engine core which disrupted the signal. They neverrematerialised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, on the starship Enterprise, no one is alone. No one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, we'd should be getting along to Ten Forward. We'regoing to be late for the concert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive ofyour species? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Number One. We've done all we can to help. Now it's time tomove on. This creature can continue itsexistence without any further interference from us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us back to Ohniaka Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I tend to agree, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree, Ambassador. All of the difficult issues have beenresolved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your preparations made the negotiations simple, Ambassador, andKamala was able to guide me through the rituals. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, thank you for your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay sharp everyone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, you want me to lie? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And in the meantime, I would like to invite you all to join usthis evening on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at MisterData's dreams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was Ensign WesleyCrusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers. Load forward torpedo bays. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a little stiff, but it'll be fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't believe you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want the fleet underway by oh nine hundred tomorrow. Thankyou, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Believe it. I'd been sent to make preliminary overtures to atruce. I'd lowered my shields as a gesture of good will. But theCardassians were not impressed. They had taken out most of my weaponsand damaged the impulse engines before I could regroup and run. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easilyto my people, Gul Macet. You have much to learn about us. BenjaminMaxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him. You know, inwar, he was twice honoured with the Federation's highest citation forcourage and valour. And if he could not find a role for himself inpeace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I, er, what's our ETA? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think he will come? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energy reading? What kind? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Taggert, if she served you as well as you say, why didyou let her go? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There you are, Mister Tarses. Would you care for some lemon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn'tknow what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take thismatter up with Gowron. I'm really sorry that we bothered you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He wants to do something nice for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. We are merely visiting here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And yet you survived. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've failed to get through to you, haven't I? Despite all myefforts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fermat's last theorem. You're familiar with it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, couldn't you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And strength of character. Her loss will bedeeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are we ready, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are asking me to step down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should get some rest. We can talk some more tomorrow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue the hail, Mister Worf. Priority one message. Do youknow what that ship might be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the Krayton. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and you requiremedical attention. Lieutenant Worf, will you accompany SublieutenantSetal to the Sickbay. We will attend to your quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And have you noticed how you and I are now on a first namebasis? Number One, Will, something has happened already. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of thisworld? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Danar, I'm transferring you to Angosian security. They're en route. They will arrive shortly. I wanted to tell you I haveno choice. The Prime Minister insisted and we have no right to refuse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck ten, forward station one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope I've not embarrassed you, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's where they're going through. Send a signal to the fleet. All ships to fall back and rendezvous at Gamma Eridon. We'llre-establish the net there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not fire on defenceless people. Mister Worf open a channelto the Lysians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You areconsidering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,you may lose. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us in a little closer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe we should be getting back to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts. But you see,there were no storm fronts in Kansas that day. Witnesses reported thatthe funnel materialised spontaneously directly over Amanda's home,destroyed it, and disappeared. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may indeed. Those comm. panels are for official shipbusiness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's never seen a bow. It doesn't exist in her world. To you,it's a simple tool. To her, it's magic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Very unlikely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's hard to believe that he could rise to the rank of SenateProconsul without the support of the Romulan traditionalists. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have no choice. Remember, aim low. Fire in short, controlledbursts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My name isn't Mot. It's Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. Eighteen of our people have died. Please, tell usthis is one of your illusions. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, I'm losing manoeuvrability. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rest assured we shall not leave until he is located. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helplesschild? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good evening, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all. I'm here studying the intricacies of Bajoranaqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if you go back, it could be a great deal more helpful. Thewar is going very badly for the Federation, far worse than is generallyknown. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within sixmonths we may have no choice but to surrender. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you will plan on remaining on board for a while. Thereis still much that we need to understand about what has happened toyou. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you destroy this ship, then others will come in search ofus. You may not be able to stop them all. Knowledge of yourcivilisation would be spread across half the galaxy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any readings of matter there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You now request permission to beam down to the planet. Permission granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this. And you should know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them toexecute your son. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A debt? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll take your word for it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. I believe the starship Sutherland will need acaptain. I can think of no one better suited to the task thanyou. DATA <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding. Someone mighthave mistaken this for an actual raid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You made a mistake twelve years ago, but your service sincethen has earned you a great deal of respect, but this incident may costyou some of that respect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I prefer it that way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. The Yridians are information dealers. They mayhave been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send asignal before they were destroyed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like to ask your permission to build something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if it doesn't? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What condition? Can he talk? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing will not beenough. We'll run out of water. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It does to me. I want to know what has happened to Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will gladly share the results of our exploration with all thedelegates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I can barely see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, you always seem to be after my job. Well, as soon asBaran feels that I've outlived my usefulness, he can kill me simply byusing the neural servo. So, I think we had better start planning amutiny. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pressure suit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A lot. Even in orbital space it'll get below minus two hundreddegrees. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reactions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good hunting, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that should not have happened. Captain's log, supplemental. As happened with oursister ship, the Enterprise is being to experience a series of systemfailures. So far they are random, but I fear they could be earlysymptoms of what happened to the Yamato. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your analysis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A few more hours. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, Data, but that takes away none of thewonder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are aspects to Riva of which we have not been informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. Is it a ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A boy. At the same time we were facing destruction, this smallmiracle was taking place. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Commander Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back to full stop, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're relieved of duty, Commander. Mister Worf, confineMister Riker to his quarters. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. We have an environmental system malfunctionon the Bridge. Acknowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chancellor, to instantly transform a society with technologywould be harmful and it would be destructive, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, a word. We have some information you should beaware of. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem you've actually improved upon yourself, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you knowwho I am? No, you don't, do you. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from thecombat area. Half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think we're interested. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reset them, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anyone on Romulus he might know, or choose to contact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Felicitations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reaching up from the planet surface. Amazing power. Data, whatdoes the legend say about the end of the Tkon Empire? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behaviour would seem to suggestwe did not. Why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career ratherthan tell the truth? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vines infect animals in order to kill them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Earth, United States, San Francisco, California. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe the rumours of a secret Romulan base in this sector aretrue. Picard to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Senior Design Engineer of the Theoretical Propulsion Group. Doctor Leah Brahms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Conn report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure that all sciencedepartments have an equal chance of completing their research. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us to warp six as soon as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Quite. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What launching? What's he talking about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is very reminiscent of Dinasian. <eos> <bos> PICARD: jIlajneS. ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj. I accept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From whom? Where is your documentation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't found anything,including peace, which is the only thing I'm looking for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, for God's sake, Walker. This is a secured channel <eos> <bos> PICARD: But these courts happened in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To many people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed you have. And more. This might prove to be an advantageto us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that they could be branches of the same languagefamily, beginning with Iconian? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative. I'll handle this myself. He was an expert incybernetics? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort the Doctor to her quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Somehow I doubt you'd find life aboard a starship suitable toyour taste. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it you really want? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nor can I change who I am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth toinvestigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're ready anytime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's devious, and amoral, and unreliable, and irresponsible,and, and definitely not to be trusted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister Worf. Let's hope we don't haveto use them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you were going to show us something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inform me as soon as it is complete. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. Oh, and will you bring thescan analysis to my quarters when you're off watch? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to come too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, by all means, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: These were not ghosts. what did we see? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what iscausing the temporal anomaly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, tell me. How much time did Data andGraves spend together? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've lost people under my command. People who were very dear tome. But never someone I've been in love with. And when I believed thatyou were dead, I just began to shut down. I didn't want to think orfeel. I was here in my quarters, and the only thing I could focus onwas my music, and how it would never again give me any joy. Then I sawyou standing on the transporter pad and I knew that I could never againput your life in jeopardy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the prognosis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell. He must be quite a man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dead ahead. Impulse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My compliments, Admiral Gromek. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The High Council would seem to agree. They consider the matterclosed. I don't. Mister Worf, the Enterprise crew currently includesrepresentatives from thirteen planets. They each have their individualbeliefs and values and I respect them all. But they have all chosen toserve Starfleet. If anyone cannot perform his or her duty because ofthe demands of their society, they should resign. Do you wish toresign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Barre, France. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe they did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, how were the Argus reactors shutdown? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Precisely what Data recommended, as I recall. At least it gaveCommander Riker the opportunity to consider his promotion. Now thathe's accepted, we can leave him at Starbase Montgomery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'msorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If anything, even worse than we'd heard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's your best area of study? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nobody's perfect, Doctor, butCRUSHER <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your clarity of thought. Your objectivity, as always. Sit down. Data, it's very possible we are about to go to war. The repercussionsof what we do during the next twenty four hours may be felt for yearsto come. I want you to keep a record of these events, so that historywill have the benefit of a dispassionate view. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evasive, Mister Crusher. Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It'll be good to have Counsellor Troi back, won't it, NumberOne? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We know you've been on this ship for some time now, and thatyou're posing as Clara's friend, and that you've been threatening her. We can only assume that there is some connection between yourself andthe life forms attacking this ship. You're obviously an intelligentbeing. There's no reason to hide from us. Talk to us. Or can you onlycommunicate by threatening a small child? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Main Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not possible. You cannot exist outside this room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Nothing lies beneath. I'm really quite dull. I fallasleep each night with an old book in my hands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have considered the possibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker! Thank God. We're leaving. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you believe there is a threat to the Federation in thisstruggle? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we use our sensors to find them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Demons of Air and Darkness, indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, Data, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan warbird, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theFederation vessel Enterprise. You have crossed into the Neutral Zoneand are engaged in hostile action. Explain yourself and your intent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eluded the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, Mister Worf, come in. I particularly want my guest tomeet you. Admiral Satie. This is my Head of Security, Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: New heading. two eight four mark zero one three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons havetaken over the Romulan Empire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard, Captain of this vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I already like his choice in wives. I never thanked youfor your correspondence. It made me feel like part of the family. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you have only a vague intuition <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, we could make use of that. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you amplify the pheromones? They need to be much morepowerful than Deanna's actual scent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it's true, I have been preoccupied. I know that's notvery flattering to you, but I have been thinking about us. And aboutthe choices I've made. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must love her very much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None, Lieutenant. None at all. Captain's log, supplemental. Since the newborn hasattached itself to the hull, it has been making greater and greaterdemands on the ship's energy, but we have been able to stabilise ourpower systems temporarily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. Any reply? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patterson, you're an officer. You have to obey orders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare to increase to warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, escort her to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Have security confine all nonessentialpersonnel to their quarters. Computer, go to Red Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I thinkthat Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze ofglory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the KolvoordStarburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked,you would thrill the assembled guests and Locarno would graduate as aliving legend. Only it didn't work, and Joshua Albert paid the price. Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question. Am I correct? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Move it where? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporterto maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observationwhen they're here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are able to make that determination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you correct the problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There will be no bloodshed. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're not thinking about leaving? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps they're all remembering that old saying. Powercorrupts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were never considered a danger to us, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I offer the hospitality of my vessel. And at your convenience,there is a briefing on the Solari wars. If you wish, I'll have youconducted to your quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we detect this before now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. They might think they don't need as much of theircrew to hold the ship. We could use the element of surprise to give usa tactical advantage. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attention, Ferengi starship. This is Captain Picard. It isobvious that we are in a situation here which needs resolving, and weare willing to do whatever is required, whatever is necessary. I wouldlike, I would request, that you present your terms to us. Captain's log, stardate 41386.5. It is with a heavyheart that I have offered to meet whatever reasonable andnecessary terms are demanded by the Ferengi. I fear for my people andmy vessel in the event the unknown Ferengi ask the unreasonable. Howcan I oppose even unreasonable demands? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are within their rights to demand the removal of thesetrespassers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very impressive design. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operationsince the Academy lab final in exochemistry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter two, prepare to beam the occupant of the scout shipdirectly aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Excalibur. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. We cannot allow them <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't we use Riker? He's a Starfleet Commander. He couldtalk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions. Then when their shields go down, we can beam the artefacts up herewithout ever leaving the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suspect is perhaps too strong a word. I'm simply trying todetermine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For a later discussion. Number One, I think we should get onwith our mission. Starfleet can send a science vessel back toinvestigate further. Move us back out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel. We'll deal with that later. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, there are millions of lives at risk. If you have the powerto Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to worksomething out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, to whom am I speaking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll agree that we should quarantine the Lantree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've not even met him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, will you wait for me in the corridor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Do you read me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Proceed. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Astounding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp factor eight. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Must we destroy them to save ourselves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal andrecently you've been ordering these elaborate things. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you're new on the Enterprise. You'll have to learn toexpect the unexpected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're coming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what do you hope to accomplish? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The intelligence that was formed on the Enterprise didn't justcome out of the ship's systems. It came from us. From our missionrecords, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. Now, if ourexperiences with the Enterprise have been honourable, can't we trustthat the sum of those experiences will be the same? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

We cannot afford this continuing distraction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir, it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You tell me. Are you strong enough to refuse to use that power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Geordi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All we have here are questions. Mister Data, continue with yourscan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you have about equal physical strength and mental abilities? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take us out of orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: DATA, lock on to the Yamato with a tractor beam. We leavetogether. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I, er, I assumed because of the way you welcomed me the otherday. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She knows exactly what she's doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh no, I don't want that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep her under guard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that she was aboard the Enterprise C whenit was destroyed twenty four years ago, that she was one of thesurvivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between herand a Romulan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said modern rite. How was the ritual performed in the past? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassianterritory and some Cardassian colonies in ours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From the moment I met you, I knew you were going to be trouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, the leading scientist of Kaelon Two and <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's one now. Sakkath knows. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, we no longer have a choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why Istarted to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The pity is that I had to be impaled through the back before Ilearned that lesson. I started that fight with those Nausicaans. Istarted it because, because I was young and cocky. If I'd been moreresponsible in those days, I wouldn't have needed this heart, and Iwouldn't have died from a random energy surge thirty years later. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: As a result, we won't be able to rendezvouswith the Kearsarge for another four days. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how do you account for it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's your signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How about a war? If generations of conflict is killingmillions, do we interfere? Ah, well, now we're all a little less securein our moral certitude. And what if it's not just killings. If anoppressive government is enslaving millions? You see, the PrimeDirective has many different functions, not the least of which is toprotect us. To prevent us from allowing our emotions to overwhelm ourjudgement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you each know the officers you inhabit, then you knowthey're equally ready to give their lives for this ship. Free them now and I will return you to the moon's surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chart it. I want to see if there's a pattern. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nor would I, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Feels like that right now. Good. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in theDemilitarised Zone any more than your government would condone theparamilitary actions of Cardassian civilians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Needless to say, I've not succeeded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it you want? We mean you no harm. Do you understand me? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is unusual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rex's bar? Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They wanted us to leave Rana and that's exactly what we'redoing. Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Use Science Station two, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened, Deanna? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is it coming from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Gowron. This is an unexpected pleasure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You understand the difficult position in which I'm placed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggeststhat the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want toescalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've beentracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It'slike following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here andstopped, which is what I knew would interest you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They captured me to find out how much I knew about theiroperation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard aboard the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Please do us the honour of visiting our vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you remove it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's because <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, you stay at your post. If this is the result ofa Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The thought had occurred. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They wouldn't intentionally hide it or make it difficult for usto find. It must be right in front of our faces. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Durasfrom the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to theRomulan-Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action, but we will bein a position to expose any Romulan supplies that attempt to cross theborder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why would you not bring something so important to the attentionof your own people or the Federation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Release him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In this situation, Prime Directive prohibits me from helpingyou. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lantree. Are you under attack? Lantree? Lantree, this isthe Enterprise. Come in, Lantree. Replay that last transmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, you did more than your job. You enjoyed it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Is it another holographic device? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't dance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want from me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirtyseven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been looking forward gagh. Haven't had it for quite awhile. Very fresh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Dirgo, I think it would be wiser <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, Doctor Brahms, congratulations. You've weanedthe baby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We haven't found a way to transport you back yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Link established. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attention on deck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out ofhere? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Korris and the other Klingon are dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to stop it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the matter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's keep in mind that that particular danger was invented byQ. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? I'll be glad to do when I'm free. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps a different level of consciousness? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, return to the ship immediately. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you learned? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's modifying the emitter diode to project something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any problems? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. I assume you know what it's about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You too, Doctor. I have business with the Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's hold this position for a while, Number One. This is worthstudying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, and one piece of good news.. We're to rendezvous with ashuttlecraft carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from theAcademy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Data. Give me some background. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need a new captain and I've come to one inescapableconclusion <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sound familiar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all threedifferent time periods? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need someone to read a part. You're just in time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Tholl! <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularlygood subject. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. Do you know where you are? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I think that you should consider analysing yournew guidance system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me. Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Boreth is only twelve days from here by shuttle. As of thismoment, Mister Worf, you are on leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything. Everything. I'll be in my Ready room if I'm needed. That will be all for now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inform the Bridge. Mister Data, with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And respects. Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The one that leads to total annihilation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two days ago, you were so upset about the Borg even being onthe ship that you tore my foil out of my hand. And now you're herequestioning whether it should be treated as the enemy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then let's start at the beginning. The first entry seems to bestardate 30620.1. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I doubt the warp bubble could alter computer records, or erasememories. Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's our only workingtheory for now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? Idon't see that those would be any more effective. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create somevery challenging climbs. We could go down together and I could show youhow to use theprogramme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be back before Jimmy Cuzzo arrives. I guarantee it will betaken care of. Just relax. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you care to be shown to your quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You, sir, you will explain your error and apologise, and praythat we can negotiate a peace we can all live with. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me try to understand. You're saying that Commander Data issuffering from a profound loss of confidence, and that you believe onlyI can restore the balance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer. Store programme Picard delta onein active memory and discontinue simulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the Cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's been in direct contact with the boy for eighteen minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I never said there was a prospect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In private and off the record. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, it's all your fault. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. We'll begin transporting the survivors on board immediately. Bridge out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe accessthrough this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what's their condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, prepare to beam our guests and their cargo down toOrnara. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like to see her now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaultingprisoners is hardly a fair trial. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I wish, I wish time would have allowed me to knowyou better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before we regain attitude control? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, I wanted to see how you were and have a look at yourbaby! My goodness. How old is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What help? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much longer will it be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Method acting? I'm vaguely familiar with it, but why would youchoose such an old-fashioned approach? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, Mister Data, I am aware of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No ID, no answer to our signals. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon will you be ready to leave Acamar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far tooimportant to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't have to remind us of our duty. You just rememberyours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You say that with remarkable assuredness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Under the circumstances, I thought that it would help if Ilearned more about you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them ifthey have any wounded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ship's status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you Captain Riker is quite well. He's looking forwardto attending the final negotiations as planned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Five to beam up. Energise. First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I amreturning the conn to Captain Picard as we begin loading the vaccinesupply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal mission complete. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, that's the second of your criteria. Let's deal with thefirst, intelligence. Is Commander Data intelligent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Using the information we found in your escape pod, we maybe able to return you to your people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From your Starfleet records. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I should contact the Enterprise, have them meet us atVulcan just in case these isolationists try to escape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any communication, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi, will you report to the guest lounge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take theRomulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How's your search coming? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I call to the stand Commander Bruce Maddox as a hostilewitness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you must be my uncle Rene. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the Romulans would have a legitimate excuse for respondingin force. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Riker. it's good to see you have recovered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're on our way, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, now that we've established our mutual good will, what'son your mind? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're going to be with us for a while. Let's find out all wecan about them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vash, damn it, it's me! <eos> <bos> PICARD: The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're mistaken. I am ready and willing to discuss theestablishment of full diplomatic relations under the same terms asAmbassador T'Pel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you and Mister Data report to the Bridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse power, full impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need more time. Mister Data, prepare the colonists for anevacuation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am open tosuggestions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I believe what happened on the Horatio wassabotage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One quarter impulse, engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut that off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems to work well for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some kind of reaction to our phaser fire, perhaps. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have a theory as to the cause? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are transporting you directly to thedetention cell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Perrin? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, Counsellor, Doctor. John, I want you to joinus. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. Mister Worf stay at Tactical. Counter any moves the Zalkonian makes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admit what, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they collaborators? Did they providethe colony's assailants with something that abetted the totaldestruction of Rana Four in order to protect their own lives? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you find? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not the point. It would be It would beinappropriate for you to carry out the procedure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Garadius system. Warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you and your husband be staying with the ship, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski. We will handle the formalintroduction later. Counsellor Deanna Troi is pregnant. She is going tohave a baby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that now would be quite nice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressiveaccomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With its Lang-cycle fusion engines still intact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look after me? You? You were a bully. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship waslooking for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok. We would like you to beour guest here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inexcusable. And understandable. It may be that what you arelooking for cannot be found here on the Enterprise. Perhaps you need toimmerse yourself in Klingon beliefs in order to discover whether theycan hold any truths for you. Is there something you can do, is theresomewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, yes. It's, er, it's for the children. I'm, er, ha, ha,I'm a role model. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, three to transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Moving? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't worry, I won't move. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let me see. Your science project involved radishes, didit not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly! Arranged marriages have been the basis of politicalalliances in many cultures, including our own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. Where are we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or interfere in any way until I arrive. Picard out. Number One, have Security moving that way but tell them tokeep their distance. You have the Bridge. Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Greg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which goes <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are any of these systems near Romulan space? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At that speed, Mister La Forge, there won'tbe a ship left to reach the Pelloris Field. Do what you have to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jason. Your being here? I hope it will give us the chance toget to know each other. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, respond at once! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, you can pull it away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Enterprise. We are moving to intercept twoCardassian warships. Maintain your present course and speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had hoped to find that out from you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he still alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Sickbay would be a better idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: 47988. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are you feeling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it's not important. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Jared. As I've tried to tell you, you saved your own livesa long time ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the first thing you've said I do understand. I'll see whatI can do. And, please, stay off the comm. panels. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, please, let's try and resolve this matter. CaptainKushell, what crime has Okona allegedly committed against you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have battery backup? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we have a problem, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it would be better if you stayed on board theEnterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, I see. You, too, understand the proper value of women. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of therenearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, bring Doctor Stubbs to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stabilise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, prepare to return to the shuttlebay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf's question is valid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, come in. Transporter Room, this is the Captain. Weare out of contact with the away team. Beam them back immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And so the upshot is that we'll be close enough for you to slipaway for a few days and see Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have takenus to the brink of war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It goes far beyond friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am not being unreasonable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, is the Ferengi Goss still on board the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up acommand post and begin mapping out a search plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Geordi, I understand how much we want, even need, toexplain an accident like this. Sometimes there just aren't anyexplanations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, try to make some sense out of this mess. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Begin as soon as you're ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, Commander Data has informed me of your situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, pleasego to Lieutenant Yar and take her down to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on ahypothesis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need tointroduce them to anyone new. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until he does something more menacing, I see no reason why weshould prevent him from continuing his work. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, the success of this mission would be far morelikely if we could get our memories back. Is there anything you can do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to Red Alert. Shields to maximum. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The pleasure of your company is requested,Counsellor. We're having a little impromptu reception for the arrivingdelegates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat said that someone named Korgano isn't chasing Masakaanymore. And the old man said, he pursues her no longer. In a sense,this small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka. <eos> <bos> PICARD: According to Baran's logs, we are todeliver the two pieces to the T'Karath Sanctuary on Vulcan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced thepassage of time while you were stored in the computer memory. I canassure you, we had no idea that that would be the case. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, youare allowed a complementof forty, so select whom youwill, save of course Mister Data,who will serve as myfirst officer during yourabsence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's my weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting quitecaught up in this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much longer till we can access their logs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I prefer to look on the future as something which is notwritten in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was my answer, computer? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. Go to Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have confirmed that Data's discovery islife. But more than that, it is intelligent life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise responded, and found the warbird suffering froman apparent engine failure, and they attempted a power transfer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert until further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we don't regain control, then no oneelse must have it either. Now, this is the one decision involving theoperation of this vessel which requires you and I to be in totalagreement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come cheer up my lads, 'Tis to glory we steer. To findsomething new in this wonderful year. To honour we call you as free menand brave. For who are so free as the sons of the waves? Hearts of Oakare our ships, Jolly tars are our men. We always are ready. Steady,boys, steady. We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me try to explain. I am by no means embarrassed by yourpresence here. On the contrary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. But what would the Breen be doing inside theBlack Cluster? The boy described a boarding party with helmets andphaser rifles. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Consider it Captain's privilege. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is Captain Picard. Return all command functionsto the stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was here to protect the peace. A peace that I firmly believeis in the interests of both our peoples. If I had attempted to boardthat ship I am quite certain that you and I would not be having thispleasant conversation, and that ships on both sides would now be armingfor war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't thank me. Sobi and Langor, they decided to let you haveit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're blocking her sensitivity. They're stopping her fromseeing the truth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My mind is barely working. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, are we in firing range? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My only regret is that your reunion marks Will's farewell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I understand the predicament you were in. It could nothave been an easy choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Those devices are part of a system located down here. Anotherone is about to be released. Watch yourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are its weapons systems active? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Advise him that we will transport sown to thesurface immediately. Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication of a more conciliatory attitude ontheir part? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you recommend that we proceed? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: After they died? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of theEnterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you. Starfleet hasclassified the Cor Caroli Five plague as secret. No cadet would haveknowledge of that incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate that. Computer, resume. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even if these weapons are genuine, I can assure you that athird party must have been involved. The Federation is not in thebusiness of supplying arms to rebels. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: But. Damn it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you ease the pain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, I am singularly impressed by your concern for alife. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picardout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Number One, put a technical team together. Let's get these repairs underway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you ever consider applying to the Academy, going the wholeroute, apply to become an officer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare for a mission Iknow nothing about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I order you to return to duty at once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take evasive action. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scotsyourself. What was it that drew you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, tell me, is theprogrammestill running? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait. Wait. That's not possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, this seems to be a situation more suited to yourtalents. I'll leave it with you. I'll be on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attempt to make contact, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know where we can find Orta? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, hail the Romulan vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and thethreats are mounting. We need Odan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But everything started when we found the Brittain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return that moon to its orbit. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Voval. Voval, try not to move. You may have a concussion. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise, do you read me? Too muchinterference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've injected me with drugs. Surely you must realise thatI've already answered truthfully every question you've put to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I mean no disrespect, but we are faced with an alarmingsituation <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, any explanation for this injector problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is he saying, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we beam down an away team through one of those holes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If so, the question becomes how will they use that knowledge? Data, do you have any information touching this on any file? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And then, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They don't have to answer. They just have to listen. Sheliakvessel, you will have to get past me to get at the colony on Tau CygnaFive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can't you enhance the frequency? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, he's becoming a very fine officer. He works as hard asany member of the crew. Riker says his studies are on line. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why discount the possibility that it's responsible for thesecomas? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is your designation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we get the shuttles close enough without danger? Mister LaForge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me when I say that we do notknow how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need toknow it now. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, once I have regained voice command, I will transport youfrom the holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought it would make you feel better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about his mother? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand you've been discussing alternative adversarialengagement strategy with Mister Mot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: After the shields fall, how long before fatal exposure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is enough, Ensign. When addressing a senior officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate that, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's really quite exciting, actually, if you understand thepotential of exploring a new world on our own planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet. Eventually you wear it out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Absolutely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you're continuing his work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. I'll try. But I want you to know this is mutiny. Now, Number One, look at that control panel. Now, the yellow controlpad, hit that once. Now the one below it, hit twice. Now that shouldrelease the panel underneath. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek, those people are Federation citizens and I am swornto protect them. If your troops attack that village, my security forceswill respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were gettingalong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Probable impact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Constitution class. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are finished, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. We proceed with the plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. Youare not to enter Federation space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shuttle occupant, identify yourself. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: But in forty years, they've never attacked a Federation target. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To find some privacy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've got to find some way to stop this system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate full check, all systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So. Five card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Mister La Forge indicated that this was not anentirely routine mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. That's better. Now, if we're to accomplish anything <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher what was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put yourself in her place. You see, she cannot kill a hornbuckat a great distance. You can. You have a power she lacks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You picked a wonderful locale. This is something I might havechosen myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly what kind of historian are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you speak to it? Does it speak to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: To expose a child to this. To someone who is suffering. To seethat it is you that inflict that suffering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? What instrument? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may berelevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my ChiefSecurity Officer. His presence is required. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy beingexpended. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have much time. He's getting more control of hisenvironment. Let's see if we can't beat Professor Moriarty by givinghim everything he wants. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we lost you in mid-transport. Where'veyou been? What is going on down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to see that contract. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps we should forget about what happened and try to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, everyone . Ensign, put us back on course for theMoselina system. Warp four as soon as we're clear of the debris field. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. He must not be lost. He's not simply an android. He's alife form, entirely unique. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest we do? JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it come, let it come. Activate the main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may never reach that point. A variation of what happened tothe Yamato might destroy us first. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put there to protect the water. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhapsyou and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that cando all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Addictive? What have you discovered? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A parade? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll let my Medical Officer handle it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, I have the utmost confidence in your ability toperform the impossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your staff is all well, I presume, Director? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can't you just turn on the kid's computer in schoolroomeight? We just want to play a few games. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that a problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Captain Riker. The Romulan Ambassador is readyto transport over from the Decius. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Marie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, get us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have nothing to say to you, and I will resist you with mylast ounce of strength. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of the aims of the exchange programme, Commander, is forall of us to learn tolerance. As for my crew, it may be healthy toshake up the status quo occasionally. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you just ask for our help? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understandable, given this particular life form's novel nature. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not have you telling me what courseto set. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've never heard of anyone that didn't love a good mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodnight. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From your knowledge of the man, what has gone wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it to the wall, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're on our way, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, whenever you're ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This is my associate Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we can't delay any longer. Ready the tractor beam,Lieutenant Yar. Target the ship. Activate on my command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on alldecks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucersection, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You knew what you had to do. I just made sure you listened toyourself. Goodbye, Cadet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you reverse the process? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do they know of our Prime Directive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will. Look, I'm sorry, I cannot help you to make this decision, but I can tell you this. Klingons choose their friends with great care. If he didn't know he could count on you, he never would have asked. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood, Commander. Keep us informed of your efforts. Picardout. I'll be in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you resist? We only wish to raise quality of life forall species. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I wish you and your people well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seemsreasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have little choice. Whatever has him is interrupting thetransporter beam. Remove it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arrange to feed it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thanks, Number One. He's my number one Dad. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, we have made some progress here. Let's not ruin thatwith unnecessary posturing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not every man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've given away their humanity with this geneticmanipulation. Many of the qualities that they breed out, theuncertainty, the self-discovery, the unknown, those are many of thequalities that make life worth living. Well, at least to me. I wouldn't want to live knowing that my future was written, that myboundaries had been already set, would you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Enterprise. Well, now that we're under way, I cantell you about our mission. Starfleet Intelligence believes theCardassians are developing a metagenic weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm asking that you keep an eye on your son during all of this,Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm feeling very much better. in fact, I don't intend to go onusing this any longer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pass my congratulations to the rest of your team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're here, the entire crew must know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By doing what? When? How can <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impressions, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And punish us as well, it would seem. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you see what is happening here, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what's going on? We've lost primary helm control on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. You should proceed with your mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The honour is ours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand down from red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, if I could explain this I would. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand that you've relieved Doctor Russell of duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That area was colonized fairly recently, as I recall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is my responsibility to protect the lives of Federationcitizens. I will not permit this abduction to succeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, download the inventory and cross-reference it withthe medical computer. Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealttransported up. Captain's log, supplemental. Although it's beenfourteen hours since we arrived at'audet Nine. Hester Dealt has still not completed inspection of thecontainment unit. A transfer will not be permitted until he's assuredof zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas fromthe Rachelis System continue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Terrorist carrier? Are you certain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cattle, chickens, pigs. Not DNA, the actual livestock. Incredible. Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doesn't sound too serious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to check the status of the warp core. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If Deanna dies, and he breaks the link with her, then he willchoose someone else, possibly someone from his own delegation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Command considers Graves' work on molecularcybernetics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priorityone action. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And whom did you inform? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And another William Riker materialised there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What you have done will have seriousramifications. I am truly dismayed that you toldno one of what you were doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long until we reach transporter range? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Against your keeping out of humanity's path for ever. Done? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <eos> <bos> PICARD: Omicron omicron alpha yellow daystar two seven. Enable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would be the prudent move. I never thought I'd hear myselfsaying something like that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems, DoctorPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish tospeak with Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened over there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open frequency, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Okay, Bev. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before we can return to warp power? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been in touch with Admiral Hahn at Starfleet Academy. TheAdmiral regrets your missing the oral examination but hopes that you'llreapply next year. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inexcusable. You defied the orders of theranking officer on the scene. You put the lives of the entire away teamin jeopardy, and you made an already tense situation worse. Youractions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform. Now, Iwant an explanation, Mister Crusher, and I want it now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am sorry we couldn't save your ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The interval between radiation bursts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happening, Mister La Forge? We're losing speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Contact DS9. Find out what they know about this Yridian trader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion. Warpeight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. You are a certified pilot, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He cried. I saw that. I couldn't believe it. A Vulcan moved totears by music? It's <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, will you wait outside? Have a seat, Admiral Jarok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral. There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still, there was a considerable loss of life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Borg ship will enter orbit in one hour. You'll soon be headed home. We'll beam him down and then we'll take upa position in the star's chromosphere. The interference will hide usfrom their sensors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep trying them. Communications are bound to be erratic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may speak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'll think about it and let you know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not going to hurt you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to capture it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something about your location is interfering withcommunication. We are working on the problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what's the cause of my headache? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try and take us out of here. Maximum warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds like someone who hated life. Yet he had himselffrozen presumably so he could go through it all again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm not dressedproperly. I'll be back.  LEECH <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My away team is unable to leave the surface because of thestorms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we will leave them be. I'll order warning beacons placedin orbit and on the surface. Hopefully, no one else will have to gothrough what you did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're our guests, Mister Worf. I don't want them to feel likeprisoners. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, will you go to Ten forward and keep an eye onData? Don't interfere with his actions unless you hear otherwise fromme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, we don't know where the escape pod is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have found our Titania. Don'tyou agree? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's it. Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have we any idea what came through the rupture before we wereable to shut it down? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He recognises your interest in profit. Or is that an incorrectassumption? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come and have supper tonight, my friend. I'll make somevegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp nine point three. How much time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we don't know what's causing the disease. We can't protectourselves against the unknown. What we need is some kind of filter thatdoesn't depend on known biological factors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deceive them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain T'Jon, we are unable to attach our tractor beam becauseof the intense solar activity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Small talk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll have to be a little more precise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here too. I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor. I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you don't release the hostages, I won't cooperate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported onboard at Farpoint Station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have nothing to prove anything here, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identifying marks, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you learned, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You come in search of what humanity is! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before the power drain becomescritical, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you havebrought my ship and my crew into great risk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You didn't do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference willhave to be postponed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want alook around? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get off my bridge! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, really? Not as a wedding present for Sir Guy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fatalities? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Force field down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Never mind the details. Can you remove it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have been wrestling with that problem too, unfortunatelywithout any success. But we have turned our findings over toStarfleet's most experienced theoretical scientists. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to say. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Escort Chancellor Durken to the transporter room, Lieutenant. And assign quarters to Minister Yale. She will be remaining on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Riker. We're alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroy it. At any cost. When I was on the Stargazer, weconducted extensive tests using theta band carrier waves. One of thereasons I was selected for this mission is my familiarity with themethods used for generating them. Mister Worf, your presence here isobvious. Doctor, your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxinswe may find. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if we lose the force field for any reason, we lose theship. Force fields can fail, and until <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, my first and foremost consideration will be toensure the safety of this ship and its crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energyusage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much longer until we clear the rift? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then Masaka is your queen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we have them securely, Lieutenant? Can they beam out to theplanet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get me a full report from Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, not a matter of great moment, just a knot I had to untie. So, what do you want to see me about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand that he requested the Enterprise specifically. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand your concern, NumberOne. They're not authorised to make any alterations in our engines, andaccording to Starfleet's report, they will simply test different waysof entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harmin that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting there was a Romulan accomplice in closeproximity to La Forge when he was receiving the signals? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How widespread is this movement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Lieutenant. Shields up. No one is going toharm you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you see no evidence of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For as long as we can hold it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Orders which we can't even verify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have they crossed the border? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Identify yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beam us directly to the Enterprise Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still feel that youwant to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your conditiongood? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds delightful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, shut down all computer access to Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the original coordinates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here andface me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you herebecause I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume this is a simulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet, you see we are doing everything in our power toreach the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, I think that we should just forget about this and enjoyout evening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm surprised that you let her come in here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A few hours on board and already she's found Ten forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going tobreach. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So if Palmer, in his delirium, fled into a cave, we may beunable to detect his life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sickbay. Not good is a galactic understatement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've done well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tryla Scott. It's said you made Captain faster than anyone inStarfleet history, present company included. Are you that good? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're going to assume the Yamato's mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan, how much more can you tell us aboutthese creatures? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Respond on the same frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor from thefuture who left behind a mysterious device known as the Tox Uthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have to like her, Will, but we have to follow herorders, and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves nopurpose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can believe what you wish. We will be on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine, Mister Data. Proceed. Well, Mister Worf, let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man. Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data hassucceeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher hasdetermined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay'sUrodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees tostarboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you make of this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We believe that they were trying to extract strategicinformation from your memory using a neurosomatic technique. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain position! Mister La <eos> <bos> PICARD: I doubt there are many oak trees on Tagus. No, I think this issupposed to be Earth, somewhere round about the twelfth century. Andthis is England, or to be more precise, Sherwood Forest. Or at leastQ's recreation of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of vessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough of this. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: This wouldn't quench your thirst, it would make it worse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What caused the rage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wideexperience in inter-species contact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, find a way to defeat that shield. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long have you been on Caldos? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain on board theEnterprise until this investigation is complete. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leaving so soon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Personal log, Commander William Riker. Stardate41153.7. The Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station, where Iawait the arrival of the new USS Enterprise to which I have beenassigned as First Officer. Meanwhile I have been asked to visit theFarpoint Administrator's Office, in the old city. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would appear so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your warning, Prime Minister. We will keep youinformed of our progress. <eos> <bos> PICARD: More like dying, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin monitoring Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone,Mister Data. Have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wake him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Someone that tense could be very unpredictable. Stay on yourtoes, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, I think you were right after all. I think I did comeback so that you could help me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's Earth. It's home. Do I need another reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You had a hand in helping me get out of this. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely, to present yourself in this condition is not goingto help our cause. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take itto Science Station four oh two in the Kohlan system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn. Sorry, Number One, what was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not low enough to beam them out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am taking it as such. Counsellor. You have the Bridge, NumberOne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should read more history, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are no technologically advanced cultures in that systemnow. But perhaps eighty seven million years ago, there were. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good, because our survival depends upon it. I am ordering younever to reveal what has happened here today. Not to Starfleet, not tomyself. You will conceal your knowledge of the Paxans for as long asyou exist. Do you fully understood, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception? The violence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Never had the time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have completely recovered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are these? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here's what I propose. You can't stay onthe Enterprise, but I have arranged for us to rendezvous with the USSCharleston, bound for Earth. They will deliver you there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Simply speaking, we don't trust you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've been waiting a long time for this. They're not going totake any risks. Now, take one of the artefacts and beam down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's a lava tube beyond here that runs for seventy fivemetres, then it connects with another chamber. We need to get throughhere. This tube opens up beyond this crack. We could widen the opening,then we should be able to crawl through. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Triolic waves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you been able to determine why he's still unconscious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would a delay of one hour affect your plans? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, will you hailCaptain Maxwell? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right, now come on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't listen to him, Gloria. He's lying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. Iasked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance toredeem yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. How soon can you have the link ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have some brandytogether. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. Riva negotiated several treaties between the Klingons andthe Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Thank you. First Officer's log, supplemental. I am sending ashuttlecraft to find Captain Picard, gambling that the Tamarians willsit tight rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, I've been smuggling artefacts from Federation sites foryears. You can't help developing a familiarity with certain Starfleetpersonnel. If we hadn't have captured him, he'd probably have ended upbefore a court martial. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Commander. Please, come in. Sit down. I find myself havinggrave concerns about our mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that what you're doing here? Trying to recapture thosefeelings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't believe Ardra is capable of transporting the Enterprisea light year away. Keep hailing them, Mister Data. Repeat on allfrequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there myresponsibility ends, but you, you have to stay with them through theentire grieving process. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Changing course. Heading zero seven three, mark two eighteight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can assure you that I'm not given to casual relationships. There is something that I want to tell you. But nothere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that an order, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well good luck, Mister. Good luck, Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me hear it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Successful? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. Youare in Federation territory. Please explain your presence here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I appreciate your time constraints, but recognising newlife, whatever its form, is the principal mission of this vessel. Please. Now, Mister Data, will you tell us what makes you think thatthe exocomps are alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In good time, Duras. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, I may not have your gifts at reading emotions, Counsellor,but I can tell when someone is in pain and hiding it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have security evacuate all personnel from thosedecks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do havesomething in common. We all react differently to authority. You, thecollaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, rejectauthority in any form. I, a Starfleet Captain, trained to command. Andyou, a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority. Our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us toovercome. They give us food which Esoqq can't eat, to make him athreat. They give us a door we can't open until the four of usco-operate. And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses to set usagainst each other again, while you observe our reactions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Their priorities seem to have changed. Open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him. Where would we find him other than on the floor of the Romulan Senate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it emitting any signals, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone willknow very shortly. Carry out my orders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, I'm sorry, Geordi. I'm not prepared to risk your life. Data, find another way of salvaging the Raman. I want an alternate planin two hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be returning shortly, Commander. Inthe interim, stand ready to initiate transporter code fourteen at mysignal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Must be rewarding to you to repay others for all those years ofmisery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened to them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment backhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're trying to determine what happened right now, and if thereis anything you can remember that may assist <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Can you hear me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're increasing to warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume that you must be Lieutenant Commander Daren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I see you gifts have been well received. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are we losing our professional detachment, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation formore than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until wehave more evidence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end. Stay awake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You always did have a flair for the dramatic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But whatever circumstances you encountered, why didn't younotify Starfleet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been detected near oneof our border posts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you won't be late for your exams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by anothercaptive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a great pity you began by abducting my Security Officer,Lutan, because I should tell you I do admire the hospitality you offerhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now you propose to dismantle him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We would be more than willing to extend our visit, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, why not? We're talking about a threat to the entire futureof the Federation. I don't think any of us can rest easy until we'vebeen to the source. Captain's personal log, supplemental. While it isquite unusual for a starship to return to Earth, we seem to be leftwith no other choice. I have apprised the remaining bridge crew of oursituation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The reason is obvious, of course. What are the Ferengi up to? Stand by, Enterprise. Stand by for what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: One more ship will make no difference in the here and now. Buttwenty two years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before itstarted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There she is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, I have no doubt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, you are a member of this crew, and you will not gointo hiding whenever a Klingon ship uncloaks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How's our mediator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I haven't spoken to you before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sickbay, this is the captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I can only assure you that I will deal with any challengeaccording to Klingon law. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's have a look. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland, you are not going to die out there. You aregoing to do exactly what I tell you. Now, take the nose of theshuttlecraft and aim it directly at Relva Seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data, that is a natural assumption. Engineering? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Neither was I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But, Command? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own toinvestigate this Tin Man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you addressing me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll give it serious thought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The situation is under control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I ask, Ambassador, what has this to do with us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But by your own admission, Reyga was a difficult man tounderstand. Isn't it possible that he was simply masking his feelings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's all right. Er, allow me to introduce you. This isBeverly, Doctor Beverly, Doctor Beverly Crusher. This is Vash. She's afriend of mine from the Archaeology Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was the other choice? We can't fight, we can't escape, wecan't go forward. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Mister Worf. Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not going to work, Nagilum. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just happens. Whatis that smell? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, isn't it just a matter of time? I know how difficultit was for you being away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Premier, with all due respect <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't afford to take it easy, Doctor. Tell me,where is Lieutenant Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arrivingat the truth. Well, I hope you've learned a little wisdom along theway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Relay those coordinates to the transporter room. I'mbeaming down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get him up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The facts are here. At least show them to someone who willrecognise what they mean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has his been changed as well? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope your journey aboard the Merrimacwill be uneventful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, he's certainly not what I would expect. Without cause orreason, he and his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship! <eos> <bos> PICARD: My help? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you can at least help us locate our people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can hardly believe this will convince anyone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But can they be removed from the hull? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Number One. Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what about when there are no others, when you are alone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of theidentification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person toanalyse these artefacts. Baran knows that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if you're right, someone else may be involved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's make this transfer with alldeliberate speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Evek assured me that they had stopped that practice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, hard starboard! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we have an onboard communications system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm glad you could join us, Mister Barclay. Your report, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mister Data,what kind of cake is this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to talk to a friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign Gates? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forget it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inform him we're on our way. Thank you forbreakfast. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now look, this is a simple ceremonial greeting, nothing more. All right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will not serve you here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And look what we've done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How far are we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I want security teams along the main passagewaysand in every transporterroom. And see if the computer would be good enough to give you theprecise stun setting to disable Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We question whether this court is abiding by its own trialinstructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat therecord? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: To what end? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know what happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well then, I've saved you the bother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, by this time tomorrow we could be back on the Enterpriseand you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife andfork. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about thecrew. How are they reacting to our sudden change in course? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm convinced that Q isn't telling us everything. See what youcan find out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, please report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the Enterprise at risk? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to half impulse power. Will you join me in theObservation lounge when you're done? <eos> <bos> PICARD: From the surface? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counselor Troi understands him better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would rather die as the man I was than live the life I justsaw. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, Ambassador. But I also realise the potentialbenefits. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin your calculations, Mister Data. We'll go as soon asyou're ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is one of those times when we must face the ramificationsof the Prime Directive and honour those lives which we cannot save. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, put us back on course. Warp three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm the Captain of the ship. What is it you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, continue your scan. Ensign, link navigationalcontrol to Mister Data's console and plot a course for that distortion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we don't have time for that now. Mister Worf, send amessage to the nearest starbase. Ask them to dispatch a crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? What would never work? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only place we can stop this is on the Bridge. Let's go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we are having similar difficulties reading you. I amadvising you and your away teamPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen! On screen! Let's see it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: When did they leave? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is our procedure, Ensign, to notify command of anypossibility of danger to the ship. The decision is not yours. Do youunderstand? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No less so for me. But I promised cooperation, and that's whatwe shall give. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea what it was? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I never wanted to become <eos> <bos> PICARD: Especially under these circumstances. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not convinced that you are fully Q. And they are alsoresponsible for your parent's death. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, I don't regret anything that happened last night. I hopeyou don't either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Allow us to help Mister Whalen, and we will returnwith the item. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wes, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, advise the Astral Five annex. This should becatalogued and scheduled for retrieval. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. Youmentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, please! Let me remind you he is innocent until he isproved guilty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or could he be lying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll remain here. It's safer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wasn't aware that he had. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the Ambassador is not well. Will you please attend tohim in his quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you to analyse our sensor readings of theBorg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or analien ship which they captured. Then run an analysis of this subspacedistortion they used to escape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do they mean to carry out their threat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Send it directly to the aft section of the Raman through thesecondary air lock. That way it should put it just one bulkhead awayfrom the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussionsto the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'mhere as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I met the new head of Stellar Sciences last night. LieutenantCommander Daren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can we be sure we can get them out of you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There goes the other shoe. They know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but what does it all mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Small animals, no, but horses. Computer, programme the holodeckfor a woodland setting, with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My superintendent was a Betazoid, a full telepath. When he sentfor you to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meet me in Transporter room two. We're going down to thesurface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to manual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, let's get some sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. And please add that if he is unable to provide a ship,then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would bewilling to help me. And then, they would have our gratitude. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, this is the Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel Red alert. Mister Worf, adjust the sensors to compensatefor the distortion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not happening. It's not enough. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister La Forge. What kind of place is this, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A gateway? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the IrumodicSyndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's notthat. And I'm not daydreaming either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A defection? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know the story from Vulcan mythology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have the necessary tools to realign the coil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vulcan Security? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ultimately, it is her decision to make, not ours. Mister Data,proceed with the mission as planned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you took the whole dose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rishon and Kevin? And? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, it's clear you're in pain. You can't get throughthe next hours without help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat said that if we created the temple, then it would get herattention. It may be some time before she shows herself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Counsellor Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will not be necessary. I have full confidence in myEngineering staff. I will be at the banquet on time. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean you're not born reading minds? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite right. So you should. It's all over, Q. You have nofurther business here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, ascertain their offensive potential. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stop your descent. Prepare to disengage theinterface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that's what I'm going to have to do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I've been wondering if they were the right ones. Sometimes I feel we've allowed our positions to isolate us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kamala. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid there are two more injuries in Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fifteen thousand! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I certainly did, and I expect it to stay turned off. Wouldyou come down from there? I see you've made yourself at home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca Six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frere Jacques. That'sa song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know thatone? Good. It goes like this. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormezvous? Dormez vous? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm sure you'll see there's nothinghere to appeal to a young person. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Neither do I, Counsellor. How soon can you beat Galorndon Core, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm simply considering all possibilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently we were all unconscious forabout thirty seconds. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handledit quite well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the inverted T means to hold the Z. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had fullconfidence in me. But what if it were to change? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he is the creature of conscience I believe him to be, he hassomeone to help first. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't see anything. Magnify section two eight five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously, they did not expect and never wanted this challenge. You're getting close to something, Lieutenant. Something they care agreat deal about protecting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge untilCommander Riker returns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you create the anomaly? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before it loses integrity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: These people are no one's enemy, Senator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready phasers, and lock! Stand by on warp nine. Heading seven,seven mark twenty. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I thinkwe could risk a minimal away team, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set auto-destruct sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf's challenge is successful. The honour of his family mustbe restored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you for your concern. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. Wehumans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never toomuch, never too little, and it's very nice to find a culture that iswilling to take an experience to its furthest extreme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transfer Engine control to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was cold and dark because I was outdoors at night. I was ina narrow place. I was walking through an alley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My pleasure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Two to beam up. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Who was this man? Who killed him? Where's themoney he was talking about? It's a mystery. Now, we have to go searchfor clues. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The fact of the matter is, we are dealingwith a potential breakdown of the main computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, you are a computer simulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Good to have you aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of theartefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. Iwanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar onDessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me. They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on, stay with me. Come on now, stay awake. That's anorder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course you couldn't. It was the most human decision you'veever made. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

But regardless of this planet's immediate situation,we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimise the risk ofcontact with the inhabitants. You will go alone, Mister Worf, and Iwant to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as aBoraalan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I assure you. The Federation places the highestpriority on this mission and its goal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that was a simple misunderstanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Activate your viewscreen. I would likeyou to monitor what's going on up here. I may need your input. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you want to be the prey forever? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're on board the starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Surely Sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion? <eos> <bos> PICARD: To study you. To understand your ways. Discontinue, Mister LaForge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait for my order, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't survive in this sun. Where there's mountains, there'sshelter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that may well be. But Wesley's one of our own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'll go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your invitation was unexpected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is unlikely you are prepared to discussterms. It is more likely that this is an attempt at deception. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there,Q. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the SeldonisFour convention governing treatment of prisoners of war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I won't insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy. But I can tell you that the Enterprise will not leave them behind. Youcan be assured of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Afraid of what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How contagious is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't let this just happen again, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I do not want to kill you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reason enough for anyone to go to war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that was Miranda, all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaboratemeals either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How strong are your shields, Captain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can you beam him out of there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But they could just as easily have shot her where she stood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to propose a swap. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you should beam aboard our ship. There's something weneed to discuss. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Captain, Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In order to know whether Ambassador Spock's message is beingdelivered accurately, I need to understand something about themessenger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher. Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, this starship operates best when my officers sharewith me what is their minds. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, this is Captain Picard of the starshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, go back to the biofilter readouts taken of the awayteam's transport from the moon's surface. See if you can come up withany clue that might explain this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The new friends went out into the desert together, where thegreat bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught thebull by the tail. Gilgamesh struck it with his sword. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You interfered with our Farpoint mission. You threatened toconvict us as ignorant savages, if, while dealing with a powerful andcomplex life forms, we made the slightest mistake, and when that didn'thappen Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings abouttwo kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Doyou understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back assoon as I can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker has told me how supportive you were inEngineering. Well done. At ease. Sit here in Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he injured? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For that information you'll have to ask him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Believe me, Beverly, there was only one decision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll send an away team, Prime Minister. Picard out. CounsellorTroi, Commander Data, Mister Worf, you will accompany me to the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't open this door. We're going to have to climb up to thenext deck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell them the human who destroyed their comrades is here andwishes to address them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The shield that protected your world in one way is weakening itin another. It is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle. It's fourbillion years old. A computerprogramme from a highly advanced civilisation, and it's hidden in thevery fabric of life itself. Whatever information this programmecontains could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the mostdangerous. And the Professor knew that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Won't the moon disintegrate prior to impact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you sure that that's it, Number One, or are you beinginfluenced by personal feelings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Especially since we know so little about their origins. But I think that I have constructed some plausible theories of my own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, you're the last person I'd expect to argue infavour of accepting the challenge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With whatever force necessary, terminate that beam. Fire whenready. <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that what they are? Tests of pain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate theanomaly in the Devron System. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, you were recruited for one mission and if you wish tobe relieved of further duty, I can certainly arrange it. But I'd likeyou to consider remaining in Starfleet. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, yes. I never know when I'll have the opportunity toride. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? What is your scientific basis for that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A rift? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position toyour government if you wish, in case you're unable to complete yourrepairs and you remain stranded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, control your emotions. Please, open hailingfrequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, stay with them in Jeremy's quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you expect us to do now? You have left us with a colonyof Boraalans who think they're still on their planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can persuade them to give back controlof the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Activate it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To the family that's irrelevant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, but you are also a man of great importance and wealth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You fell asleep. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'mpec! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Enlarge and identify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have these intense feelings of fear and panic. I feel as if Iwere being watched. I can't explain it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? Oh, yes. Alright. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, provide security. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did this happen to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid I have no choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about you, Rishon? Is that how you feel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Recognise it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, what's our at the planet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's all right, it's al right. I'm not going to hurt you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it a wormhole? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. He's fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The risk is too great, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spentsome time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it stillremains a mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counter-punchers. Thank you, Counsellor. That's quite valuable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want of me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. My Chief Medical Officer has explored all other probablecauses. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. Viewer on. Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q. End this. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Since Professor Moriarty never actually left the holodeck, hemay demand that Commander Riker help him to do so. How long until theplanetary collision? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar? It's your choice, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is somuch to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mister Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've established the presence of whatappears to be an alien entity on board. It seems the entity hasmanifesteditself in the form of a twelve year old human girl who has been seenwith Clara Sutter. She has blonde hair, blue eyes <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come back with me. They won't know how much you know. You mayshake loose the truth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're still your people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have we disabled the Medical Lab computer console? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of what, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Number One. Mister Data, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You made a decision to leave the ship? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put the asteroid on the main viewscreen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why wouldn't he tell us the truth? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Surely you have emergency supplies? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous childplaying on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew everycontrol, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on theBridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, Iwas convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've neverquestioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of everyStarfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, orhistorical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle uponwhich Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to standup and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wearthat uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place,or I will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless, of course, if you would prefer a porch. It wouldcertainly be easier to build. I could make a start on it right away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really, reallyaggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding tosome predatory instinct? Do you think he see us as prey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The lines are being drawn. All this for a chosen son. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I've spoken with Admiral Brand and she's agreed to allowus access to all of the physical evidence and testimony. Thank you,gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope that by the end of this matter, you will no longer lookat me as an adversary. My family. Well, our roots in Western Europe goback to the time of Charlemagne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it's just that for a moment you sounded more like WillRiker. We have received information that the new host will arrive ineighteen hours. Will you be all right until then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can imagine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know what the infection is? Come on, quickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all hewanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. Iwish he could find some focus in his life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The loss is mine, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems the Edo Lord agrees with you, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. lieutenant Yar, open channel. Enterprise toshuttlecraft. Mister Kurland, this is Captain Picard. Mister Kurland. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: One to beam down to away team location. Hurry! Engage! Transporter Room. Urgent! Engage! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any trace of the other vessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As Lieutenant Worf discovered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, seal off deck eight, corridors Aand B. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can I help? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase power to the impulse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. That was your own damn stubborn pride. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What problem is that, DaiMon Bok? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I promise you that when I leave this house I will never setfoot in it again. But the Enterprise will remain in orbit over theplanet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data to the Bridge, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whenever I get insomnia, I try to perfect the recipe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long aspossible! <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the source of this energy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrangetransport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to movequickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A very dangerous piece. Were you really going to give this tothe DaystromInstitute? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There will be another day, Commander. Do not forget what hedoes here today. Do not let your children forget. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Come in, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, you're with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There was a crime committed on board this ship, but it was notJono's. It was mine. When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had tobe done. We knew that if only we could persuade him to make thedecision to stay, then you would most likely let him. So with the bestof intentions, we tried to convince him, and in so doing, we thoroughlyfailed to listen to his feelings, to his needs. That was the crime, andit has taken a huge toll on a strong and very noble young man. And itmust be rectified. He will return home. To the only home he's everknown. And to the father that he loves. To you, Endar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! I want my father! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dear God. Let's salvage what we can. The first thing we'll needis shelter from the sun. In this heat, the shuttle will act like anoven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely that's an impossible task for you, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Er, I, er. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection! It doesn't matter. Objectionwithdrawn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the Ferengi pod, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, transport Mister La Forge and the Romulandirectly to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Remmick, either get out of my way and keep quiet, or Iwill have you removed from the Bridge. Viewer on shuttle cockpit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Specify. What kind of disturbance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a sense. But who knows? Our reality may be very much liketheirs. All this might be just be an elaborate simulationrunning inside a little device sitting on someone's table. Well, wehave a newborn star to study. Mister Barclay, you will keep that safe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. And the mission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, let's proceed without the pipe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Commander, do you have anysuggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the shiponce we reach the Pelloris Field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cheat fate? Perhaps we can't, Mister Data. But at least we cangive it a try. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It enveloped us. It moved. All stations, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he's no longer there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it you wanted to see me about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put youinto an escape pod and return you back across the border. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will deal with Mister Data at another time. Meanwhile, I willhave to write this incident into your permanent record. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because you feel unworthy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enemy? You mean the Kes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If it works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can returnlater. If it doesn't <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't. You're right, Mister Tholl. Any of us may be theenemy. And there is no way to prove that we aren't. But until we setaside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope ofescape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are we looking at? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pay off your wager. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pardek represented Romulus? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Brull, in twenty days, I hope to be very far away from here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inhibited, I suppose. But then, I'm not Wesley. And if you areconcerned about him, I see no evidence that there is a problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How old is the boy now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have no wish to kill you. We never have. <eos> <bos> PICARD: These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will findanswers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerousthreat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battlereadiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that part. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were right not to try. Once you became accustomed to thatpower, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, he gave me quite a game for his first time out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The holodeck makes excellent use offinite space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know who it is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that's right. It's on deck seven. I left it in thecorridor. And then the power went out and I got lost <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate and display the text ofthe novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. <eos> <bos> PICARD: After you. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I want you to drive the warp engines to fullpower, and direct a flow of energy out into the nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Matter of internal security. The age-old cry of the oppressor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began togrow and to evolve into something other than an automaton. He became aperson. When that happened, I felt I had no choice but to respect hisrights as an individual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when the Legarans beam on board? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Have you cancelled your leave? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This way, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, Counsellor! Oh, no, Counsellor, I don't think so. Heneeds someone who is trained in these things. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, I would just like you to know that Commander Riker is <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we beam an awayteam onto the science ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that thefamily would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, butyou've interfered in the burial rituals of another culture. You've putboth of us in a very difficult position. The family will have to benotified. I don't doubt that they will react strongly. If the Ferengigovernment becomes involved, as I'm certain they will, this could havevery significant repercussions. I'm not sure how much I can protectyou. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands, this is the Captain. As you may know, the sunin the Delos system is undergoing large-scale magnetic field changes,producing violent, gigantic flares. Now, we shall be studying this starat close range. Even though we shall be running with full deflectors,the closeness of this event and its severity are going to createproblems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will need to be. Tomorrow I'll be addressing some of thegreatest scientific minds in the Federation. Switzer,Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland. Giants in the field of archaeology. Compared to them I'm just an enthusiastic amateur. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well take all the time you need. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My fault? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove theinhabitants from Dorvan Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you say that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treatyof Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you escort Commander Data to Engineering? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we ever needed reminding of the importance of the PrimeDirective, it is now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth justto drop by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought that I had made that clear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When children learn to devalue others, they can devalue anyone,including their parents. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not recognise your claim on the Enterprise. Nor on thisworld, for that matter. In accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent, Icall for an arbitration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, you've been at this for hours. You might think moreclearly if you got a good night's sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gowron or K'Tal? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do I really seem that different? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That kind of control is an illusion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Success, Mister Conor. With the upgrades to your biosphere, thecore fragment should no longer be a danger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Picard out. I want to speak to her personally abouther son. So you promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Graves, listen to me. No one can deny the significance of yourtransformation. But I don't believe that this was part of your plan. Encountering Data was mere coincidence. One that offered you more thanyou could have dreamed. But something has gone wrong. Look here. Graves, this experiment must be terminated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation's top negotiator taken outby a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a long range subspace Array. We use it for gathering dataon astronomical phenomena. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have youmade a decision? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that is your wish, we will respect it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Too bad. I rather enjoyed the idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare timecharting the stars. I disappear for days at a time exploring thecountryside. My life is very much as it was. Old habits. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe we should contact her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please inform the Academy, Mister Worf, and send my regards toSuperintendant Brand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. An ale for me, and for my officers. In fact, alesfor everyone. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are as sceptical as I am. Is it logical to ignore your owngood sense? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, an update, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know which transporter was used? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. Times twenty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bok! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, where is the Devoras now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet's finest. Fancy meeting you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, let's begin this with a show of good faith. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, exit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you will be missed. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Full impulse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't belong on that ship, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So I am sentient, but Data is not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not in here. Hey, you, where's the artefact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has astarship, he has technology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not good enough, damn it. Not good enough. I will not ask themto die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Number One. I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has something else happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shaka. You said that before. When I couldn't build a fire. Isthat a failure? An inability to do something? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, they've endured generations of sympathy and promises. How can I believe this Orta will be satisfied with more of the same? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my orders, not before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, the stakes are higher. But then, isn't that when the gamegets interesting, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are disturbing overtones in the ideaof a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware ofany other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might haveencountered recently? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will youescort her to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm really anxious to see the final artefact, because it mightprovide a valuable insight into Vulcan mythology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Introns? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic volcanicactivity. Perhaps the planet has entered an active phase. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Continue to monitor them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I walked. For hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if I don't inform you there is a reason. I don't likekeeping you in the dark, but for the next few days I may not be able tobe as communicative as usual. It may make things difficult for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. Yes, well, that wouldn't work here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's imperative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: But how could that be? We both saw the woman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. We are also explorers. We mean no harm to anyother living creature. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look at this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's it's source? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The saucer module should fall out of warp in two minutes. Beprepared to sweep back. Pull it in with a tractor beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a veryimportant mission. A mission that could put you in a situation thatwould be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commandingofficer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, put us into synchronous orbit above thatposition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want any distractions. You, stay here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the scout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is not a rock on the trail which once seen can easilybe avoided. This is much more complex. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what do I do here in Ressik? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander K'Nera, this is Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By the time we reach Parliament, Mister Singh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. Therewere loose threads, untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. Butwhen I pulled on one of those threads it unraveled the tapestry of mylife. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a manner of speaking. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold a position five hundred kilometres from the periphery ofthe asteroid field. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know that for a fact, Kevin? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If your engines are functioning we'll attempt to break free. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Both of us. Now, if you will help me to get to theshuttle. Ow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sovereign. Brull! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it wasn't. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments. They're very nearly in perfect condition and yet they're seven hundredyears old. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Starfleet keeps me very busy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's so much here we could have learned. I really regretlosing that opportunity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, perhaps you should take Mister Data toEngineering. See if you can find the problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are. He'll probably have the same questions that I do. How did you get here? What ship did you come on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, that would take several hours. We don't have thetime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor. Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not necessary. Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we may never know. Resume. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ficus sector. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, Mister Data, your hypotheses rarely are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: With a cloaked satellite? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I was a young Starfleet officer, not many years olderthan you are now. Top of my Academy Class. Green as hell. And oh, sococky. Too cocky, as it turned out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire when ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you each bring your samples on board the Enterprise, I willcombine them with ours. And then we will all observe the resultssimultaneously, giving no one the advantage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand that you'll be serving on board the Bortas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you don't intend to back off that position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good work, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander of the Enterprise formerly assigned to the Hood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand what you've done here, Q, but I think the lessoncould have been learned without the loss of eighteen members of my crew. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, the concert will ahead as scheduled. But it's a pity thatthe guest of honour will be absent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She believes the Picard is a magical figure. I'm going to showher how the magic works. I'm going to bring her aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, this is Captain Picard. Will you beam theFerengi directly to the Observation lounge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was what? I tell you, Deanna, for atelepath, your mother's accuracy leaves much to be desired. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, as you are unaffected by hyperonic radiation, I'dlike you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft and commence evacuationprocedures. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why is that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Conference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, please. I feel fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know who or what Darmok and Jalad are, but I certainlydidn't come here to start a war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then let her do it, and feel free to do yours. Ship's resourcesare your responsibility. I've always had absolute confidence in yourjudgment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're staring at me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you wish the bodies returned? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can youunderstand what it is that <eos> <bos> PICARD: The alliance with the Federation is not based on lies, K'mpec! Protect your secrets if you must, but you will not sacrifice these men. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La Forge, set course forStarbase Eighty four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, return to the intermittent signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Qapla! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. It hit with more impact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the three of you speak for him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, this is a serious responsibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I got this headache long before I even knew my old ship stillexisted. Still, perhaps you're partly right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian armaments. Data, especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges, wherever applicable,durability, composition, weaknesses of material. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything I can do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona. <eos> <bos> PICARD: After six years, Number One, I don't think I have any excusesleft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you do. I'm looking forward very much to meeting withthe Premier of Iyar. There will be a reception held in your honour whenyou will meet the rest of my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on myway to your home world, but I shall be leaving you in the safe hands ofmy most experienced officers. Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire,is my head of Security. He will be in charge of your safety whileyou're on board. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will beyour personal liaison office, Ambassador Loquel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it was necessary to keep me captive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no. The modulation frequency is in the upper harmonicrange. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I'm aware of your opinion, Commander. This is abriefing. I'm not seeking your consent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe we all know why we're here. If weadmit that, then we can move forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're going up. Ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was a different person in those days. Arrogant,undisciplined, with far too much ego and too little wisdom. I was morelike you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long will it take to determine the exactlocation of the Pegasus? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I will be forced to remove you by whatever means arenecessary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you make of it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me. If you step out of thatdoor, you will cease to exist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do these men want you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Anyone receiving this transmission,please respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did something hit us, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You learn a lot about people from their luggage. Two hundredand twenty five Yoshimitsu computers, five monitor beacon satellites,sevenhundred cellular commlinks, fifty spinning wheels. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell Starfleet we're entering the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief Inspector, we've watched the eventsreplayed over and over again and I am impressed, and admittedlydismayed by the body of evidence against Commander Riker. But isn't itremarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points ofview of the events aboard the space station, we haven't seen whatreally happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'd never leave Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well. it's certainly very exciting work. I've kept up on it inthe journals. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Between intelligent species of good will <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'adlo. I have been pleased to offer occasional assistance tothe Klingon people in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related towhat's happening? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as youare, he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do. Maybe. Enough ofthis self-indulgence. Exit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The flow regulator is frozen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, did you draw any other conclusions from yourexperiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us to understandthis situation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done. I'm going to be fine. I just need to get my breath. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do I hear anger in your voice? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. You read me well enough to sense how I feel about you andwhat you do on this ship. But I just wanted to say the words. Thankyou. Well done. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Doctor, have you prepared a Sickbay facility toaccommodate our guests? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you have to measure your successes and your failureswithin, not by anything I or anyone else might think. But, if it helpsyou to know this, I failed the first time. And you may not tell anyone! <eos> <bos> PICARD: In case we decide to surrender to them, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see no need for it to be difficult at all. I understand yourconcerns. What I'm asking for is time, patience. If you have an openmind, I'm sure you will see that it is imperative that Data and Lal bekept together during the formative stages of her development. Afterthat, I have no doubt Commander Data will be delighted to deliver herto Starfleet Research. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will be with Counsellor TroiPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as ittravelled through space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may have to stretch it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She has been injured. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just throw on any old thing. We're about toget our first look at the wormhole. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My duties in that regard are finished. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that feasible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And she wasn't ninety three years old. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know they won't get very far. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we must convince the Romulans that we're stilllooking for the Pegasus. I want you to continue scanning this system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriouslydamaging their ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any connection between that structure and the shipfragment we found? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The internal clock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to investigate those eleven planetsthat the Ullians visited. See if there were any reports of unexplainedcomas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have? I'm really sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Mister Worf, you will report back to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Point one impulse, Number One. RIKER <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little disoriented, that's all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whom I've killed? What do you mean? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've talked with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro has educated me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All remaining power to the defence systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to know what's going on <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't start. This is important to me. Is there an option? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Make whatever arrangements you think areappropriate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what have you found? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't worry. There's a new ship's standing order on the Bridge. When one is in the penalty box, tears are permitted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying someone was communicating telepathically? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what will that be  <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's just hold this position. Counsellor? You have said yousensed no intelligence in all of this. You haven't changed in thatbelief? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're so wrong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is something the matter, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are going to make another attempt shortly. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, Mister Worf, as you're aware, several new securityofficers will be transferring to the Enterprise next week and I wouldlike to discuss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Civil. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite impressive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Such as? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will controlthe animal myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? Who are you? Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Try it now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have twelve hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're in orbit around Vandor now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Troi, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now, with typical Ferengi logic, he's convinced that theTox Uthat belongs to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, what is my present location? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This can't be. You've been <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know Captain Rice? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please. This is important to me. I believe that I can do more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes. Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure, butthat's what I'm going to put to the test. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I declare the treaty in abeyance, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you've never known fear, Data. But as an acute observerof behaviour, you should be able to approximate it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Geordi. Let me know if you <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but he didn't take it very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, try to reestablish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep at it, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So far. He must be torn. These are his people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or maybe he was thrown back in time, so that we would be ableto take another road. Make a different choice. Well, they say if youtravel far enough you will eventually meet yourself. Having experiencedthat, Number One, it's not something I would care to repeat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, ready phasers. Minimum power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Borg have been busy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for the new coordinates, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, thecustoms here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous,strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry,this is becoming a speech. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Sarek. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep forthat long journey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Send us your design specifications I'm sure we'll be able tohelp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I wantyou there when the away team returns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not be coerced. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When time resumed, did you observe any activity in the engineroom that might <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you short out the power? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All dead? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I to understand the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you recommending? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we speak to Data directly or would that wake him up? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scanning us? Why? What could it hope to learn? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand what you're trying to say. Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what I always called my first officer. So, here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's still time. Ensign, will you work with mister Data totry to remove them safely. If things get worse, we'll use strongermeasures. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare phasers and open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn it, who's out there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you misunderstood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think you should know, this has never been attempted before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that thoseartefacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you down on the surface. As soon as she'sgot those artefacts, she'll leave you behind to be captured byStarfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned todetect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in ourworld, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's possible, of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to programme thephasers, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quickly, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, wait. Stop. There was someone else in the shuttlecraft withme. The pilot, he's injured. He needs your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, our Chief Engineer is checking the transport logsof the Potemkin. Perhaps that will shed some light on the matter. Don'tworry, we will get to the bottom of this. And in the meantime, you willbe taken to your quarters. Try and make yourself as comfortable aspossible. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know of that. Perhaps it will be helpful to both of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, the Uthat belongs to your time, not mine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But at what cost, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, one quarter impulse. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Talk to him, Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to get under way as soon as possible. Thesituation on Garadius Four is becoming serious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Clark, this is Captain Picard. We are ready to beam youand your staff on board the <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's hope. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, but it may be enough to turn us into orbit, hold ourdistance from the photosphere. Ensign, port thrusters ahead full,starboard thrusters back full. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, that's quite true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's wrong, Commander? You having second thoughts aboutbetraying your comrades? Because that's what you've done, betrayedthem. Betrayed them in order to save yourself. You used to be just asecond rate officer, now you're a traitor and a coward. How does thatfeel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Repeat the hail all channels. You see, they have no way ofknowing how accurate our sensors are. Put on your best poker face,Number One. Open a frequency. Commander Tomalak. It would appear ouraway team has rescued a second man from your one man ship. We'repreparing to beam them to the Enterprise. After which, of course, wewill return the survivor to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But that does not mean identical, however. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't do that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What female are you referring to? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Natural causes? What in nature could cause that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's our position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you translate it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I promise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to samplea variety of dishes, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are conducting energy output studies of the Mekoria Quasar. All systems normal. The ship is fully operational. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain. This is the Captain of the Enterpriseresponding to your signal for help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! Over here! The door's over here! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you endangered this vessel in which we all travel. Younearly killed a crewmember. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Weapons status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not up to us to judge their laws, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, eh,Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume heading to Pacifica, warp factor eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the class of these ships, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I request a recess. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I demand to see a neutral representative as required by theFederation-Cardassian peace treaty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Their lives are in danger and they're beaming over cargo? Number One, I don't understand these people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fityour crime. You're free to return to the planet and to make Rishon liveagain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed of any changes, no matter how small. Captain's log, supplemental. I've been informedthat Mister Data has recovered the logs from the duplicateshuttlecraft. I am more than apprehensive to play back a log which willnot be recorded for several hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have they found us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the United Federation ofPlanets. We do not intend transgression of <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean the interphasic organisms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They won't come to the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? Oh, yes, well these life forms feel such passionatehatred matters of custom, God concepts, even, strangely enough,economic systems <eos> <bos> PICARD: A spider? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, hardly possible, Number One. Lay in a course to thesource of the signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I a prisoner here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I also can't ignore that we have greatly outclassed theonly enemy vessel we've encountered. And that everysingle possible shred of information which might shed some light onthis situation has been conveniently eliminated. I feel as though I'vebeen handed a weapon, sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger. Well, I need some moral context to justify that action, and I don'thave it. I'm not content simply to obey orders. I need to know thatwhat I am doing is right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you find me some way to communicate with thesethings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Headache. Headache. Surely you know what a headache is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have notbeen affected either. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity,apparently, has no bearing on the phenomenon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If my crew say there was no sabotage, then you can be surethere was none. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, that's certainly another option, but as we're stopping atStarbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know, Number One, but she needs our help to get back. Mister Worf, keep your lock on her no matter what happens. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I remember the same discussions between mother and father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council. Youare a member, aren't you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell us what you need, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of ourfindings to both vessels and to the High Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have no idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Is there nothing you can do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like the two of you to piece together a picture of hislast few days. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, stop the transmission. That is an order. Doctor Marr,do you hear me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Because Lore tells you so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This situation has existed for a very long time. These twosocieties are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And who speaks for his family now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was he trying to contact her telepathically? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I shall summon him for you. Get Riva here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not to my knowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Ian, I don't think I've played with puppies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what I thought you said. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Ourcaptors refuse to show themselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scan for lifeforms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself. Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy forit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Also, please tell him that I am immensely gratified that he isprospering so well. A tribute to his skilled leadership. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A scout ship? What would a scout ship be doing this far intothe Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has a legal claim, Mister Worf. Your personal feelingstoward him <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we have no way to prove Mogh's innocence, and Worf willdie as the son of a traitor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for the next closest station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe that it was. Gentlemen, we have a way home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantlyaggressive move? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Repeat your last transmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Satok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As in Admiral Rossa? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean where you wanted her to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us back, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it out! <eos> <bos> PICARD: In truth, I simply do not have authority in this matter. I'mnot your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in mycustody, and that creates the dilemma. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, has there been any response to our hails? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why isn't the anomaly being affected? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He wasn't violent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was it a resettlement of their choosing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may be dealing with irrational people, Data. Is there a wayto trace this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly, Mister Worf. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold him steady. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Please, come in, sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it through. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you're the key to this entire mystery and you've donenothing but block my every attempt to solve it. Why are you fightingme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's ignoring me. What other explanation is there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: An escape pod? Then he couldn't have travelled very far. MisterData, are there any other signs of ships in this area? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board theEnterprise for a few more days? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Ensign, set course for the Guernica system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll, um, we'll take a short recess. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? What is the source of that risk? The energy field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will discuss the matter with Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Lieutenant Worf. You'll make no move against him unless Iorder it. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if she really is Q, she must understand what that means. Very well, I will introduce you. But we cannot argue like this in frontof her. We must at least appear to be Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose you can give me any indication why this manwants you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose I have little choice. Where'sRiker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's no concern, Number One. It's here and it's precisely onschedule. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've requested assistance as soon as Argh! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good evening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're not intruding. We're just finished. Come in. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You had the full tour, I trust? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In light of your telepathic abilities, it raises the question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we are not. We can cure many diseases and we can repairinjuries, we can even extend life. But for all our knowledge, all ouradvances, we are just as mortal as you are. We're just as powerless toprevent the inevitable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bearing two seven, make that two eight five, mark two fivefive! <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will take hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understandable. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on, you've done this before. It's just like on a holodeck. One step at a time, just climbing steadily and slowly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What else? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He said he wanted to be alone. Perhaps it's a bigger moment forhim than we thought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I showyou to your quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what the hell is this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm also a bit troubled by it describingyou as imperfect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Must have been terrible when the colony was fighting for itslife. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. Now. No lengthy farewells. Good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Crewman? What is going on? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was hoping we'd learn more about it. But since we can't, takeus out of here, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher just called me with the results of the DNAcomparison. Ishara is Tasha's sister. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nuria, your people live in huts. Was it always so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're going to have to prove that you are who you say you are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transport to the Romulan ship as soon as we're within range. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope for the sake of the project that I hope you're right,Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, my fencing partner's cancelledfor this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is everyone off the Fleming? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. Access. Captain's log, supplemental. We now know who hascommandeered the Enterprise. The Bynars. We can't communicate with theBridge. Commander Riker and I will now try to regain control of ourship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what do we know about this Ardra? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, for your final mission aboard the Enterprise you willaccompany me to Pentarus Five while I try to sort out the problems withthe miners. Commander Riker has told me you've been studying theeffects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation Law. What betterway to get first hand experience? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If someone homed onto the subspace signals created by ourmodified signal array, could we do the same to them? Track the tetryonemissions to their universe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up theLife Sciences on this mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: yes. Absolutely. That's why we're out here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the very core oftheir being. How would this affect others on board the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, but her inertia will carry the Stargazer along with us. Ordid you sleep through the Academy lecture on conservation of tractorbeam power? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. Go to three quarters impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said Karnas was a proud man, Admiral,probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation. Is itwise to press him on this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have time to argue. You must go now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Poorly timed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are at a desperate impasse in the Peliar system. The attackon the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you communicate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can search it twice as fast if we separate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Twenty five minutes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved. He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative. He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information aboutCardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very wellenhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector. Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back toCardassian space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With so little of even our galaxy explored, I find it at leastpossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I take that to be a yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, keep that option ready. In the meantime, proceed with theanalysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will be all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The coils stay here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'llbe in main Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: More familiarity with our own mythology might help us to relateto theirs. The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hopeof communication, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life. Thank you, NumberOne. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Of the starship Enterprise. Of theplanet Earth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold for orders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing our sensors were able to detect indicated that theEssex went down in that region. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead and beam your passengers onboard. Counsellor, after you've seen to their needs will you escortthem to my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. The only person you're truly competing against, Wesley,is yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You seem rather taken with her, JP. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would rather destroy the ship than allowthat material to fall into the hands of terrorists. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reachthe centre? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll go in your place. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We were once as you are now. To study you is to understandourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It breaks my heart to look at him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Say Mac, I would like to buy a newspaper too, but I don't haveany money. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, itsclockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter,energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence mustbe more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyondEuclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existenceis part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we switch the input? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What a tangled web we weave. I have difficulty rememberingwhose side I'm on. So, what have you been able to find out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently, that part of the plan didn't work very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it have been a natural phenomenon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona to the Bridge immediately. Open. The same demandhas been made by the Atlec legation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have a better one? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Decades ago, light years away, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your vision of Doctor Soong. How is your investigationproceeding? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And my understanding is these men areprogrammed to survive. Is that correct? <eos> <bos> PICARD: While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'lladjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you stole it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's have more talk, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse angle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A little time together? How much? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Check it again, Mister Data, and check every Ventaxian legalprecedent for the last one thousand years. We'll talk again in themorning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Recommendations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Several? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thirty minutes, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't recall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Delete audio. All right, this'll have to do. We're here. there's a service conduit that runs to here and then leads to aJeffries tube here. But you and Ensign Ro will still have to cross thiscorridor before you can get to main Engineering. RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Belay that. Computer, estimated arrival at Pegos Minor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You admire him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is my security chief! Get me Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meeting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I appreciate your concern. Transporting to the surface isonly going to make a bad situation worse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no. I'm fine <eos> <bos> PICARD: Visit their ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Please, will you tell DaiMon Solok that we're interestedin transportation to Celtris Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you think that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm sure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand the allusion. Colours representing countries at atime when they competed with each other. Red, white and blue for theUnited States. Whereas the French more properly used thesame colours in the order of blue, white and red. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's unclear. We're running a full analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm convinced the damage will be irreparable if they'reseparated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm notgoing to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister LaForge, do you have any ideas? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the cause? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you are Borg. Your goal is not to destroy but to assimilateus into the collective. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on the screen, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. That will be your top priority. Very well,proceed. Bridge to Ten Forward. Now that we are moving the ship as yourequested, I would like to know the nature of the injuries to themembers of my crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yet at one time you found something very appealing about it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not accustomed to seeing anunsatisfactory rating for one of my crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, post security guards at all emergency airlocks ondecks <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bearing and speed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Drop the force field. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Somebody? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even if it leads you into a Romulan trap. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That thought has crossed our minds. Your god up there mayinsist that we obey our non-interference directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just half an hour ago he was crying like a baby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A carrier wave? Is that how he's manipulating Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scan for life signs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless you have any other options, yes, I think that's best. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, we cannot exterminate something that may or maynot be intelligent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, are you saying that you didn't want anybody to see whatyou were really feeling? What were you really feeling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought I was Captain of this starship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data is a valued member of my Bridge crew. Based onwhat I've heard, I cannot allow Commander Data to submit himself tothis experiment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the shrieking noises that you made? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use histechnique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more. NumberOne, tell Kosinski prepare to get us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he has nothing to give us, we should kill him now and bedone with it. Everyone seems to recognise that fact except you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You think that she lied? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which explains why Data could be left outside in no danger fromthat creature. Whatever happened to the colonists, he would be found bythe first Starfleet crew that responded to the signal he transmitted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A mistake. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: The time distortion we felt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I really don't think that will be necessary, Mister Worf. Risahas a reputation of being a most peaceful planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. What do we do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready to receive. Put this on main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Mister Worf, I thought our meetingwas scheduled for eleven hundred hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I doubt it. There'd be nothing to gain. It's more likely thatthey would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understandable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can you make head or tail of it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: With the Gatherer truce in effect, it certainly should be. Wewon't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extendshore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With nothing from us in return? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not accusing you of anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, Iwould say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot give you what you want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, allow me to introduce Chancellor Avel Durken and SpaceAdministrator Mirasta Yale. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when you grow to like it too much? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's not from this world. None of us are. We are from a world,we're from a world of fabulous riches. A world where there are objectsfar greater than the one you seek. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Crusher, communicate with your mother at StarfleetMedical headquarters. Give her my regards, and tell her you have mypermission to remain on the Enterprise, but I will abide by her wishes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I shall certainly avail myself of your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel to the Devoras. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Well, now that's cleared up, let's, er, let's, er, let'sget acquainted, shall we? What do you think of your room? I know it's alittle sterile. But if there's anything you'd like? Pictures, perhaps,or games. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it through, Mister Worf. Excuse me, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all. But your unannounced appearance might haveunfortunate consequences. It would be an awful shame if your ship weredamaged due to some misunderstanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why have you fired on us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Worf. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we help you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By sanctioning their false beliefs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea what killed her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, is that the forward limit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have been fascinated looking into thehistory and traditions of your people, and I was very interested tolearn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led thegroup of Indians from Earth initially more than two hundred years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is to say that this history is any less proper than theother? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll see you at the inquiry. Good to meet you, Mister Locarno. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A life form? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cadet Haro. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish to protect that investment, I suggest that youapproach her differently. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturallyoccurring? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The pain is going away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why did you steal my ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How could this happen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want those codes that Manheim gave Mister Data rechecked andthen checked again. No one is beaming down to Vandor unless we can bereasonably sure they can get through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that asteroid came from the Pelloris Field. If the rest ofthat field is rich in nitrium, it would make a natural feeding ground. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. Heselected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss asstatic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Katherine Pulaski? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The security of the Enterprise is of paramount importance,Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it is true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was the diagnosis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Computer identify musical composition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. Counsellor, I very much appreciate your concern forme, but I can assure you it is quite misplaced. I have carefullyconsidered the implications of having a Borg on thisship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced that we aredoing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable with my decision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Data, I want you and Geordi to return for more carefulinspection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the unknown can be benign or malevolent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Type R? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will certainly grant you asylum, when you have been absolvedof this crime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh well, time to leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have the boy brought to my Ready Room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any idea how many security officers there are onboard a ship like that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought you deserved that much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What brings you here, Q? Have you been banished by theContinuum once again? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point is well taken, Counsellor. Number One, you're goingto have to go down there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: First we've got to get the ship under control. Let's go to theBridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. I want you to prepare a class one probe. Set thesensors for maximum scan. I want every metre of Nelvana Threemonitored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry if you're upset. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I would still make thesame choice I made all those years ago. I just wish that I didn't haveto say no to him a second time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? You've made a mistake. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can assure you, Ambassador, the Federation would neverinterfere in the internal affairs of the Empire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No he's not. He's er, he's from South America. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What I want to know is why? You seemed so happy just a fewhours ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've received a distress call. We're changing course tointercept. Captain's log, stardate 44215.2. The Enterprise hasbypassed its scheduled archaeologicalsurvey of Camus Two in response to a distress call from the Federationfreighter Arcos, which has assumed an emergency orbit around TurkanaFour, birthplace of our late comrade, Tasha Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, we've picked up an automatedsignal from a Federation shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And congratulations. I understand that you were selected forthis internship out of hundreds of applicants. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you carry weapons? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transfer injector control to manual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: AF? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet Command agrees with you, but I would feel better ifyou would consent to an escort or <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not adream, doesn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that would be extremely helpful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. We don't have enough information about this phenomenonto act in a responsible way. I think we'll hold off on ProfessorMoriarty's request for now, but continue with your investigation. Inthe meantime, I have to deal with ProfessorMoriarty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You sound surprised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No doubt, but they will pass. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, the ship is yours, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: About Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is this possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My apologies. I was unaware that you had not been instructed inthe use of the food dispensers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, move us closer. Ten million kilometres. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategicimportance of Outpost twenty three is minimal. Has been for years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will tell you what we know about the planet, and in trade,you will give us your information. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will have the Captain contact then down on the planet andtell them to prepare for your return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you andSpock? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant <eos> <bos> PICARD: Complete waste of time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Confirmed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking forbreakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse theprocess? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the Romulans? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, if you have completed yourreview, you are needed in transporter room three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify yourself and return to theship immediately. Mister Worf, lock on with a tractor beam and returnit to the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of us is hungry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that bringshim. I will not endanger this ship under any circumstances. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the sensors show nothing out there, right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a difficulty here, one that has forced us toaccelerate this entire process. One of our people is missing. My FirstOfficer, Commander William Riker. He was down on the planet surface,coordinating with the observation team the final details of contact. Hedisappeared. My people have made enquiries but they've not been able tolocate him. If there is anything you can help <eos> <bos> PICARD: You and I need to have a little chat about that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign Laren, please have a seat. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status of shields? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Temarc! The river Temarc in winter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lal. You're excused. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I convinced them I was a smuggler. Will, these are not commonthieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts from archeological sitesthroughout this sector. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed tohappen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're blocking the suns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But our spirit, it is indomitable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would youaccompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Soon, my friend. For the moment, I have other duties. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what have you concluded? Does she live or does she die? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: A distortion wave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing in my experience canpersuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know onething. It will not affect my judgment at our next encounter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that I know that you're listening to my voice, I find thatI can't think of anything to say. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, assign it a neutral target. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had the very same tour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of. But you mustn't compromise yourself. You must do what you have to do. Because if I find that my head of Stellar Sciences isn't beingeffective, then I shall do what I must to do and I shall replace her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's their condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What could the ringing symbolise? A bell? Sound? Anold-fashioned way of communicating? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the Q has offered you has got to be close to immortality,Will. They're not lying about controlling space and time. We've seen itin what they can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover thatdistance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, they're alive now. We're going to have to treat them asliving human beings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assemble an away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we get within transporter range without crossing intoCardassian territory? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime,I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing todetach saucer section. so that families and the majority of the ship'scompany can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive,containing the battle bridge and main armaments, will turnback and confront the mystery that is threatening us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation will welcome that day. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To judge what kind of life forms we are? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's get the hell out of here. Warp eight. Now, MisterCrusher. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes the PrimeDirective very seriously. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How's mynamesake holding up to all this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were you with Worf's father just before the attack on Khitomer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we'll proceed to Farpoint. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, I can see why you want to keep the awaymissions to yourself. That's where the excitement is. So, what's beenhappening here? Same old routine, I suppose? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may yet prevail. That's a conceit, but it's a healthy one. Iwonder if the Emperor Honorious, watching the Visigoths coming over theseventh hill, truly realised that the Roman Empire was about to fall. This is just another page in history, isn't it? Will this be the end ofour civilisation? Turn the page. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Apgar killed himself during his attempt to killCommander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it remains to see if he has the support of the law. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a rash decision, ill considered. It's not like Beverlyat all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You needn't. The answer is no. Your actions have been whollycriminal. You will not profit by them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You weren't under fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose, I suppose it must be. I was hoping for more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starbase Montgomery is sending a civilian advisor on board tobrief you on the Ares's mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're right, Q. You gave me the chance to change and I tookthe opportunity. But I admit now, it was a mistake. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Signal the fleet to stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If an apology will do, then I offer it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi, your government expects us to deliver you to theconference on time, and that's what I intend to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memorybegins to fail. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I told you he was the best. I'd like to hear about this, NumberOne, later. Right now I have to work something out with Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surelythere are others who are better suited. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assign Commander La Forge to lead another away team to the digsite. I want to know why this happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interesting relationship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he knows where he is, who's here with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then who will they follow? You? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you must have the capability of affecting memory. Can youerase the short-term memory of everyone on this ship, remove allknowledge of this event, allow us to proceed as if it had neverhappened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were there. The disruptors lost power. Computer, reset fordiagnostic of new sample. Begin scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate itsincorporation. Identify yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That can change. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would have believed I didn't need children to complete mylife. Now I couldn't imagine life without them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate the gesture, but I knowthat there are stronger and younger men from whom to choose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out latertonight, and then he'll want revenge. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the price of that opportunity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I respect my officers' judgements. I wish I could help further. If a way appears to me, I will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's probably still there with the others. I wouldn'tworry. We need to regain control of the ship. Options? RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Jo'Bril, listen to me. It is imperative that you turnthe shuttle. Take it out of the corona. Do you understand me? Pilot theshuttle away from the star. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's where it will be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A touch and go down warping? Mister Crusher, prepare to make itso. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I insist. When you've finished showing the Admiralanything that he needs, you can join me down on Earth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Enterprise medical facility can do anything to help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which was? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. Meet me inTransporter room three. Mister La Forge, you have command of theBridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But in those few seconds, the Enterprise might break free. That's what he, that's what the other Picard must have thought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulans could use this technology as a weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The fight at Maxia. I destroyed an entire vessel. An entirecrew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will that plug the hole? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, this isn't what I wantedat all. It's much to violent. I'm here to relax, not to dodge bullets. Reconfigure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see nothing so bitter about that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to see him. Here. Now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. No explosion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. No doubt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappynews. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island. Temba,his arms wide. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. This is Captain Picard ofthe Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, hey! You stay put. I'm on my way, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This ship has a mission to carry out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why, it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Animal things? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Data. Neither am I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It takes more. Open your mind to the past. Art, history,philosophy. And all this may mean something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, thank you, dear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was a man, taken for all in all. I shall not look upon his likeagain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any way that we can disconnect him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're saying there are holes in their defence system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We never did, Lieutenant. Q suspended time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not all of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Numbers? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What carried the Artemis <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rubbish <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makesus special? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camorauthorities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you and Mister Data will accompany me. MisterO'Brien can keep a lock on our communicators. He can pull us out ifnecessary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Encourage him in what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take every precaution to protect the ship's vital areas. If wehaven't identified the source before the time interval, we'll leaveorbit. If you perceive any further danger, advise me immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Because for me, none of this will have happened yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Check the hull integrity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you knew something, why didn't you say so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, prepare to resume course to T'lli Beta. Mister Data,what velocity would put us back on schedule? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There were stories of prisoners taken back to Romulus, butthese were only rumours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can you not do anymore, Ensign? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amanda, allow me to introduce, er, Q. He's er, he's anacquaintance of ours. We've er, we've known him for years. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, he's no use to us. Finish him now. Let me do it for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyoneon board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you understood one word that we've said? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There'll be no conflict. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, we've had a difficult time with transporterssince we arrived here. That's why we had to send down the shuttle. Youshould all have been aware of that fact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, this may be a long shot, but we should check each oneof these seventeen people to see if they have the correct proteinconfigurations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, if it's anything like the last time, I'm sure you won'tbe disappointed <eos> <bos> PICARD: Position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I, er <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo Three, half impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: What of Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not adrift. The Enterprise is a starship, capable oftravelling through space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shuttle three to Enterprise. Telemetry link enabled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, is there some reason why you're trying to giveyourself more work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, CaptainScott. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you come with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can find away of getting him to ourSickbay by fixing our computer <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many more? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, all I've got is <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not, I think, today, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But Iwish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. Iwould have liked the chance to have known him better. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's that important to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain. We have arrived at the Tyran system. All senior staff to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need his services. He was recommended. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. This is theEnterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed anunfriendly act. We insist that you reply immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security code? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't care for the Cardassians? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm just a little more contemplative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's that obvious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But why would they attack us in the first place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: However, I have, I believe, turned up some new information,that, if nothing else, raises a whole new set of mysteries and I hopethat we can discuss them here together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, take a security team up to deck two. Try and breakthrough from below. Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is your navigational system functioning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've spoken to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a fullinquiry once we reach Starbase two four seven, and that will probablylead to a general court martial of Admiral Pressman and several othersat Starfleet Intelligence. Your involvement in this affair is going tobe thoroughly investigated, Will. There'll be some hard questions foryou to answer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Now, to my right is a larger triangular screen. The topis solid amber. To the left, red. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I'd like a word with CommanderLa Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you coming, Mrs. Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of threat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Then you can offer no reason why they are set on thisprovocative course? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too. If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguishbetween thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him. Now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why wouldn't they? With the Ferengi making these friendshipovertures, I could become a severeembarrassment to Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As it was intended. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, Counsellor Troi. Will you allow me to do the introductions? This is Premier Bhavani of Barzan. Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, I urge you once more to reconsider. The Enterprisecan accommodate a Romulan delegation without sacrificing our securityor <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar, when are you going to tell me who you reallyare? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lets use it. This ship must have a crew. They may still havetheir memories. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, hell. Go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, explain this procedure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all youcan about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained hisrank, I want to know why. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Enterprise. With all this interference it isdifficult to copy your transmission. If you all talk at once it isalmost impossible. Now, please say again. What is your situation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arrogant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

A position has opened up in this year's class. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can you hear me? Data, respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't have to do this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker, can you read me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we reactivate it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just a moment, Number One! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remember what you told me back at RelvaSeven, About the threat that you perceived to the very fabric of theFederation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they intentionally jamming our sensors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The pursuing ship is the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Invite him, Mister Data. This is supposed to be a recreationalactivity. The sense of reality was absolutely incredible. When thatwoman kissed me, it was so <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're here to persuade me not to use the invasive programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it would be a shame for Starfleet to lose someone ofyour potential. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: From that window, I could see an entire, er <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, have we any further business inthe Tanuga system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on theexplosive device and energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We desire face-to-face negotiation to settle the crisis on TauCygna Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This hearing is convened on Stardate 44780 as a continuinginquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. Mister Tarses, foryour own protection, I have assigned a counsel to you in the person ofCommander William Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's odd. We weren't notified of a rendezvous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, have you been able toestablish a lock? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So we make an exception in the deaths of millions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are four lights! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, that will be just fine. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready for exactly what, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that the only reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean, possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who's next? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security, this is the Captain. Security? Engineering, this is the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable. You had a reason. I want to know what it was. Damn it, you nearly killed a member of my crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, that's my hobby. Find your own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, when I left this ship, it was in one piece. Iwould appreciate your returning it in the same condition. Do youconcur, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You could use a good herbicide instead of pulling the weedswith your bare hands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Why am I sentient? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister La Forge, it would seem that time is something wehave plenty of. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, come in, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well there should be no problem about our entering orbit. Iasked Commander Riker to contact the Vulcan authorities from theEnterprise and let them know that we were approaching. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any information about the structure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Malfunctioning? You're wrong. Look again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did youlearn anything about the relationship between that and the Edo? Why arethey so certain it's a god? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, Data, I know about the Orient Express. But what is itdoing on Prospero's Island? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona, you are free to socialise with the members of mycrew. I'm talking about a man named Debin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have admitted that. I am only asking for a littleflexibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative, Mister Worf. If we are curious about it, it has aperfect right to be curious about us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We're in a very important conferenceright now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you are telling me there are noexplanations for these malfunctions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the distance from our present position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what happened down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've acquired an interest over the years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course to intercept the Cardassians. MisterWorf, open a channel to the Bajoran vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not curious or concerned as to why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What comm. contact have we had with them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patch visual to Observation lounge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The next time the Enterprise appears, go through it with Data. Geordi will be able to learn from him. Maybe help him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unseal the doors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, try and rest. Take the necessary sleep inducements if youhave to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From where you are, can you determinewhat's happening on the Romulan Bridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Allow me, with the help of Mister La Forge, to explain. Computer, load Manua programme one, time index fourteen four one. Playprogramme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was in need of emergency repair. It was our obligation toassist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maximum shields, ready all weapon systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nor I you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commanding Officer USSEnterprise, stardate 46358.1. You are hereby requested and required torelinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, CommandingOfficer Cairo as of this date. Signed, Vice-Admiral AlynnaNechayev, Starfleet Command. Computer, transfer all command codes toCaptain Edward Jellico. Voice authorisation, Picard delta five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protectoroutdoors? You do? Good boy. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have the two of you met before? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos> <bos> PICARD: An artificially created energy conduit? That could be anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historicalparallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homesbecause of a political decision that has been taken by a distantgovernment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will no longer share in this pointless fantasy of yours. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gently. Don't sit up too quickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're sure you won't reconsider? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may not have five hours and twenty minutes. I'm aware ofthat. How can we slow them down? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit ofspaceships, merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't confuse style with intent. Only a fool would questionCommander Riker's dedication to Starfleet and the men and women underhis command. He is simply the finest officer with whom I have everserved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Food. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How serious is their condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, they'll negotiate, or they'll call it that. They've takenwhat they want. Now they'll rationalise it by throwing us some sort ofbone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, step closer. It looks to me like aspectrograph indicating metal fatigue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They left together. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forward sensors are online. Ensign McKnight, plot a course forthe shortest distance out of the nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's no bother, Wesley. Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I, er, I don't know where to begin. It was <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll discuss this after we've transport over. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The beast at Tanagra. Uzani, his army. Shaka when the wallsfell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the mostdifficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into anindestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purposeof the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-likegarden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. Onthe other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinkinginto nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely adelusion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's put an end to their last cry for help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, where have you gone to, my friend? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please believe me, they're adamant. We are scheduled torendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will pick upReyga's body then. I'm sorry, there will be no autopsy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With the Borg threat, I decided that my officers and I neededto hone our tactical skills. In a crisis situation, it is prudent tohave several options. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That explains, Riker. What about me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in,used, cared for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has been lost <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know what all this is about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a defensive weapon. Have you been able to ascertain whathappened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They will be coming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well. If you'll come with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, I came to see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has indeed, Commander. And believe me, it's good to beback. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I noticed that too, Counsellor. I had the distinct impressionof in the presence of a flim-flam artist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It wasn't possible, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When can you begin the process? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Ardra's magic. Jared, would you believe me if I toldyou that I could steal her powers and perform the same magical acts asshe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, what is the time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut up, Wesley! Lieutenant, pick a good security team, let meknow what he does. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you like Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get a lock on him as soon as you can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand down red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a trade, an exchange. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Screen off. Set course two two three mark three five seven. Full impulse power. Initiate Kumeh manoeuvre. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Keep me posted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their humanrights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You value it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Empty your minds of violent thoughts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know nothing about Minos Korva. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Location? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enlarge. What is their course? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Casualties? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wanted us to review your research, you should have madea request through the Science Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's hard to believe. Your playing is quite beautiful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my place. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil is going on here, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still no response from the Klingons, MisterWorf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to beuntrustworthy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of incentive? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your reputation precedes you. I'm very pleased you're going tobe improving our system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the onewith the problem? I'm aware you've been under stress, and I am willingto let the matter drop if you will report to Sickbay for a fullexamination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Thinkabout it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long will it take to complete a level one search? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Very good. Fine. I'll listen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. Open a channel to the warship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then give me a Level One diagnostic of any onboard sensors, andrun a manual sweep of any anomalous airborne or electromagneticreadings. I want some answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Picard, commanding the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, please don't let me keep up from doing your duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life forms indicated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Doctor, you're charging unknown seas. How do we proceed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lantree, this is Picard of the Enterprise. What is thenature of your emergency? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty ofAlgeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloakingtechnology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can you speculate as to the purpose of thesereassignments? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, once it's installed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This starship's mission is to seek out new life and that isexactly what Commander Data is doing, under my guidance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you match these stars to our charts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put them on screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I understand that before the Jenolen crashed,it had conducted an extensive survey of the Dyson sphere. Have we beenable to access any of those records? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take this message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We'll bewatching. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

A forty eight Packard with white walls. Damn it, Icouldn't get the license plate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Harry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm under no obligation to tell you that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any prior malfunctions on this transporter unit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's so very different from the images we've experienced onthe holodeck, isn't she? She's more intuitive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Respond? Respond to them? What does that mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay away from her, Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to away team. Prepare to return to the shipimmediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any questions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he dead? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroyed, deliberately, after the crash. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Human history is full of many similar legends. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They did agree a bit easily. Well, in one hour we shall knowwhy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's one of the reasons, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have your orders, Commander. And I expect you to followthem. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Our orders were to find him, to bring him back to thecamps any way we could. Perhaps that is exactly what we should do. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what is to guarantee that if they go back they willsucceed? Every instinct tells me this is wrong, it is dangerous, it isfutile. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, remove the forcefield. If you are human, which Iseriously doubt, you will have to work hard to earn our trust. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And do what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That wouldn't be wise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbolbelong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling apath, crossing a boundary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador,with great respect for all that you've achieved on behalf of theFederation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be toleratedany more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get him out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? What do you see? <eos> <bos> PICARD: With no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive. Well,you have twelve hours to think it over. And if it's not too premature,congratulations, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, access Captain Donald Varley'spersonal log. Search parameter. Locate entries containing words Romulanand or Iconia. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, are you familiar with Dytallix B? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You agreed that she has a right to chooseher own future. The first chance you get you try to abduct her. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it alreadyhas, eh, Professor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lore. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. There's not an outpost in this area could defend itselfagainst a Klingon warship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making thissituation worse than it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must see my people in the shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The point, Mister Odell. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf to my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I should have beamed you up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. What's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would be inappropriate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Picard toCommander Riker, answer please. Computer, locate Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cat food? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you were born Jeremiah on Galen Four. The colony wasdestroyed later, during a border skirmish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They haven't always, but now they do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you suggesting, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much Iappreciate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are these animals doing here, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. But if this was a ship full of utopians, whycarry all this technological baggage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jalad at Tanagra. He went to the same island as Darmok. Darmokand Jalad Tanagra. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risklosing you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. Commander, will you accompany Mister Worf to biolabfour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sickbay, this is Picard. Have an emergency medical team meet meoutside Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life form or not, intelligent or not , the safety of this shipand everyone aboard her is my primary responsibility. Data, evacuateall the air from the Medical Lab. I want a vacuum there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assemble an away team, Number One. Include whoever the Doctorrequires to assist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have refrained from launching a counter-attack in the hopethat this can be resolved this peacefully. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And our attacker fired on the wrong one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is Doctor Pulaski? Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A minor mystery?. That seems to be a recurring phrase thesedays. Oh, Diomedian scarlet moss. I didn't know you were anenthnobotanist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me talk to my superiors, find out what's behind this. Giveme one hour. The alternative is for us to continue firing at one other,and in such a contest, you would be at a disadvantage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's doubled back on us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would not expect any. Judging from the severity ofbombardment, I doubt any Iconians survived. Well, Mister Data, let'ssee what sense we can make of this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Corey, listen to me. This is a big mistake. Don't play him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with theothers to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you thinkthat tells me about your character? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you are? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ask if they would consent to an examination, just to becertain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If your lock on the away team wavers in the slightest, beamthem back immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's this? A map of the ruins? I thought that I was the onlyreason you came to Tagus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I consider it equally possible that the two of you, andCounsellor Troi, are overworked, and possibly suffering hallucinations. Now this is an order. You will arrange medical and psychiatric exams ofboth yourself and them. Doctor, are you aware everybody is behavingstrangely? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, it's a little more complicated than that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He knows. And more than that. On this mission he has beenconsciously holding Sarek's mind together as well as he could. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Rager, set course two five nine mark three one eight,half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is notfor you to set the standards by which we should be judged. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you lost your faith in Sto-Vo-Kor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, full about. Go to warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't. And I don't want to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but there's a certain expectancy too. A hopefulness aboutthe future. You see, Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past andthe future. Hope and despair. Data, what is this? Is this part of yourprogramme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's safe to say that you're his bestfriend. Is it possible to speculate about what's happening to him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, it wasn't easy to get this record. I had to pull inquite a few favours at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seemsthat it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was thePegasus carrying sensitive equipment whichmust be allowed to fall into Romulan hands, not only was there amysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't, butit seems there was a mutiny on board. Now, I've read the officialreport of the inquiry on that mutiny, but I want to know your versionof what happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's added another chair to the negotiating table. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise will hold its position, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: According to the laws of physics, this is impossible. We wouldhave no idea how to do it again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And who is this Ardra? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, take a seat, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, Iwill release my officer into your custody. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna. Anna! Anna, where are you going? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How will these resonators destroy the crystals? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, there is no dignity in this suicide. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you believe her, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why must this One destroy biological organisms? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can we be getting a false reading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your devotion to duty is admirable, Commander, but DoctorCrusher is right. You will remain on the Enterprise until we knowwhether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to know we're very proud of thescience fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue acareer in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your scienceprojects? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. Welcome back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Ambassador is sceptical, but he cares agreat deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success,he's prepared to pursue it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it won't take them long to realise that Rahm Izad is thewrong planet. Captain, you're welcome to join us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does he understand the situation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they still catatonic? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Change course to make a close sensor pass. We can then increasewarp speed and reach Parliament on schedule. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you reading anything, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stellar Cartography. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He had second degree burns on his chest andmultiple fractures of his right arm, but he's going to be fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is going on down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long do we have? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, Lieutenant, the advantage was yours. Come again. Engarde. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is correct, Mister La Forge. Warp factor eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, use whatever means to neutralise the intruder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor Quaice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail. Essentially, what was in the original lab is here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them onready status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Absolutely not. This vaccine sample is a gift of life and weare honoured at receiving it. Would you do us the additional honour ofnow letting us entertain you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Come, sit down. Counsellor, you've had theopportunity to observe Doctor Pulaski for some time now. How would youevaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Romulans have returned to this sector we should knowabout that. Mister Worf, any further activity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,he's still alive. He can help us get away from here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Myriap! Enough. Without cooperation we will get nowhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. We read you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me what you know about this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I feel fine. Everything seems a little smaller. RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. I am Locutus of Borg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A message? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. That would be prudent. Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll do my best. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't depend on it. For all we know, he may still be lying, butwe shall find that out soon enough. Number One, set course for NelvanaThree. Second officer's log, stardate 43465.2. We haveentered the Neutral Zone in direct violation of the Treaty of Algeron. Presuming Romulan warships are cloaked and monitoring us, we expectheavy resistance as we approach Nelvana Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What must I do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happening? Who's transferred the voice authorisation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sensor scans, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. Resume. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is old Boothby? I hope he didn't tell you a lot of storiesabout me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams, but in this case,bad dreams would be more helpful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Advise Mister Conor, Number One, and brief the appropriateofficers. Prepare them for transport as soon as Mister Conor approves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until I disappear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I amgiving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What you neglected to mention was that following the loop yourteam attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash. Youtold the truth up to a point. But a lie of omission is still a lie. Doyou remember the day you first came aboard this ship? Your motherbrought you on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are the allegations, Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find that it helps me think, but the real surprise is I enjoyit so much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to theshuttlebay? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then let us hope they do not believe their survival is atstake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

You'll find him hard at work on deck thirty six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not working. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've spent a good deal of time on the surface. How do yousuggest we change their minds? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not any longer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along. See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging thenodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have aresponsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trust requires time and experience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, andthis happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it canhave <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the problem, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to offend you, Gul Dolak, but we cannot withdraw. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well I have been through every page of the Professor'spublished works, looking for some clue as to where to go next. So far,nothing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I try it, it will be at a time of my own choosing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Additional units? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Signal the Romulan ship that the last groupis on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly, Number One, and I would be prepared to live with themystery, but Data's role in this must be ascertained or he'll never betrusted with starship duty again. Ensign, take us back to the scene ofthe crime. The T-tauri system, warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In time there would have been full disclosure. I can only askyou to believe that. On other worlds it would not be an issue. Buthere, everything our observers reported indicated that the people ofthis world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. Wecould see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act ofaggression. I hoped that we would have found Commander Riker before youdid so the matter would not complicate our introduction. It was amistake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. Minimum complement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, it's an important consideration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is Doctor Pulaski there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rest assured, Gul Dolak, there will be no terrorist attackstoday. We are escorting the Bajoran settlers to their camp on ValoThree. You can monitor their course if you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's just choose one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will your investigation affect our available power during themission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I haven't heard anything about this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well of course, Lieutenant. Choose whomever you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, Federation Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why did it attack you more quickly than Doctor Kingsley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the Enterprise, we used harmonic resonators to relieve thetectonic pressures on Drema Four. Obviously, it's not the same problembut <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think our lives just became a lot more complicated. Get himoff my Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Power to do what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps later. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, you have command until further notice. Please, make the proper ship's log entries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage thetachyon pulse immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me a visual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, we all went into this with the best intentions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You heard me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We all make mistakes. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your hypnotism revealed another form of duality? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, butit means something. There's some connection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evasive action. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you rather endanger Deanna, a friend and a colleague,than tell me what is going on?! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, it's not too late. If you remove thefibres, then Geordi might yet recover. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But when you set foot on this ship again, I expect you toperform your duties like a Starfleet officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then beam Doctor Clark aboard by himself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One way trip. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulans were impressed, to say the least. After years ofdistrust and conflict, they started to talk. You were our key spokesmanin securing the alliance with the Romulans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, you're not confused, Data. You're sensing the truth. Yourethical programmeis fighting the negative emotions that Lore is sending you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert, Lieutenant Worf. I'llbe in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It could all be part of the illusion. Commander Data, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, we're ready in the guest quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Are you comfortable? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. If I should need you further, I'll letyou know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And when I looked down into the street, Iactually saw automobiles! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotationrate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, what do you think you're doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of oneof my ancestors against his people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Twenty dollars a day, plus expenses. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there some way of stretching out the formalities once theyarrive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room Two lock on to the young woman inAmbassador Alkar's quarters. We may have to transport her out of there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Countess, you must understand that I am responsible for morethan one thousand lives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is the Captain! Computer, identify exit! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It wouldseem to suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Duras died in disgrace. By Klingon tradition, his family shouldshare that disgrace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Security, disregard that order, and clear all personnel,repeat, all personnel, from Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Adjust sensors to short range. Attempt a limited positron scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beam them back immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will make the Khitomer massacre files available to anyone whowants them. To the High Council, to the Duras family, to you. Anyone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have no idea what you're talking about. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, what are you doing out here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will not be necessary, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it was little better at the physiognomy workshop. DoctorVassbinder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionisation effect ofwarp nacelles before he realised that the topic was supposed to bepsychology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Use whatever resources are necessary. It appears we may haveencountered a new life form. I want to know everything about it asquickly as possible. Commander Data, supervise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the asteroid we destroyed. That was rich innitrium. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. If you will accompany us to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriouslycurtail the Maquis. We want to give them a target so threatening tothem that they'll be willing to commit as many ships and people aspossible in order to destroy it. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. Mister Data, will you report to my Ready Room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right, you should. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course for Kaelon Two. Warp factor five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I have a word with you, alone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it seems that the discussion is over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have finallyarrived at 'audet Nine, where we will pick up the specimens of plasmaplague for transport to Rachelis. It is only because so many lives areat stake that I am willing to put this ship and crew at such greatrisk. Meanwhile, Counsellor Troi's pregnancy continues to progress atan astonishing rate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I leave town, the town leaves with me. I get the feelingyour friend doesn't like me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is very ill, Perrin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to warp one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify, Mister Worf. Hardly an inviting planet, even for aresearch establishment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put us in orbit of the seventh planet. Keep us at a relativedistance of ten kilometres from the object. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, if you've come here for sanction to take matters intoyour own hands, I can't give it to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know full well I hadn't even met Beverly then. Youintroduced them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets. Whatother explanation is there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the samecommitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer aproblem to someone else. Too easy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full stop. Hold this position again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Narendra Three outpost was destroyed. It is regrettablethat you did not succeed. A Federation starship rescuing a Klingonoutpost might have averted twenty years of war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the autopsy. Medical log, stardate 46075.1. I have performed anautopsy on Alkar's mother, but instead of answering our questions, theresults have created an even deeper mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please report to the Bridge. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've told you all that I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of my officers, one of my friends, was troubled. I had tohelp. Is Sarjenka safely home? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you seriously expect me to accept those terms? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you locate the Krayton? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save downthere is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or KhanSingh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked thatquestion ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this isnot a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's nothypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chancellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Varley died believing that it was. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll take it here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's a, the doll's my cousin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I haven't said yes yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare to take us out of here, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp near that ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what youneeded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We would rather die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An old man. Masaka's father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That you voluntarily confine yourself to your quarters, atleast until we haveunraveled this mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to Security, come in! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get us to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will be all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Most of the secondary systems were changed at the lastoverhaul. I don't think they'll give you any problems, but you mightwant to check out the port lateral <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard. We're prepared to escort you to ValoThree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff. MisterWorf beat you to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me aship with children aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there,back on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pipe it through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean degenerative? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you hear us now? Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q. I knew it. What's going on? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let me know when you finished your sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An alien presence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you couldn't. You were left alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is she alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If this hadn't worked, it would have been necessary to beamyour energy into empty space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have a good idea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. You've covered all the bases. What's your impression ofShelby? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is my choice to respect the ancient rituals. Each of youwill have to prove your worthiness to lead the High Council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And then what you most feared, happened. Rishon went to fightwith the colonists, and died with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue quarantine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So this is affecting the entire crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've had our problems with the Cardassians too, but now thatwe have a treaty, we're in a position to help. Your people have beenforced to resettle all over the quadrant. But now we can make alegitimate case with the Cardassians that this is not an isolatedproblem. We can work diplomatically on your behalf. But first, theseterrorist attacks must end. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You Recognise the old bag of tricks? What about this one? Come back, Ardra, if you can. No? Fine, allow me <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you determine how long they've been gone from theshuttlecraft? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, who will replace you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: To whom am I speaking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You look exactly like Robert when he was your age. I halfexpect to see myself as a boy come running out that door to play. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's aware of me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was a fine man. A man of rare gifts. and greataccomplishments. He will be sorely missed. Does anyone else haveanything to say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, you're just in time. They're about to disembark. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You want me to bring you back a souvenir? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very soon after we combined we had learned much about eachother. A passion for exploration, for the unknown. We found we hadsimilar dreams, and it offered your Captain a way to realise thembeyond human expectations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Probes? The probes. Launch? I launch the probes? But why? What's good will that do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done. Mister Worf, will you escort the Ambassador to hisquarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Readings, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then take us to the outer cometary cloud, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapsethe anomaly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not a relapse I hope. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is anything wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where did youget this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Restart the engine, now! Pull up hard! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And how are you, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've never needed a crew before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must protect the rights of my officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Commander. Minister, we're here in friendship,hoping to provide assistance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. Ithink I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lutan is a fortunate man. You've met Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at thosememories some other way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Van Doren's technique has been perfected totwo point four percent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct. Interval, twenty minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, LaForge. What can you make out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began tounderstand that there was something that was different about them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of questions did he have for you,Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there are points in the negotiations that Briam still hasto address. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two minutes, Mister La Forge. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, I want Doctor Stubbs confined to his quartersuntil further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'm not willing to give them up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, scan analysis on main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indispensable is the appropriate word. I think it should beonly you because you seem more able to control the effects of the timedistortion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was an honour. He is a great man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Premier Bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings, despite mybetter judgment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A pity you weren't a bit more inventive. If fewer things haddisappeared, we might never have suspected you. As it was, the onlystumbling block was your ship. Our sensors couldn't penetrate it. Butonce the door was opened, the computer was able to detect anddeactivate everything you'd stolen, including this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, take charge of the Doctor. Mister Data, shut downthe transmission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, initiate a level two security alert on all decksuntil further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But didn't your researches indicate a thousand adjustments persecond would be required? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you havehere. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I was under the impression there was a cease fire agreement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? Stop it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you still convinced he's me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm very pleased to hear that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain togive the appearance of confidence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you divert more power to thecontainment field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set a course for the Beta Agni Two system, warpsix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree. Do what you can to accomplish that, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Cardassians have destroyed the Bajoran ship, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, sir. No one was on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My Chief Engineer has developed a system that should nullifythat advantage. Each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to theother blockading ships. Now, in theory, any cloaked vessel thatattempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and bedetected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. And I want a level four security alert. I needto know if anyone comes on or off this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it's true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I offer you some refreshment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, ma'am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're going to be sweeping the shipwith a high frequency IP pulse. Will you monitor the creatures for anyresponse? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what youare? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Peace envoy, in a stolen Vulcan ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea? Earl Grey. Hot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Redblock. I have the item. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set phasers on stun. Number One, good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You cannot confine her against her will. Not on board thisship, Ambassador. She is requesting some freedom of movement and Iintend to give it to her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want that point one percent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's on his way, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I take it you find no glitch at all in this planet, however? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room! Is Commander Riker aboard? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? Yes, yes, of course. Proceed, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing forsome dreaded recital. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn, I said put fusion generators under surge control. You'removing too slowly. Arm the torpedoes, man! Vigo! Get a fire control party up here! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse on y danse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortalityrate. Two point four percent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want anyone else going in alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Archaeology has been a hobby since Academy days. But why don'twe talk about what really brought you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge and Doctor Clark have madeno headway. Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf have picked nothing upanything on their scans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did they come aboard with Doctor Quaice? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I'm really dead, then my only regret is dying and findingyou here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain's personal log, supplemental. I have justwitnessed the total destruction of the Enterprise with a loss ofall hands, save one. Me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, recognise Jean-Luc Picard, Alpha Two priority, andre-establish separation procedure immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Last time I was in this sector, I was on the Stargazer, runningat warp speed ahead of a Cardassian warship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would expect nothing less. It won't be for long, Will. Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Thank you, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then my doppelganger caused no serious damage? The replica wasconvincing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You didn't mention you were that certain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, that is sufficient. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What else have you found out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kevin does. He's the cause. At first I couldn't understand whyyour house survived the holocaust when the others hadn't. Then it occurred to me. It had been destroyed. That dwelling, where youserved me tea, where you danced your waltzes, is a reproduction. Realto the touch but capable of being created, destroyed, and created. Allon a whim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the situation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you also know that Worf's life is at stake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On whether or not it has something to do with the Tox Uthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, you are needed in Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can see them, why they can't see us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship will be ready to leave orbit soon, and I belong onboard. If I should ever doubt that again, I know where to come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did she? Commander, could I have a word with you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a discussion. You're restricted to your quartersfor the remainder of this mission. Dismissed. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is Leah? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,and he's not going to get one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, Number One. Now we know whyall that is there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need more information. What the hell are they are using? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have the luxury to speculate. Back us away from thedistortion, Ensign. One half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Later, Data. A fish, Commander. A delicacy from the Caspian Seaon Earth It's a favourite of mine. Our replicator's never done itjustice, but I managed to store a few cases for special occasions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We had a lot to celebrate. Our team wasn't supposed to win. Wewere very proud of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wonder. But the point of this is, whether you and it haveapproximately the same capabilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, you must do what I tell you. Reduce yourvelocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees,now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, thetachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different timeperiods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I meanwhen the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I meaneverything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like thechicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it startedin the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That'swhy it's getting larger in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There will be three Cardassianstransporting aboard. Their Captain, Gul Macet and two of his aides. Myintention is to be as open as possible with them, allow them to sharein our search for the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon, fait bon,fait bon. Ensign, where are we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you feeling better? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. It is your dishonour we are protecting here, isn't it,Duras? <eos> <bos> PICARD: it's just that ever since I was a child I've always knownexactly what I wanted to do. Be a member of Starfleet. Nothing elsemattered to me. Virtually my entire youth was spent in the pursuit ofthat goal. In fact, I probably skipped my childhood altogether. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is something I want you to see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. You were five seconds slower thattime. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you found? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm reading power fluctuations. The force field is not stable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command, and askStarbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher is seriously hurt. We can't contact theEnterprise. The communicators are out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think so, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring us within range of the fragment,Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain'slog, stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best ofStarfleet tradition, Wesley Crusher is made Acting Ensign, with theduties and privileges of that rank. And whether that rank becomespermanent, Mister Crusher, depends on you. At the earliest opportunity,your entrance application for Starfleet Academy will be tendered. Untilthen, you will learn this ship. Every operation, every function. Commander Riker, a duty schedule for Mister Crusher, heavy on study. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take a security team to holodeck three. DisconnectMister Barclay from the computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That should make it about here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, they can't. However, the claim 'I was only followingorders' has been used to justify too many tragedies in our history. Starfleet doesn't want officers who will blindly follow orders withoutanalysing the situation. Your actions were appropriate for thecircumstances, and I have noted that in your record. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you and I don't regret this, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An ancient trail along the Kabul River inthe Himalayas. It's a wonderful programme. Will, it would do you goodto have a little fresh holodeck air. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, in addition to your rank, you are a particularlyvaluable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So there is a hope, but if you have an evacuation plan <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about, Data? Is this still SherlockHolmes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Doctor. We'll contact you again once we've finishedstudying the mission specs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, the Indian Councils is adamant. They refuse to leave Dorvan Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. We come inpeace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But what about your wishes, your needs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try and hail them, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not true. I was interested. And I was proud that my familywere helping to preserve the traditions. I just didn't feel bound bythose traditions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I'm Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which your world furnishes you in plenty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: See if we can determine their direction. Standard searchpattern. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He'll make a fine captain, JP. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted, but I'm beginning to suspect that Commander Data isrefusing to co-operate because he believes he is acting in the bestinterests of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I don't think I need to hear any more. That was trulyunique. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed,Groppler? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was to have been my question of you, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything we'veever seen before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None at all? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm tired of fighting with you, Robert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a map. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, how long have you been in command of this freighter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to review their research. I'd like yourreport as soon as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I suggest that you arrange to meet at another time, afterthe ceremony? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is the crew's spirit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze. To Apgar, this must have seemed as though CommanderRiker were confirming his worst fears. And I believe it was now that hedecided finally to kill him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, Orta's ships are old and obsolete. They don't evenhave warp capabilities. They couldn't have reached another star system,let alone attacked one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will give you more on this as ourunderstanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert untilthe crisis is over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All decks, all stations. Battle stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've just come from Sickbay. Doctor Crusher feels that yourmother's condition is worsening. Her neural foundations are gettingweaker. Have you had any luck here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am concerned that if you return to your own time withknowledge of the future <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Brand. What can I do for you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My understanding is that such devices were impractical. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's one reason we tend to suspect sabotage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You would have me make the decision for you, nut I can't dothat. I am willing to talk to these people with you, and I will urgethem not to make an impulsive choice, but if finally they choose toleave, the Enterprise will not turn them away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cell regeneration? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We need to stabilise this situation. Playfor time. I suggest we move the ship as they've asked. Agreed? Set anew heading, but take us there as slowly as you can. Ten Forward, weare moving the ship as you requested. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, please take command ofthe ship until further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That leaves us but one alternative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anyone in particular? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nelvana Three, Admiral. No base, no weapons, no sign of anylife at all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us to within twenty kilometres of the test ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can it be possible they know what they're doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-calledwormhole. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cadet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not over yet, Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is beyond my power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Now, keep singing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, move the Enterprise out of range of theattacking vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Are they truly incomprehensible? In my experience,communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like tobelieve these are qualities we have in sufficient measure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my ship, the leader of an away team has total control of themission. If you want to judge leadership, why not start at thebeginning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was somewhere else a few moments ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what's at stake? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, identify malfunction immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I want an explanationPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red Alert! All crew to battle stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Sit down, please. Our situation has becomecritical. The cluster remains completely unresponsive. We have not beenable to alter its course toward the cosmic string fragment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't say, Number One. But at least they're not new enemies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you'recertainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What'syour name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I don't want to risk implicating them. Not until I havesolid evidence that something really is wrong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that they will not kill unless their survival is at stake? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have you been able to identify the source of theradiation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Thank you. I'm not much good to you, Wesley. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's very unusual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've had some unpleasant surprises. Will, this isn't a goodidea. Baran might grow suspicious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. Battle stations. Bring us to an attack posture,Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. You have the Bridge, NumberOne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Like Fermat's theorem, it's a puzzle we may never solve. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

That would mean breaking Taguan law. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, wherever possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, that's enough, Ensign. Come to full stop and holdthese coordinates. WESLEY <eos> <bos> PICARD: A home which would look very different from Boraal. You can'treally believe that they'll be fooled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not an answer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would rather not escalate this situation any further. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. LieutenantCommander Data. This is Jenice Manheim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this your Father? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know that is impossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At ease, Cadet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then the Romulans could still be in the vicinity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Change them? You mean change the past? Q, even if you have beenable to bring me back in time somehow, surely you must realise that anyalteration in this timeline will have a profound impact on the future. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were there any indications of reactor core problems while youwere on the station? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really areinterested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on CommanderHutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And elates us. We wish you could understand the gloriousadventure ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What threat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It said you killed some of them. I need to know how. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, we're wasting our energy tryingto escape. It only weakens us. Helm, set a course for the center of thevortex. Mister La Forge, on my command, I want all the power you canmuster. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prime Minister. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something else? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romas, are you and T'Jon carrying this plague? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Paxans. Who are they? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting they're not who they say they are? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Crude by our standards today, Data. But when this ship wasbuilt, humans on Earth were just perfecting the mechanical clock, stillusing steel crossbows in battle. Is there any way to see what's onthis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try hard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laserwelder can be deadly. What's going on in main Engineering? I suggestthat you cooperate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat yourmessage? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mirasta Yale? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lead the security team, and, Lieutenant, you understand withwhom you are dealing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can this theory be proven? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back intime. Is that what happened here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, I really like running around the ship in my barefeet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The men you helped rescue are safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeplygrateful for your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's worth a look. We'll continue our survey along the way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous. I wasto meet someone. Someone here, at this very table. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is necessary. You're in great danger. A warship hasreturned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology and wefind ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age. The loss ofdignity, the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master. Doyou still want to be one of us, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Data. Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And it was believed that the last Tarellian vessel wasdestroyed eight years ago by the Alcyones. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chancellor Alrik. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am the Captain of this vessel! Your order is nullified! Ferengi on main viewscreen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to CMO. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But they do have an interest in driving the Federation and theEmpire apart. Our alliance is the only thing that has kept them incheck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, what's our status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, I can't, Mister <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you read it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, whatever it is we're looking for, it seems we've foundit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And these blood feuds could last for decades? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage, whatever. Theanswer's there, on the planet. Tasha, I want you to provide CounsellorTroi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests. Psychprofiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent, thepsychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many finally? <eos> <bos> PICARD: to take command of the Enterprise as of this date. SignedRear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But can't brain patterns be cloned? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope you are wrong, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps he can help us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, what the hell are you still doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I wantyou there when the away team returns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I could give you safe passage to a transporter pad in one ofthe cargo bays. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there are only six ships. We could even cut back thatnumber. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I've decided to conduct an experiment of my own. I wantto see how you react to being imprisoned. 1+4 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will be pleasant to have her as a guest of the Enterpriseagain. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So the anomaly is here too, at Earth. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, discontinue programme. Computer, exit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patch me into the navigational control of the runabout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There was no opportunity. There was no pause. He just kept talking in one long, incredibly unbroken sentence, movingfrom topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt. It wasreally quite hypnotic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grand. You're dismissed, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shuttles? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, identify humanoid life form in biolab four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge has a possible solution. The margins oferror are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no morethreat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. He's missing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's been locked out with the rest of the commandfunctions. RO JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What lights? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Yes, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, Lal, the Admiral is concerned that you need moreguidance than your father can provide here on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what brings you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Counsellor. He's on his way. Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where were they standing? Data, you're moving about in a very,well, android way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you remove it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: One more thing, Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships were notcarrying scientific equipment, were they? A research station withinarm's reach of three Federation sectors? Cargo ships running with highenergy subspace fields that jam sensors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it? Computer, run Tayna programme four, time index eighteenone four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Okona, you were welcomed aboard without any undueinvestigation. In turn it was assumed that you did not come under falsepretenses. It now seems that you may have done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean to say you climbed through every tube on the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are submicron fractures in the metal casing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There will be other treasures to be found, Vash. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was afraid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now where did that come from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's comparing the Enterprise to a cruise ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll watch this evidence, and we'll weigh itaccordingly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, stop this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you prefer not to return to the surface? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But until we assemble it, we will never know its purpose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shall we go again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down to thosecoordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on yoursignals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strongleaders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. But I'll tell the gambling foreman someone's been tamperingwith his dom-jot table. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We managed to programme the holodeck inside the holodeck, anduse the same ruse that Moriarty used on us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hunting them down is not what I am proposing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, it's a race? An alien intelligence, a new life form,representing a technology far beyond that of either the Romulans orourselves. The Romulans will certainly take whatever measures arerequired to secure this creature for study. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your Honour, nothing in this testament proves that Ardra hadthe power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians. My opponent has failedto prove her case and I move that her claim be summarily dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait. Oh, Data. Your whisper from the dark has now become aplea. We cannot turn our backs. Captain's log, stardate 42741.3. We are enteringinto orbit of Drema Four, the planet from which Data received thedistress signal. Sensors indicate that the volcanic activity isincreasing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you are aware of the procedureinvolving passengers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Locarno. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because kidnapping is an immoral assault. The rights of otherraces must be respected. 4 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From thetop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we tractor them out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It must have been terrible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well. Here we are, eh, Jono? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My First Officer has said that ownership of this cargo is indispute, but this question must be settled by whatever legal mechanismexists between your societies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can tell him yourself, in person. Bringthat ship back at once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have twoextremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command. Our nextactions will have serious repercussions. We have good reason tomistrust one another, but we have better reasons to set our differencesaside. Now, of course, the question is, who will take the initiative? Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I mustlower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface. Oncethe shields are down, you will of course have the opportunity to fireon us. If you do, you will destroy not only the Enterprise and itscrew, but the cease-fire that the Romulans and the Federation nowenjoy. Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave the hailing frequency open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Broccoli? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan. Please, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Now, that bundle of wires, that's optical cabling. Seehow much of that you can pull out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, have you been monitoring all this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The hum has gone too. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Compliments, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know, just do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, wait. Let us talk to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or how to kill it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker. You! You did that! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiettime, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. Thereare some ancient ruins that are just being excavated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm beaming you up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's on page 244. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An illusion. Magicians have been making things of all sortsdisappear for ages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not true. I have the deepest deal of respect for yourbeliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, why don't you show the Commander to her quarters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your caution. In the like vein, I want a complete,detailed manifest of everything you intend to bring on board my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You won't mind if I don't take your word for it? Jared, withyour permission, I'd like Mister Data will review these scrollsthoroughly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wanted to say goodbye properly this time. I shall alwayspicture you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any sign of life? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But how can that be possible? They're different species fromdifferent planets. There should be no compatibility at all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I felt that you would be needed here. Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not something I do easily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I want you to flood them with anestazine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was there a reason? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's our first stop. Verify containment and initiateauto-destruct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And, if we were to violate the Prime Directive, how <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means youhave to get control of the train. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shall we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can confer here on the Bridge, if no one has any objections. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can imagine. Doctor Crusher told me that there were possiblydozens of personalities inside you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the Enterprise. May we beof assistance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the matter with the Bridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Such as the politeness of saying please before abductingsomeone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each ofthose instances <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Take us straight through them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to beam him out of there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck ten. I've been thinking about thefirst time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned topilot me on an inspection tour, and I made some off hand remark aboutthe shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. And the nextmorning I found that he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusioninitiators. Well, I knew then that I wanted him with me on my nextcommand. Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee athousand errors see. But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,who in despite of view are please'd to dote. Shall I compare the to asummer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what was this programme designed to do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you getus home? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did they want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But, your honour! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this brotherly concern? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can we do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not surethat you will be able to integrate it into yourprogramme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Several friends and I were on leave at Farspace StarbaseEarhart. It was little more than a galactic outpost in those days. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is Pardek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That being? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know anymore. I just don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be broughtto you there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When you test next year, and you will test next year, do youthink your performance will improve? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was a wise choice, Ensign. It probably saved you fromanother court martial. Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly since wereturned from the surface? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. Now, you mustfind some way to shut it down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The manifest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I don't understand. I thought all the alien artefacts haddisappeared from the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't not accept that. There must be some way that we canmake the Klingons listen. If we can only convince them <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to perimeter teams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Congratulations, Doctor. This is an amazing achievement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in that course, Ensign, and engage at full impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Cor Caroli Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we have their position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The explanation is simple. Your attempt to capture our ship hasfailed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in thatarpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You say you are true evil? Shall I tell youwhat true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender ourfreedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I remember hearing about it. The ship was destroyed by a warpcore breach as I recall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. He's been reported on Romulus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How will you proceed when you're there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grand. Take a look at thecontainment module our Chief Engineer has designed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I'll have to relieveyou of duty and confine you to your quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did this happen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a photon torpedo. Fire at the enemy vesselwhen ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prisoners on whose authority? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want to order you. But I ask you. I beg you tovolunteer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look at him. He's a different person. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The power cell is ready. We should take itover to the shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some of them, yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of that you can be sure. Good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were you able to salvage anything else from the escape pod? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's say for the moment that may be true. What is the purposeof bringing me here? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're ina position to compromise the security of the Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we have to find some way of staying unfrozen. Mister LaForge, what about a subspace forcefield like the one we used on DevidiaTwo? Could something like that protect us from the effects of thetemporal fragment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, how desperate is the colony'ssituation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wanted to ask, during the second arpeggio in the firstmovement, I noticed that you played an F minor chord instead of adiminished D. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I trust that that can be avoided. I will respond to yourrequest shortly. Viewer off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theEnterprise. We are transmitting visually. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, no! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It'll be the first order of business tomorrow. At ten. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capablespecies. We can only hope that they realise it's in their own interestsand take similar action. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't think of anyone who would have appreciated it more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between theMaquis ships and the Cardassians? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean it's complete? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm delighted to see you. Can I get you something to drink? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. Thatcould be significant. Look, there it is again, and again. And thereagain. This is obviously an important pairing. He isn't chasing heranymore. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The other two Enterprises, they're on theirway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you seem to have developed anaffinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can hebe trusted? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await yourfurther instructions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're all missing some of the fragments, not necessarily thesame ones. Unless we combine the ones we have, we will never learn thesecret of theprogramme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old. But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When least expected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respectedmember of my crew, could be accused of a capital crime. Your actions inthis matter will reflect on this ship and on the Federation. Therefore,it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your sidewhile you make your challenge. I'm sure you would do no less for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A train? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. I can't let the soliton wave hit the colony. Youhave three minutes, not one second more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is our highest law that we shall not interfere with othercultures. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, let's limit their access. But you instruct yourpeople they are guests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: We might be able to deliver it to the same destination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because of your recent training, because you're Bajoran, andbecause of your past troubles with Starfleet gives you a certaincredibility. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have reason to believe that my presence on this mission isimperative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data. Nicely done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this your doing, Q? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security team to Jefferies tube J four, deck fifteen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're out here to explore, to make contact with other lifeforms, to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere. Andabsolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said there is no cure for Iverson's. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you join me on the bridge, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A beginning. But how we proceed is entirely up to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But your fight with Sarek is over, Spock, and you have nonewith me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any sign of the Cardassians? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've already told you that twice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! It is wrong. It is wrong! A lifetime of discipline washedaway, and in its place bedlam. Bedlam! I am so old. There is nothingleft but dry bones and dead friends. Tired, oh so tired. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even Parliament's peacemakers may find this case a littledifficult. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, exactly what do you think the Federation has done? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what went wrong? Why are they dying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where exactly do you come from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Help him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, display the latest excavationschematics on Landris Two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carryon. Ship's log, Commander William Riker reporting. Continuing our appraisal of Ligonian technology. The Captain has madeit clear he wants Lieutenant Yar beamed immediately to safety if herlifeshould become endangered, and I fervently hope the rules of thatcontest make it possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm trying, but the needed ship will not be available for threeweeks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good, Data. But shut down the other holodecks until you'refinished, just to be on the safe side. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tempering is taken to extremes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damaged? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did everyone get out in time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They beamed aboard as a diversion to give their ship time toescape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can beready, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Abort auto-destruct sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you help her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll try and put an end to this fromhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He believes the Daystrom annex on Galor Four would be moresuitable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I couldn't sleep either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've assigned you quarters during out time here. Please, makeyourselves comfortable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beyond? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we must measure our response carefully, or history mayremember Galorndon Core along with Pearl Harbour and Station Salem Oneas the stage for a bloody preamble to war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What else would it be? My heart was injured and a replacementwas necessary. That would have been it, except that the replacement isfaulty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we have no way to track him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then help him to see the reality of what may happen to hiscolony. If he makes the right decision, if he's as good a leader ashe's designed to be, then perhaps the others will follow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In thirteen hours we'll be forced to eitherwithdraw from the border or fight the Romulan fleet. Neitheralternative is acceptable. We must expose their involvement before thedeadline. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If other members of the away team became disoriented, it couldcreate additional problems and perhaps increase the danger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It could be that whatever caused this situation also affectedData. And it could be that he's telling the truth and that this is alljust a minor mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, will you report to my Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Academy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security teams had just been sent to transporter room three. And to Sickbay. Counsellor, will you go to Sickbay and investigate? Mister Data, go to main Engineering. See if you can determine the causeof that power surge. I'll be in transporter room three. Mister LaForge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf. Klingon species. A warrior race. Youtoo will be assimilated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That does not alter the fact that my orders are to <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way. This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place,the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehowintermixed. What we think <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he wouldn't have died alone and afraid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll respect Mister Mendrossen's request and allowAmbassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, myexpectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, memories, his uniqueunderstanding of the history he's made. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. I'm coming down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That'll be all, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not convinced of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Once this Maddox has got control of Data, anything couldhappen. I don't trust that man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, really? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see them, don't you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room! <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it didn't end there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure, Mister Worf. I have never known Data to tell alie, and yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Target that location and define. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us totalk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all. But we are on a purely scientific mission. You haveno reason to interfere with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My Aunt Adele's cure for the common cold. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, when should the results be known? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A member of my crew was being held unjustly. I stand by mydecision. Mister Remmick, you have talked to every member of this ship. I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you'relooking for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to access anyavailable records on Amanda Rogers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you see that, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure Counsellor Troi appreciates the opportunity to spendtime with her mother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understanding has made friends of many different people. We'vehad a good beginning, Lutan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothinghappens to obstruct this mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to one quarter impulse. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, have you been able to determine the cause of thewarp breach? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that much was obvious. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But my things <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are hounding an innocent man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is my Executive Officer,Commander William Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Relationships with co-workers can be fraught withconsequences. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the treatment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. How many more colonists do you haveto transport? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations,Wesley. We'll see that you have another chance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. No. How can I accept this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you need me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Elaborate, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you know this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did your scans provide any insights into these comas? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Under attack? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you'll agree it is enough to present to your leader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The two of you are acquainted? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't risk everything you've worked for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there any others like you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, full. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering! <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long did it appear to you that we were frozen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka is taking over my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I would like to send down a complete away team <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Crusher. Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted, but to go to them now after twenty years later and askthem to leave what is now their home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Signal them at once. They could be unaware of the danger. Theymay need our help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aaron! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Please go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not for one moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Counsellor, with regard to my lecture, what do youthink would provide greater clarity? A chronologicalstructure, or the division of each excavation's findings into variousreligious, sociological and environmental sub-groupings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, shall we go? Gentlemen. Open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, prepare to beam Captain Kargan back aboardthe Pagh. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you're right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we modify the subspace isolators to give us betterprotection? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that youhave a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. Iwas involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four yearsago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It wasall very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I wouldbe leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we nevermanaged to get together again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We see it too, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want toconfront him, settle this matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you strengthen the graviton pulse? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Establish synchronous orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any response from Gravesworld, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think we shall find we have much in common. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will goto Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need you on the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's trying to find an access terminal so he can interface withthe collective. He doesn't understand that the signal has been cut off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We have rescued four crew members from your observation craft. Theyhave received medical attention. The are ready for transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The correct procedure, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify it, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise that it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselvesquestions regarding the future. Go on, Professor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is no longer a matter of how wrong Datawas, or why he did it. The dilemma exists. We have to discuss theoptions. And please talk freely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for aCommander Riker Day next month. I'm even considering making an entrymyself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell meabout these patterns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done longago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thirty seven through thirty nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, what do you do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The important thing at the moment is that one of your ships maybe in jeopardy. Mister Worf, has there been any answer to ourcommunication? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The fragment will have serious effects on your planet withinsix days. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador, when you feel up to it, would you join me in myReady room? <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worryabout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've been ordered to learn all we can about them. Do you knowa better way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're authorised to do so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, do we have him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, put us right in their path and come to a full stop. Fullpower to shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Those are Connor and Moira Rossa. They are your parents. Thebaby is you. Jeremiah Rossa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fifteen years ago, he assembled a team of scientists to expandthat research. They disappeared. Haven't been heard from since. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, let's assume for the moment I believe you, that youare indeed from the future. What is it that you want from me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You shouldn't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, the circumstance of their death's quite odd. A tornadosomehow escaped the weather modification net and touched down in onlyone spot. Amanda's home. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may request additional team members, but in the bestinterest of this investigation, I think you should work with CommanderData. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When I realised the paradox. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Ensign McKnight, plot the most direct course, aheadwarp one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What makes you think that extraterrestrials are related tothese discoveries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're changing course. Set coordinates for the First City ofthe Klingon Imperial Empire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to the warbird. Inform them thattheir government will be contacted shortly about this incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what you saw was some sort of a mouth on Troi's shoulder? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only too well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: More is stronger. Captain's log, supplemental. We have regainedvisual contact with the lab, but our attempts to restore communicationwith this microbrain, as we have come to call it, has beenunsuccessful. One thing that is certain, however. This life form hasdeclared war on us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year beforethat, botany. Now JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is that the trouble I believe it is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the boy ready, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our shields around the Romulan scoutship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm wary about making changes in this time continuum until weunderstand more about what's going on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll join you shortly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski. I want you to go through them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're losing the freighter. Got to beam those people overnow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,I'm better. The injuries are healing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You disobeyed my direct order. You putyourself in grave danger. I am not happy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire at will. Continue rotating shield frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're aware of the risks. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I understand your objections, but I have to considerStarfleet's interests. What if Commander Maddox is correct, there is apossibility that many more beings like yourself could be constructed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm willing to entertain suggestions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, can we use the phasers to open a hole in thesphere? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for the incident in Engineering? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything is possible. So you came back to Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On special occasions. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. That's an order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you, are you children all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you reading any of this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's seven. You said there were eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, monitor your speed exactly. When ithits point zero two zero, I want you to restart the engine <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to Bridge. Situation report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that is your judgement, so be it. We are here to providewhatever service you require. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your service honours us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll handle this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Certainly. This way. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jacket. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When we get wherever we're going, Idon't want Mister Data beaming off the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't have an answer for that. A few hours ago, weencountered a warship. Possibly the one which attacked you. We forcedit to leave the system but we were unable to affect it otherwise. Itcould return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, this is Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jared, you're a wise and experienced leader, and I assume youtrust your senses? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sir, our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to theplanet below. If you're still carrying the infection which destroyedyour world <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Backup generators. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief Investigator, we are perfectly willing to cooperate withyou, but <eos> <bos> PICARD: How comforting, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're glad to be of help, Doctor. TheEnterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any activity at the meeting site? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I look forward to your next concert. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

He agrees with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morningwas absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and youhave given me so much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The tractor beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've got a good crop here. As I recall, it's not easy tocultivate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, not too bad, all things considered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then he should be behaving very much better, don't you think? AStarfleet Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand from Doctor Crusher that Worf will never regain the use of his legs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, we have been exemplary in our patience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lantree, this is the Enterprise. Captain Telaka, this is Picardof the Enterprise. Do you read me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. In fact, it's amazing how little it has changed. Everythingis exactly as I remember it. The house, the hills, every tree, everybush seems untouched by the passage of time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't she. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, assemble the rest of your away team. Prepare forimmediate rescue operations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready for San Francisco, Mister Whalen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Lwaxana, it is something of a rather delicatesituation> It's the first real contact with a rather reclusiverace, and this is in the nature of an official greeting, so <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing would be served by killing the Arbiter before hisdecision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I give you my word. When we arrive at the Starbase, I will makeevery effort to find him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any progress, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? Whatabout the lives that have already been lost? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Counsellor, if I were to leave theEnterprise, would its attention still be focused on me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by a moment on that. Wesley. Wes. Are you aware thatyou're acting strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over fromthe Tsiolkovsky which acts like intoxication? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course three one markseven three. Present minimalaspect. Ready warp one,optimal spread on simulatedtorpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How may we be of assistance, Ambassador? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just as at one time you did not know how to weave cloth, how tomake a bow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could this event have involved Hedril? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the planetary collision? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Situations like these are never easy, Number One. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Having Worf on board certainly has been. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is. Judge Advocate General's Report. Stardate 36764. Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard Pegasus. Basedon testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, theJudge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude thatcertain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just priorto the destruction of the Pegasus. Mutiny on a Federation starship? That's shocking. It's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, with your permission, I would like to take thisweapon back to the Enterprise to verify its origin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Data, all communication with this life form must cease. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there evidence of a hull breach? Could plasma from thestreamer have found its way into the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me what you suspect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They could be cloaked, or otherwise shielded. Mister Crusher,bring us in well clear of the planet's three moons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cheating the Nausicaans could have serious consequences for allof us. It's a risk we can't afford to take. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, return to synchronous orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, get out of there! Beverly! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me give you a hand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Coordinate your analysis with Mister La Forge. I want thisreport with dispatch. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see no reason to continue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker and I will stay on board, be available shouldyou need us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They have been monitoring me on my communicator, executing aprearrangedprogramme on her ship's computer, a fairlyingenious combination of force-field projection, holography andtransporter effects. Ardra controls her magic literally bythe blink of an eye. Centuries old technology. An implant which permitsthe movements of her eye to choose and activate each illusion. Ardra once told us that she is known by many names. Well, at least inthat she was being honest. Her crew has admitted that she is known bytwenty three aliases in this sector alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The remains of a larger vessel. He must have left in the podbefore the ship was destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Computer, continuous scan, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,vital signs. Audible readout. Begin now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, light. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By all means, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No sign of others? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we appreciate your time. You areexcused now. Mister Worf, will you bring in the next person? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I couldn't leave the Enterprise. But the offer raised in mecertain feelings of regret. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may not be back here in your lifetime. And I have to believethat you cannot be fully prepared for the realities of space travel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. The bridegroom. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A theory? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this? Thisappears quite different. What do your sensors indicate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are using your position as a Starfleet officer to affectpolitical change on your planet. There could not be a worse compromiseof our fundamental principles. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was there any evidence of life? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only from his writings. His judgments were required reading atthe Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? Or what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will rot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure that's true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon can you do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We reach Nahmi Four in twenty two hours. We'll want alltransporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic acrossthe board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to know that I am aware of your discomfort. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not cringing. I'm just acknowledging my limitations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not to worry, Everything is going to be fine. Now, this isgoing to hurt a bit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that's what they have. Status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have both allowed this to happen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's see if we can outrun them. Lieutenant La Forge, I wantmaximum warp <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. I want to see Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When the moment came to make a decision, you made the rightone. You chose to tell the truth and face the consequences. So long asyou can still do that, then you deserve to wear that uniform. And Iwill still be proud to have you as my First Officer. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Well, I suppose I'll see you then, then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three. Lock onto the science team and beamthem aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I should go. And you have an appointment tomorrow morningearly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes, thank you. But I find I'm having to rediscover thatthis is really my home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But Professor, you're not scheduled to catch the Vulcan shipfor another two days. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, get me the Sheliak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Special operations on Celtris Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you, MisterCrusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any possibility she could survive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing anyfurther. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, thisexperiment is over! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope their scout ship makes contact soon. It's not a goodidea to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making yourintentions known. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, step away from her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot believe this was not an arbitrary attack. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'mbringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that youcould possibly be just a little confused right now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you would not betalking to me now. Obviously, I wanted something else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why would he do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm that glad you approve. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A place where we can watch your people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An algorithm? Are you saying that these fragments areelements in some kind of computerprogramme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, everything is all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's your job, Commander La Forge. Determine some way to keepthe Enterprise up and running. Data, you join Commander Riker on theaway team. Find out what happened on that ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, what is the time right now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You control the shields. O'BRIEN <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, so long as they're on board this ship, I'm ahostage no matter where I am. We all are. I must find out who we'redealing with. If La Forge and Ro can attempt a rescue in short order,then let them proceed. If they can't, I will provide you with anotheropportunity. Watch for it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's an old folk melody. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, the Ansata separatists have been trying forgenerations to freed themselves from the rule of the eastern continent. If they can get the government just to acknowledge their demands, thenkidnapping your mother will have served its purpose. I think that maybe what they're after, but it may not. Frankly, Wesley, I don't care. My only concern is to get your mother back. Very shortly, we shall beleaving to have a meeting with the authorities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there others like you there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on theEnterprise. What unit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you calibrate their destination? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we had transferred all that warp power to the shields, itwould have torn the ship apart. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brainsgrow dependent on the biochips. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose this means I can look forward to a week of continualharassment on this subject? I admit, I've been feeling a littlefatigued. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are we close enough for a scan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As it was to our father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed! <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Ready phasers, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were much as my people once were. Savage, warlike. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll catch up with you there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So Gowron has come on board in order totest your claim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only if you will talk to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It'salways seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You stay behind me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lock in on this location. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose you have. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation betweenthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long until the Enterprise-C enters therift? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extend hailing frequencies, all languages, all channels. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. We will send you home to your wet sand. Picard toRiker. Bring up the lights in the lab, just a bit. Are youbetter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This goes against my better judgment. Transporter room three,lock on to shuttle one. Beam it back into it's bay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis. Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, andits unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we alladmire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I would like to presentthis token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty,Fourteenth Century. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf, lock onto Major Rakal. Transport on mycommand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a tractor beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earthrepresented civilisation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Believe what you wish. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Robert and I, we. Perhaps it's time to change all that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, make sure that your tricorder iskeeping a precise map of the route. We could very easily get lost inhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you seriously believe that the Federation will notimmediately intervene? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your tactical knowledge and experience will serve them well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already startedto make rapid progress. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Clearly, we still possess certain skills. It would seem we knowhow to operate this ship. But our identities have somehow been erasedor suppressed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I learned it on a planet called Kataan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting tocommunicate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would appreciate you joining me on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previouscivilisation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to ten metres per second. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mine as well. Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report to the Phaser Range, please <eos> <bos> PICARD: But they've not fired. Let's try them again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't stop them. I can't. I can't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono? Jono, where are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, this is Captain Picard. I am prepared to discussthis situation. There is no need for further violence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because of her relationship with me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to contact my ship to let Commander Riker that we'reabout to sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha died, a year before you came on the Enterprise. You nevermet her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise went through a wormhole, Doctor. It seems theentire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, I assure you <eos> <bos> PICARD: Like this hearing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is morelike the sun and the moon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They are not vermin. They are citizens of the Federation. Iwill not permit this outrage! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we report our observations how? To whom? Can you get us back? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide,here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gasto form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of thesun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's an excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the Bridge,Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elementsof its own culture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will the Cardassians cooperate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've heard of that story. It's a myth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you learn that from Commander Data as well? I shall have tohave a talk with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this what you've done to Counsellor Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley? It's good to have you back again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're wrong. If you leave, the Enterprise will be destroyed. Don't you remember? You saw it happen. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to have a word with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board theEnterprise? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn'tbelong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence farsuperior to our own? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you wish, Mister Tholl. We must get inside this panel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I think it does. It matters to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: State of the art vessel? Data, signal Parliament we'll bedelayed. We will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm a little dizzy, Number One, but none the worse. I'm onmy way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in arematch. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it's the study of fossil records at the microscopic level. I read your papers on the subject, but that was years ago. It seemed asthough the work had stopped. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In that case, make our heading nine two five mark three seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of what is he accused? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, what are you doing now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not on board my ship. I will not allow it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A singer? I look forward to reading your report, Commander. Atleast, I think I do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to Security, I want all your senior supervisors toreport to the Bridge immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security AlertPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can you be certain they're receivingus? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. Return to your position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Preparation is irrelevant. Your people will beassimilated as easily as Picard has been. Your attempt at a delay willnot be successful, Number One. We will proceed to Earth, and if youattempt to intervene, we will destroy you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're mistaken, madam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've had similar feelings. With everyone succumbing it's evenmore important that one of us attempt to keep control of his faculties. I want you to turn in, take a nap. I'll be on the Bridge. You canrelieve me in four hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not now, Doctor. Please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, let me show you what I do when I get those feelings. Comeon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By whom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think you'll like serving on board theAjax. I hear that Captain Narth is an excellent officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't know, Robert. You don't know. They took everything Iwas. They used me to kill and to destroy, and I couldn't stop them. Ishould have been able to stop them! I tried. I tried so hard, but Iwasn't strong enough. I wasn't good enough. I should have been able tostop them. I should! I should! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you say that she's just trying to do her job? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. I trust my crew, Ambassador. They will take noprovocative action unless I order them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean, now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Soon we'll both be home. First officer's log, supplemental. On the orders ofCaptain Picard, we have returned to the vicinity of the energy patterncloud. I am personally convinced that something from this cloud nowshares the Captain's mind. But there seems to be nothing we can do, atleast within regulations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The necklace. It broke. I saw it in the cargo freighter, on thefloor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It'swhole. How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened to the test ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, can you hear me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable, K'mpec. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's only possible use could be as aweapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have a number of questions for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. It would put the Federation in a very difficultposition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kevin and Rishon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you say the couple is incapable of sustainingthemselves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilian population inthe Demilitarised Zone is in a very difficult situation, but evensympathy has to end at some point. The peace treaty isn't just a pieceof paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it couldmean hundreds of thousands of lives. Two years ago, Starfleet wouldnever have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot ofconfidence in you now. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I've just spoken with Starfleet. The Hera is missing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'mpec. May we have a short recess? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you requireany assistance, then the Enterprise is at your disposal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's your choice, Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume the Vorgons have proof to back up their claim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vash. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what do I have to offer Orta that might persuade him tocooperate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As do I. I would be willing to consider releasing Lal and Datato you so that he may continue his work with her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Limit targets to engines and shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We do need you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Kriosians have authorised me to make several compromisesfavourable to your position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They'll have to learn to live with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Preliminary to what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a ruse, designed to throw us off the track. Look at theclues. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, the computer clock, thetransporter trace. All indicate the existence of a missing day. Lieutenant Worf's broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awakeand aware for that day, possibly in a struggle for our lives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. Captain's log, stardate 46693.1. We have enteredthe Bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate theFederation outpost on the third planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The isolinear chips were definitelyaltered? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have access to it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready photon torpedoes. BURKE <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, will the injectors come back online? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. You have an important job to do here. If we are to freeyour mother, then we have to be able to trace the movements of theterrorists. I want you to work with the team that are investigatingthis new technology of theirs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what if you begin to change? What if you feelcompelled to go down to the planet like the others? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But that, too, would be interference. You must progress in yourown way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you have hurt any of my people Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the good ones never get them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you lock on to her coordinates? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Punished? How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And we will have it again, Number One. I have been studying theIconians since I was a cadet. I have to be the one to go. TheEnterprise is yours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf wants you to live. The name of your father must someday becleared. He needs you alive with your honour intact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activateprogramme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For the eight hundred years people have been trying to solveit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation hasdeveloped. Mordan Four has finally gained peace after decades of civilwar <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reduce engine power. Tractor beam off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's your situation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with,largely thanks to Captain Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long have you served on board theEnterprise, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that will take some time to explain. Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forgehas managed to disable the alien transformationprogramme. Starfleet hasdispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And a wonderful job you did of it, too. Well, later thisafternoon, we're going to finish the tour I promised you, starting withthe battle bridge. I'll see you at fourteen hundred hours. You have theBridge, Number One. + <eos> <bos> PICARD: None that I can see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is penetration possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You made decisions you felt would save your colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have my complete support. You know that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Data. What are his limits? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The people involved in this are of the highest calibre. If Ididn't believe in their loyalty, I wouldn't have gone this far. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that what made the Aldeans sterile? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, have a seat. You see, I'm just not convinced that youare telling the truth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I wouldprefer to make the initial contact myself. I'm sure you would, if thesituation were reversed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're not dead. Communication is down, that's all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's sound advice at any time, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for thiswitness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Biogenic weapons, for example. You could provide them withintelligence that would show that the Cardassians are, in fact,supplying their colonists with them. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: We know from our own experience that our shields will protectus. So long as we're in no danger, I will make every effort tocommunicate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Korris. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What planet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When his family was killed, how did he take it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Number One, those big clamps are part of theemergency system. If something goes wrong, they're designed to hold theturbolift in place. But it would seem that they're damaged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was personal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Caused by? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money. Captain's log, supplemental. We have received wordfrom Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will beattacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position inthe Hugora Nebula to wait for them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative ofthe Federation, I require an explanation. Why has this child been heldin your custody for so many years? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what would you say if I were to tell you that she has nopowers whatsoever? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you see if those clamps are attached to long beams insidebig grooves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I should say you should, Commander. Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So dangerous, Mister Worf, that he could have destroyed us inan instant had he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep clear ofhm. I want him to understand we mean him no harm <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you had tell me as much as possible prior to hisarrival, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, you kept the name. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll only tell that when we see his behaviour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, this ship is less than a year out of Spacedock. What arethe chances of this occurring? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Raise all shields, phasers at ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are the survey preparations coming along? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll see what I can do. And now, if you will excuse me, I'msure the two of you have a lot to talk about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have two choices. Either way, one version of history oranother will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one. Now who is to say which is better? What I do know is here, today, oneway, millions of lives could be saved. Nowisn't that incentive enough? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lutan, you have granted us hospitality and the safety of yourCentreplace]. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thankyou. And now, according with the customs of your ancestors, whom wehonour and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return ofLieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you let us help you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in a new course. I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I did not come here to discuss your wife. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Raise shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard theEnterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you suggest we proceed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is the second time you have accused me of speaking withanother man's voice. It's true he will always be a part of me. Hisexperiences, his spirit. But I speak with my own voice, not his. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative. Nothing goes out without specific orders from me. Hopefully the delay will be minimal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're the woman he was talking about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have only Doctor Kingsley's assurance that these childrenare not infected, whereas we have seen the results of this diseasefirst hand. In a case like this, I think we should err on the side ofcaution. PULASKI <eos> <bos> PICARD: He destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken thesample. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you made any progress, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Energise the network. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I like climbing. There's something about actually having yourfate in your own hands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and who she ischanges the moment the next mancomes into the room.  And I find myself hoping that the nextman won't come in. But, ofcourse, he does, and in a few hours, the ceremony will begin and shewill mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than hecares about her. And I can't help thinking how she will be with him. How she will change to accommodate him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am deeply concerned by what is happening here. It began whenwe apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answerfor his crime. But the hunt didn't end there. Another man, Mister SimonTarses, was brought to trial and it was a trial, no matter what otherschoose to call it. A trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothingsubstantive offered against Mister Tarses, much less proven. MisterTarses' grandfather is Romulan, and for that reason his career nowstands in ruins. Have we become so fearful? Have we become so cowardlythat we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a currentenemy? Admiral, let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else,because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocentassociations. I implore you, do not continue with this proceeding. Endit now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, set course for Loren Three, maximum warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think we are in danger from this plague? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's your real fear. Never to die. Neveragain to be united with those who left you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't I hear anything about a launching? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ten Forward, you must release these peopleso that they can receive proper medical attention. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Think of giving him some of yourstrength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Wesley. You remember I was always proud of you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to Riker, stand by. Signs of consciousness? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Be specific. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keeping me a prisoner here will not compel me to discussanything with you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want some better options. Data, Geordi, take Doctor Rabal andbegin an analysis of the rift. We need to find some way to get theFleming out of there. Second Officer's log, stardate 47312.1. Our newsensor readings have greatly improved our understanding of the rift. However, we have been unable to find any way to counteract it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Turbolift Control, do you read? This is the Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Taguans were to catch you down there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, do whatever is necessary to override theinterference. Let's complete our mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would be a bit hard to explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a Starfleet tradition that atsocial gatherings, disputes are not permitted. I hereby declaretherefore all disagreements resolved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you are my First Officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's our ETA? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He understood. We should have access very soon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That takes care of the practical, but there's more to growingup than that. It's my belief, Number One, that you're best qualified tosupervise that. Are you willing to serve? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergencysaucer separation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. Very well done, Data. Your performance skillsreally are improving. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary! <eos> <bos> PICARD: On whose authority? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, withMasaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the condition of the alien ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a twenty-fourth century mysteryI have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so I canget a power boost? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn! I'll call the Doctor again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever game you want to play will have to wait untiltomorrow. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I read that, too. Lieutenant Yar, what do your sensors show? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will proceed according to the traditions and the precedentsset down in Klingon law. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What will you do now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear me? Please respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, call it an extended loan. Since you lost your ship savingours, it seemed only fair. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was just part of my memory. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have a good idea. We're ready to transport down to thesurface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us back on a course <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My staff and I were brought here by an old adversary of minenamed Q, and I'll tell you the rest of that once we're safe. Come, we don't have much time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Brekkians claim it belongs to them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talkabout running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on theagricultural areas. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of the others? They'llall die when the cargo bay hatch is blown. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything we can do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Holodeck three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase two nineteen. AdviseAdmiral Nakamura I'll be a little later than I thought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely you wish to live like the rest of us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just as you fear me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Helm, move us into a higher orbit so that we may keep thesurface of the planet under surveillance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goss has fired a missile at the wormhole. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, you can't just resign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what are you doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My answer is still no. My lecture will have to stand on itsown. Now, will you please leave my ship. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Move to within five kilometres. Mister La Forge, prepareto extend <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you like some tea? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where else would I be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek, we're a part of each other. I know that he has causedyou pain but I also know that you love him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum. I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probablyinitiated over a thousand years ago. Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived atOrelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars andPromellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we havefound a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood thecenturies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return environmental conditions to normal, Mister Data. Move inyour security teams, Mister Worf. WORF <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will not be easy, but with Admiral Necheyev's support, Ithink they will go along with it in the end. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dirgo! <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it puzzles me. If you feel that way for Tasha, why have youchallenged her to a fight to the death? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now access the file. Start the transfer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, where is Admiral Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're sure this is going to work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course for the Kallisko. Mister Riker, prepare anaway team. Captain's log, stardate 45125.7. An away team ledby Commander Riker has conducted a thorough survey of the alien shipKallisko, and has returned to the Enterprise to report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Worf. Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The profit, DaiMon Tarr, of saving all our lives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close rangefrom a camouflaged observation post. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Recommendation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we facedeath. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis andcancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time that I wasgoing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh yes, I know. I'll get it seen to, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's also an arch-criminal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion has something to do withthis. It could have affected him more profoundly than we realise. Either way, we have to find him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, if he must, but I fail to understand how a five footandroid with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten mencan be called a child. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Change course to intercept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like to take a closer look at those readings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try them again. Boost the signal strength. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know what a court martial would mean? Your career inStarfleet would be finished. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A highwayman. It's a robber who attacks travellers, but nonehave been reported in this vicinity for centuries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could it be that grandfather analogy that Graves planted in hishead?. Data is an orphan in a manner of speaking. Is it possible thatthe loss of Graves might have affected him? Touched him on someemotional level we didn't know he possessed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf and I detected the same scent when we bumpedinto your son at the Holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He might have killed all of us. And I believe he was actingunder direct orders, Baran. You betrayed us. This has gone far enough. I think it is time that we had a new commander. Someone who will leadus to those profits that we've been promised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hardly, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's over, Baran. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, report to Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is the energy being used. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could your Visor device have malfunctioned? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me about Masaka. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A revolving door? Number One, proceed withcaution. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course, you're giving thanks for your food. I'd forgottenabout that. I wonder how many other cultures have similar customs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened between your people and the Borg? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When did you first become aware of them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do Iask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday onCorsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of athousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believethat if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is myfuture and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain andadvise him that Mister Data and I will be transporting over shortly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello. It's good to see you again. What brings you to theBridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumedby your own pain. Believing your own lies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I insist we do whatever we can todiscourage the perception of this new android as a child. It is not achild. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. Do tell us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The last time I saw Admiral Quinn he tried to warn me about asubversion within the Federation. Then Walker tried, and he's dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any word from Starfleet Command, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thelusian flu? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is what I want to do, but we have less than an hour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps there's a way that we could give you an advantage. Away of keeping you conscious after they have taken you. Doctor, can youdevelop some counter-agent to the neuro-sedative that they have beengiving the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we actually talk to them yet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what the reports said about Mendez and Hickman beforethey disappeared. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your Honour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't suppose so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try and raise her, Mister Crusher. Tell them we're only minutesaway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a trap. Comeon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you wish, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD:  <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long until we reach the Fleming? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, key access four one two mark eight zero. Picard,Jean-Luc. Starfleet priority code Gamma. Decode. Begin message. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I think we can resume the sequence. Counsellor Troi istaking care of the situation on deck seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, what are your plans? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Correct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indicationsthat this condition is spreading. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Situation, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we have one thing in common. Do you think that Orta wouldcooperate with us to determine the truth here? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't denying that it may be necessary to fire on it. But Ilook on that as a last resort. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does that programme tell you about what you're doing toGeordi? About what you and Lore are doing to the Borg? It tells youthat these things are wrong, doesn't it, Data? So how can actions thatare wrong lead to a greater good? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a Borg identification. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume original course and speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you know enough about Borg programming toalter the pathways to their root command structure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps there's a residue of humanity in Q after all. Ensign,en Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomalywith the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it inthree different time periods! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe that. I would accompany you to toSickbay, but I doubt if that would do us any good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, the Homeric Hymns. One of the root metaphors of our ownculture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, reconfigure working thrusters to manual input. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a force field at your location. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever itis you're doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resistance is futile. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I wastalking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. Iwas in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sort them out, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That woman. She would. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a bloodtest taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that be used tofilter out the genetic changes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Her name was Corlina. I'd arranged to take her out today, andthen she discovered that I had already made a second date with anotherwoman called, er, Penny, and Corlina was naturally upset. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? What are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've seen it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Escape? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And, you know, there's still a part of me that cannot acceptthat Q would give me a second chance, or that he would demonstrate somuch compassion. And if it was Q, I owe him a debt of gratitude. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewscreen. I'm Captain Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm standing directly in front of the gate. To my left there isa small triangular screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, give me status on power recovery. Engineering,come in. Why aren't they answering? La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. What is emanating here is having repercussions light yearsaway, maybe even further. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doesn't it seem strange to you that there have been two Borgattacks and the Enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are the specimens ready for transfer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf, what would be the impact of lowering theshields long enough to get the away team out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has it been that apparent? How well you know me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The reception seems to be going well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I may have to take us out of the nebula. Iwant all the power you can give me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by deflector shield. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Temba, his arms open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I think I'll be leaving. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. If you care to join us, we have a well-proventransporter device <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's no pain. It would appear I don't have any broken ribsafter all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stunsetting? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meanwhile, you can sit here and learn something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't you understand? The Bringloidi can help you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our guests will be leaving shortly. I need an emergency medicalteam down here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Irrelevant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no, there's something's wrong here. Now, Beverly, this ismore than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand. Tellme, why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, see if there's any way we can do to cut throughthe interference and beam them out of there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Show me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it's possible. Communication, understanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, Mister La Forge. We're going to execute a nearwarp <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beyond this place there be dragons. It's even said that crewsthreatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused toturn back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still, it felt good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is it, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I shall want an answer to that. I'm sure the Tanugans will too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker. On my signal, we willgamma-irradiate all computer systems throughout the Enterprise. Let'sput an end to this conflict. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, any woman who can beat a Ferengi at his own game bearswatching. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not this time, Will. I want you on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, perhaps it's still alive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor. Sit down. Look, this perhaps may be nothings, butI've been feeling a bit odd of late. Fatigued. And now I've got thisdamned headache. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, welcome home. First Officer's log, stardate 4124.5. We have foundData's home to be a completely dead world made out of lifelessvegetation. No insects, not even soil bacteria. What is it that couldkill everything on an entire planet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, your ship was adrift, your communications inoperative. We were attempting to assess your status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek and I share a particular bond. Our lives touched in anunusual way. I admit I feel the effects of his death. The tenor of thismission has changed, Mister Data, at least it has for me. We were sentto confront Spock about his disappearance. Now, I also have to tell himthat his father is dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sometimes, Riker, the best way to win a fight is not to bethere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Later, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I come in? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Successful? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interrogate him here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps later, Lwaxana. Mister Data and I were just about toshow Reittan Grax the er, the er, the new door mechanisms on the aftturbolifts. If you'll excuse us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Ambassador, I will ask our Chief Security officer,Lieutenant Worf, to make a report <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tomalak, how is it possible you didn't know of the secondRomulan on Galorndon Core? <eos> <bos> PICARD: School project? Just how far have these things evolved? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The pain's gone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Sarek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there something more, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Mendak, you have taken our Ambassador captive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you don't know how to align a control coil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your colony was attacked by a warship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl'sprotector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personalrelationships of those under my command, but in this case. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, stop, everyone. Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we begin a power transfer, can we restore life supportsystems to that compartment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I speak as a Starfleet officer, and I cannot ignore the risksto you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, we have recovered one of your survivors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, where else on this planet can I find someone she cannotintimidate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innardsbecoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Out with what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One Doctor Crusher has some livevaccine bacilli to be delivered to Tagra. It'll have to be shipped in astasis field. Will you make the arrangements? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't know that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Targeted for what? By whom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. Exit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It wasn't this bad. But it's getting worse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly ofyou. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down toAltair Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. Thank you, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'll take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it. Mister Data,you're with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the Jovis. I want to speak with Kivas Fajo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's nothing, it's superficial. What happened to Deanna? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did they attack the Yamato? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must betwo hundred metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But Idon't think that it really is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, where are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We found that world uninhabited. The life forms we left therehad, had sought the challenge. At least, that is the basic reason. Hadsought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there. Life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself aswidely as possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Elbrun, one of the reasons I'm asking you to workclosely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardlytrivial. And yet <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. It's the first time in almost twenty years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was moreconcerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the missionthan with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of themarks of a good officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, where are they now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have manipulated the circumstances with the skill of aRomulan. My decision will be announced at high sun tomorrow. Excellenttea. Good day, ladies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's get a little more information first. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the Bynars, and you're part of this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me more about this One. Does he have a name? Is he calledHugh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has tried every technical means at our disposal to reachthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll go through the gate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. During my sophomore year, I was assigned to trainingon Morikin Seven. Well, there was a Nausicaan outpost on one of theoutlying asteroids, and one day <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

That is an order, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I want Lieutenant Worf to accompany you. Getme a full report on the prospects of getting our shields back. NumberOne, Mister Data, will you join me in the conference room as soon aspossible. It's time to discuss the future of this mission, if therestill is one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fog. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not adecision I can make quickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course to Algeron Four, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that they're still alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see four lights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send yourregrets. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data attacked Counsellor Troi because he saw a mouth on hershoulder. And in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of that, I have absolutely no doubt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And it's your belief that this is what made it possible forthem to construct this base to Starfleet standards? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, if that ship has travelled into the future, we couldbe dealing with variables that will alter the flow of our history. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, we'll be arriving at Starbase one three three in a fewhours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your service to this ship has been exemplary. I don't want tolose you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your moon has begun moving toward its perigee. We're preparedto make our attempt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Conduct an intensive scan of the area. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp eight. Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we'reabout to face a challenge. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we move the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, but I would not act solely on the basis of herinstinct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, do you remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Do youremember what you were like then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed withour mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right inthinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I doubt it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Divert emergency life support to those decks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain's log <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who were in danger? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps my Chief Engineer could be of assistance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what is this place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're controlling him, and you've corrupted the Borg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you dosomething like that again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How current is this information, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hate it when you do that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And something else that's circling your world. It's veryimportant to us, and perhaps to you, to know what it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evacuated? Was the condition that critical? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Probably conquered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's odd. There's a seven year gap. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Interesting question. How long to prepare to die? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you determine what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I am still havingdifficulty controlling the shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Changing course new heading two nine nine mark zero two nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, as Captain of the starship Enterprise, I ask you not tomake that sound. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On a count of three. Stand by on phasers. One, set warp tonine. Two, divert shield power to the main engines. Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in a standard search pattern. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How about that, Data? He won't even let you talk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This tranquilliser should keep himunconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So far off course? DATA <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. Thrusters only. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kill the lights in the medical lab, Mister La Forge. Let's seeif darkness will neutralise it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. When can that be arranged? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish, I can see that they're informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought I'd take some light reading in case I got bored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Emergency. Full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our orders are to penetrate the Celtris Three installation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That question is irrelevant here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulsepower, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A private consulting investigator, Data, who solves crimes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Byleth, this is Commander William Riker, my FirstOffice, from the planet Earth. He has been assigned to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Phaser. Destroy the sphere. Destroy the sphere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall,Wesley, you took it very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's see if they'll answer our hail now, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Metaphysics? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's part of being human, Jono. But, as deeply as you can feelhurt, you can also feel joy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I admit I probably would. And perhaps I should re-evaluatethat behaviour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is your diversion, Number One, not mine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, contact the Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker tomeet us at the rendezvous point as soon as possible. Have him scan theregion for temporal anomalies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, the transport ship Denver has struck a gravitic mine left over from the Cardassian war. They've sustained heavy damage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm familiar with the practice of the feast before thetransfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made morepalatable choices. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're running out of time. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve themand their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That'll be all, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to go look for the shuttle myself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well that's fine, but where's Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's put all this together. Lieutenant Worf, multiple image,full conference mode. Let them all see each other. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you in charge here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which would suggest what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So there are limits to her power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My turn? No, I'm not much of a story teller. Besides, youwouldn't understand. Shaka. when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn'tmatter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancientone, from Earth. I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king. Gilgamesh, a king, at Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made themangry. They cried out aloud, send us a companion for our king. Spare usfrom his madness. Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city. They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgameshdefeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu atUruk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The lift's falling! Hang on! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stop! I cannot allow you to interfere with the operation ofthis ship. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, estimated arrival time at the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Activate the transporter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, answer the First Officer's question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's go through all this again. You were sitting there. Therest of us were here. Describe the exact moment when we appeared tofreeze. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forget your previous error, Mister Worf. There is no way youcould have prevented it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Absolutely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trustme. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child buildingthose model starship engines. They were well worth it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my ready room. The seven people on that ship are our firstpriority. Is the probe ready for launch? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock onto the away team, prepare tobeam them back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is Q? If you have any answer to any of this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now we're supplying the devices with the energy to kill us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. Wehave engaged the Borg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what is it you want? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was the date when you crashed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, there will be a short delay. Korris has escaped. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any response from Aldea, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much danger from that star? Worse case. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please identify yourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You need some rest, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you definitely established that there's someone's insideit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation. Your company is much appreciated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'mpec, you cannot possibly be serious. A Federation officerhas no business in <eos> <bos> PICARD: That still won't give us control of the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know thatthe unknown is what brings us out here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mute it, Mister Data. With that storm activity down there, itisn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet that wehave solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wonderful. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jared, tell your people, if the hostages are released, I amprepared to offer Federation assistance should this, this Ardra return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Loquel, Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to StarfleetAcademy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. But his judgment <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, he can't make the journey you're asking of him. You want him to go from contemplating suicide to accepting his condition and living with the disability, but it's too far. The road between covers a lifetime of values, beliefs. He can't do it, Beverly. But perhaps he can come part of the way. Maybe he can be persuaded to forgo the ritual in order to take the chance at regaining the kind of life he needs. A Klingon may not be good at accepting defeat, but he knows all about taking risks. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A Captain does not reveal his personal feelings with his crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, indeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Consider it done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You are toremain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of thisvoyage. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bach, the third Brandenburg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn. Mister Data, are your sensors picking up anything? Youshould be detecting a disturbance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't even know what I want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to leave Commander Riker to assist in your searchfor Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will not arrive in your star system for at least threeweeks. That will give us plenty of time to discuss this further. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah'sstandards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read yourlast novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, butfor the rest I <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She is trying to put an end to all that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Expected duration? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I remember. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's an emotional response, Will. We can't afford it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Captain is fine, thank you. Mister Data has beenbriefing me on the away team's comportment, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Commander Riker and an away team will join youshortly. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was curious. I meant no harm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we wereresponding to a warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up! Full reverse. Now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: As I understand it, Karnas, you were the one who demanded theweapons to avenge your father's death. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, I think I've found it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm certain, Number One. I want you to stay close. Keep youreye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving hima full medical examination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you tell if it was built by the Borg? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't get the story of Gulliver out of myhead. Overpowered by Lilliputians. How long do we have to wait? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting like somekind of escort? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we're agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Origin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal thisrupture? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement forStarfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around findinghow and why the life form there built it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trespassing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I also once asked you if you were doing this of your ownaccord. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Play back the Captain's last entry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems we're looking a unique phenomenon. One that hasn'tbeen recorded before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Voval! I thought you were dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is regrettable. A lot more people are going to die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At Lashmir? Was it like this at Lashmir? A similar situation tothe one we're facing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That can be arranged. Mister Worf, arm phaserbanks and photon torpedoes. If Lwaxana Troi is not in my arms in tenseconds, throw everything you've got at the Krayton. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what information can you give us about the inhabitants ofthis system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's no way round it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay those orders, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prophecies? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Immediately. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not nearly enough, I suppose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not now, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Ah, Number One. Look at this. Ever since we left the LimaSierra system, I have been puzzling over how the third planet couldmaintain such an orbit, when it is theoretically impossible. Butconsider this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There'll be no more punishment on this ship. Now, do yourduties and I'll see to it that we complete our mission and get ourpayment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Failed? Voval, what is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I consider this time well spent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And now, attempt to concentrate completelyon your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on hiswell being. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirtyminutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're damned right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we go to warp speed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I may not show my feelings to my crew, but I do have them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's asking for your help because you're his friend. That means that you're going to have to make your decision based on that friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will continue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Further contamination must be prevented. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, are all systems back online? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've diverted the reserve power to thefamily decks. They'll last longest. Is there anything else we can do,Doctor? Where's Wesley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then find it. A ruling with such broad ranging implicationsmust be supported. Phillipa, I hope you will use the same zeal that youdid in the Stargazer court martial. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course to intercept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard, Gowron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Find him. Get him up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Run a level one diagnostic series. Come. I want a computerthat's one hundred percent to expedite Doctor Stubbs' experiment. Aswell as the food slots in Sickbay. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think you are aware of your situation, or of how muchtime has passed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently, his squadron was practicing on the Academy flightrange near Saturn. they were flying a close formation. There was acollision. All five ships were destroyed. Four of the cadets managed totransport out. One didn't make it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enjoy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can. We have learned that if we uncouple thetransporter's Heisenberg Compensators and allow them to re-scramblerandomly, we can beam a holodeck object or a person off the grid withall of the cohesion of conventional matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All shields to maximum. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sure you don't want to try? It's very relaxing. We can find yousomething that will be quiet and gentle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, get your team back up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I require a cloaked vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome you in peace to the Enterprise, DaiMon Bok. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My name is Kamin? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

We're on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, handle the transporter. Go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not forgetting that. That's the reason he's here and not inthe brig. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's perfectly normal among the Trill. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we're here! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You choose not to answer? But you've already given an answer tothe inquiry, and that answer was a lie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He asks your forgiveness. This conflict was started by mistakeson both sides. Let's agree to end it here and now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any particular reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or at least what fields you're not interested in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's all right. It's all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! Do nothing he demands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, tell me from the beginning exactly what happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was selfish. I thought I wouldn't see you again. I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I need to talk to a parent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Override. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange, that an obscure planet several hundred light yearsfrom here should be picked up by the probe. Data, did you take thisimage from the ship's library and programme the probe to send it backto us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomalysomehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which you do very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The good news, however, is that the cease fire seems to beholding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grandpa? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, but it sounds as if with a great deal of hard workand courage, your ancestors changed this world all by themselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Didn't anyone tell you weapons aren't allowed on Risa? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf went down. I don't know if he's aliveor dead. And there were other casualties. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A long time to be alone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I shall appoint you my executive officer in charge ofradishes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The metamorph. Kamala. I've spent quite a lot of time with herthe past few days, and you're right about several things, but, Beverly,her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment and sheintends to go through with it to help her people end the war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Maybe now we'll get some answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fascinating! The entire crew going out of control, <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are many things about her species we can't easilyexplained. Yet it is very possible she is correct. A ship from the pasthas travelled through time. How can we know what effect those eventswill have on the present. Indeed, we shall never know for certain, ifGuinan is correct. But I have decided the consequences of thatpossibility are too grave to ignore. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A toast to the success of the trade conference, Reittan. I mustadmit, I had some doubts when you invited the Ferengi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not necessary, Mister Data. Meeting adjourned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face himalone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we see into the lab yet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The holodeck has been able to give us woodlands and ski slopes,figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact,but you, you're very different. You adapt. You spoke to me in French. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advancedtechnological society could have built that object out there. Theseartefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's general policy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q would never bother with contracts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Medical ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, we're beaming over a replacement coil. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't that what I ordered? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I need those logs. Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have a feeling they will choose to. Mister Crusher, setcoordinates for Starbase Lya Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We'llstay on this course until we have reason to change it. But let's doeverything we can to avoid the collision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, do your best. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is an understatement, Data. Is it possible that someone orsomething could have affected you without your knowing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen, Tog, I must possesses Lwaxana. And if that meansdestroying your ship in the process, so be it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Data. We'll go see Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Let's see if they've spotted us. Magnification, one hundred. Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've got long trip. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transportthe Boraalans? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a very human perspective, Will. For a Klingon in Worf's position, his life is over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had this one Nausicaan down in this somewhat deviousjoint-lock when, unbeknownst to me, one of his chums drew his weaponand impaled me through the back. Curious sensation, actually. Not muchpain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal sticking throughmy chest. A certain giddy warmth. In fact I do actually remember that Ilaughed out loud. Well, it pierced my heart, of course. Well, if we'dnot been so near to a medical facility, I would surely have died. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It appears that I am not immune to the strange forces that areat work on this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, all right. Have Commander LaForge transport a stasisunit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it tostore tissue samples. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But why bring such a powerful weapon into the past? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire all weapons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I came to invite you, and your husband if he is available, to aMozart recital this evening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no. No Earth ship of that time could have travelled outthis far. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beam them straight to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, incomingwounded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka. He seemedeager for his fate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever that freighter was carrying, they certainly didn'twant it to reach us. Are you sure you don't know what it was? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A life form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right nowinside Counsellor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to bedone about this very unusual situation. Discussion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Yes. Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is she all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan, I don't know why you are involved in this, but <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do you say that, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed of climbinginside the bottle? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I don't. It just saddens me to see you burdened with theknowledge things you can't change. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you would like to make one final inspectionof the unit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course you were, DaiMon. But you're still holding LwaxanaTroi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, this vessel is about to undergo extensiverepairs requiring my personal supervision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The subspace signal the probe detected? The ionisationdisturbances? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. Captain's log, supplemental. The inorganic lifeform from Velara Three has apparently taken over our Medical Lab. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor Galen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seemsour Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the matter of the unidentified subspace radio emissions,and the ionisationdisturbances? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gibberish? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set a course, warp six. Mister Worf, send a message bysubspace. Tell them to prepare for a rendezvous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Close channel. And get me that treaty. They've been beating usover the head with it for three days. Let's see if we can't findsomething in it that we can turn to our own advantage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for the nearest starbase. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like you all to put together a research proposal forthe Science Council. I'll give it my full recommendation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want, Q? You state your business. Get on with it. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But theProfessor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices insidethe one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voiceinside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The man is dying. And it's my honour to tell him that his sonmay have betrayed the Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to theKhitomer massacre, one who has new evidence, K'mpec. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: AF. Just an acquaintance of mine. Wesley, if youmeet someone whose initials you might want to carve into that elm tree,don't let it interfere with your studies. I failed organic chemistrybecause of AF. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Go to Yellow Alert. Transmit friendly greetings,all languages, all frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myselfwith children. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Number One, is the entire crew aware of this littlescheme to send me off on holiday? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Found something? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will address me as Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to find some way to undo what he has done so that wecan regain control of this ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Brull, will you show Mister Crusher thecourse to set to the Hromi Cluster? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is remarkable. Why don't you play something? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's enough, Data. Have you been able to learn more specificsabout the Manheim project? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And they have picked up indications of an intelligent lifeform, though nothing confirmed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Hitler on the move. Roosevelt pressesCongress for British aid. DiMaggio streak reaches thirty seven? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's because there is no a wormhole. There never was. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arming these people is a violation of everything that theFederation stands for. Even you cannot be blind to that. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: There it is. SS Mariposa, loaded 27th November, 2123. Destination Ficus sector. Captain Walter Granger, commanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase power to the shields. Hold us here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Believe me, it would give me great pleasure, but there isnothing I can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, whether he wants us or not. DirectorMandl, unless you're absolutely refusing permission for us to land atyour station, prepare to receive our away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose it's an understandable progression. Computers makedecisions based on inputs and we humans give off a multitude of subtlesigns that communicate our emotions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then get unstuck and continue with the briefing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring us out of warp, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's true, I don't fully understand Talarians. But you are notTalarian. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, get us to Daled as quickly aspossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not a task that I'm looking forward to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You took this weapon from the rebels? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Bajorans did not attack Solarion Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyondGalaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude thatcan possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigationsensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from wherewe were? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of disturbance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: When she comes aboard take her into custody. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's keeping them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, are you ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived momentsafter you left? That he insisted that I come here to look for you? ThatI find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? That's very good timing,don't you think? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, quickly. If the changes in Doctor Pulaski's werereversed, would it be possible <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand and I respect your people's long journey, but Ibelieve that I can help you to find a new home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Search theoretical. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Borg's entire existence was centred around acquiringcultures and technology. If that's changed, then they must have a newobjective. We have to find out what it is. Mister Worf, from thismoment on, I want to maintain a level two security alert. Post armedofficers on every deck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, did you hear what I said? All the twenty six men andwomen aboard that ship were dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are hereby requested and required torelinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, CommandingOfficer Cairo, as of this date. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about Durken? <eos> <bos> PICARD: An enormous amount of data is being received and stored in themain computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long will we be on impulse power? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer areincompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time ofwar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is the boy now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space. Let's see what they've stored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, that's true. I'm not Ardra. but I can create tremors justas she did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll follow. You go now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, the Master of Tarquin Hill designed ceramic objects thatwere three hundred years ahead of their time. All we know of him is thework. His name has never been discovered. This object is over twelvethousand years old. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course you are concerned, Gul Macet. It is precisely becauseof that fact that I have included you in every aspect of our effort. You're present with my staff. You're hearing reports as I hear them,nothing edited, nothing withheld. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fictionwhich you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? Whatyou're offering him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in. It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love. Jeremy must come to terms with his grief. He must not cover it or hideaway from it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe isfinite. That is one of the truths that all human must learn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Consequences? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region. See ifthere are any Cardassian ships nearby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have they given any hint of what they've been waiting for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I can find my own way there. Thank you, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you will have to find evidence some way other than anautopsy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quartersimpulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, I don't know. I always imagined that she did. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only logical solution. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you certain? Yes, of course you are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If her psyche has collapsed in on itself, could accessing hermind pose any danger to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No one suggested otherwise, Counsellor. Mister Data, try toisolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps there'll be abasis for communication. Mister La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jumpas soon as you're prepared. That'll be all. Counsellor <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result ofbeing held captive by the Borg, be my guest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you predict any change in the near future? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Set a course for those stars, warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There must be. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar, how do you intend to achieve this rest that youso desire? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're going to deny us travel through space? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How serious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was necessary. Do you know what thatis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to thehostile to blind it at the moment we separate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life form reading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and theold man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into theirbelief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure. It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, aconsort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbolanywhere else.]TROI <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. Status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Without evidence of intent, Number One, it will not be a simplematter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then do it. It seems we have no alternative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do we know about the cause of these wars? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, I want you to stop this immediately! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we know that for sure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. Yes, what is it, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I suppose I had better get a case. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's it, exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you socompletely you've lost even the desire to even question it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent, La Forge. Now let's, er, let's throw them off guard. Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have something else for you, Baran. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Intense magnetic fields have a disruptiveeffect on electrical systems. Therefore we can expect communicationsinterruptions, as well as potential temporary loss of other systems. Asa precaution, we are now going to Yellow Alert. Stay sharp, everyone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can accommodate you, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Since you're concerned about these tests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. That's good. You see, my people once lived in caves. Andthen we learned to build huts and, in time, to build ships like thisone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Adjust speed to intercept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what about Graves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across thegalaxy. Doesn't it make it natural to assume that the originaldesigners of the puzzle should want us to find it? Why else would theyhave put the pieces in our DNA? And in turn, doesn't suggest they wouldtry to make it easy for us to find those pieces, that there might besome pattern to their distribution? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I don't see what else youcould have done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to thewishes of their Captain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kahlest, would they recognise you? Would they know who yourare? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So these introns are causing her to re-combine in anearlier configuration? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then she has done us both a disservice. I am committed topeace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, old friend. How are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is something wrong, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good Lord, no. If I was, I wouldn't have this problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's preparedto admit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Wyatt Miller. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is alot of equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it tocontact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causingthe anomaly. We have to go back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dispersal pattern, sierra. And fire! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would give me a chance to take up Doctor Langford's offerand accompany her to the ruins on Suvin Four. But to leave theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The boy was here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes, we've seen enough. You've made a sale. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No need to apologise, Ensign. We should have explained itbetter to you at your indoctrination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How critical will the losses be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Warren is here. We're doing all we can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Satie, this is Commander Data,Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's still much to do. Still so much to learn. Mister LaForge, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

We just don't have the ears for it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, do you hear me? Irepeat. Data, do you hear <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, why was this door locked from the outside? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin launch sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, Marcus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Forge, everything's alright. We'veneutralised it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Actually, we've made better time than I expected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They want us to find it. They would havekept it simple. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil am I doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That table. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult,brightening the sky forever. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what would happen if the Enterprise C were to fly backthrough it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Commander Riker tojoin me as soon as he's ready. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that might overload the field diverters protecting our keysystems. How long until the new ones are in place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try to wake him, again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not be coerced. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to lock onto the core itself, beam it intospace? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What information do you want? I don't understand the question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold your ground, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: These officers are here to assist you. Not judge, help you. Youshould make use of them. They are a valuable resource. And by the way,I respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask aquestion, rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindlyforward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to discuss with you the specific areas of ship'ssecurity that I would like <eos> <bos> PICARD: We had better disable the site to site transport function. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. So some external force was needed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The earliest was some twenty two thousand years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shuttle nine, stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, before we lose contact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down andhave a closer look. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. I want to add the Tian Nan Men, the Sutherland andthe Hermes, whether the yard superintendent says they're ready or not. Mister Data, will you select a group of experienced Enterprise officersto augment the crews of those ships. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, inform the engine room we need more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The word trust just isn't in your vocabulary, is it. Good try,nine out of ten for effort. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know. But I wanted to go riding, but I didn't have mysaddle, so I went back to get it and <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, the Bynars have stored an enormous amount of material inour computer. We need to access it. We can't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We come from several kilometres outside the city. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resume programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute,to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, what's happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Ensign, as soon as Mister Data is finished takeus to Ligos at warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what I have to find out. You're a man obsessed with whatyou do. Who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going? Kill,perhaps? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The programme has been activated. I think it's reconfiguringthe tricorder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairlineagain in the same way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's just that I don't like <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's an old friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship? The Ferengi ship that attacked me. Or is it about toattack me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, what are their sensor readings? Is that an enemyvessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't call me Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was a little surprised at the decision to put a base in forceso close to the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You let their emotion sway you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as aheadache. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We areready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess whileI review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about theexplosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuingyour investigations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reset phasers to stun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is an attitude I've found common among the best officersI've ever served with. You're not one of them yet, but you could be, ifyou work at it. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems that the exemplary nature ofyour work has caught the attention of Starfleet Command. In fact,someone is coming on board just to see the engine modifications you'vemade. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right then. Good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, get them up, now. Transporter Room]CRUSHER <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll take the alien ship to the nearest Federation starbase. Ensign, lay in a course. Captain's log, stardate 45212.1. We have deliveredthe Ktarian vessel to Starbase eighty two and are now on a course torendezvous with the Starship Merrimack, which will transport WesleyCrusher back to Starfleet Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Ro. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I can't do that either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. When they try to bring their ships through, theEnterprise and the Tian Nan Men will swing around, close the gap andcatch them in the act. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Five hundred years ago, military officers would upend a drum onthe battlefield sit at it and dispense summary justice. Decisions werequick, punishments severe, appeals denied. Those who came to a drumheadwere doomed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The preliminaries are over. All we need do now is escort theRomulan Ambassador to the final session. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami. Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, the Hera's last reported location was three hundredlight years away. How could it end up here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the Acamar system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the increase in efficiency? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said he was stationed there for six years. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Situation report, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are hereby requested and required to take command <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt atcommunication. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready, but hold on ready. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Yar's death is very painful for all of us. We willhave to deal with it as best we can for now. Until the shuttle crew issafely beamed aboard this ship, our feelings will have to wait. Is thatunderstood? Lieutenant Worf, you are now Acting Chief of Security. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam thechildren up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is there anyone else on board who servedpreviously with Captain Benjamin Maxwell? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough. Answers. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, Iwant them at a staff meeting in one hour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve that relationship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find that almost impossible to believe. That Admiral Kennellywould considersupplying weapons to the terrorists? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to stay as close to the crew aspossible. Some of them may feel uncomfortable with Cardassians onboard. I don't want any incidents. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he can't make a full recovery, Worf will to kill himself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The exocomps are siphoning power from the core. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, plot a course for Starbase two sixty, warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go onso long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that were true, what could three indicate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you have dinner with me tonight? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you were emotionally affected by the music. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then he's still in Cardassian space? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of thefield? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. A hearing, certainly. Probably a court martial. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oops. Just where does she think you're calling from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have decided to accept your proposal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but it's a correct assessment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's your evidence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Velara Three base, do you copy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ian, could you tell us why you are here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time thatshe was changing into a reptilian lifeform. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only communication that was sent werethe numbers one four zero zero. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And they would claim the leadership of the Council? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let's try it. Mister La Forge, I want you to monitorthe situation very carefully, and keep an open comm. link with theHolodeck so as to be apprised of any problems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, neither can I. Unless they're baiting some kind of trap. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll tell you what I see. If I find Toral's challenge valid,the two of you will very quickly gain control of the Council and Gowronwill be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's claim, youwill accuse me of serving Federation interests. It will serve as arallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I will be the judge of reasonable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was not informed either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight atsomething he did not want to see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why is that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'm in good company, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Would you put it back where you got it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have been contacted by the factions on Solais. They want torenew negotiations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He said he needed more time. He was upset by our early arrival. But in fact I maintain he already had made that breakthrough and thathe was lying to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leaving my career, the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would be hard to forget Mister Homn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare the shuttle for immediate departure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Premier. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren islocated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, don't babble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate full restart. Put all systems back online. <eos> <bos> PICARD: More ambience. Less substance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I can see that. I'm sure the Federation will want to helpin any way that it can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happened, Number One? Report. Report! Report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: He looks almost proto-human. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Forgive me, Jay Gordon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why wasn't I notified? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there nothing of Data in what I'm hearing? You see, youchose the violinists. Heifetz and Bronken have radically differentstyles, different techniques, yet you combined them successfully. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What would cause such a loss of control? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. I understand you're leaving for Starbase Five One Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think you will find that attitude prevalent among all theEnterprise people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, take us out of orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Answer me. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Vash. Would you have brought me here if I had toldyou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But they'll benefit from the extended time. It will allow themto acclimate before returning to Earth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The side effects of the transport? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's your choice. If you wish, you can stay on the Enterprise. We will drop you at a starbase, then you can go where you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will tell you again. Data is a valued member of my crew. Heis an outstanding Bridge officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not exactly. Nothing works just as you hope. If you can't tellus any more, I need to send a team down to the lab. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In an age when their technology should be able to clothe andfeed all of them, that they should have to live like this. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fair's fair. And let's credit his science teacher, too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Corey, I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you frommaking a serious mistake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you any idea how this happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, why haven't you left that building? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. WORF <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the risk is <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know it's hard to accept, but even the best <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we get more power to the shields? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A life form. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. Thisis a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps weshould try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehowincorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen tome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any way for us to duplicate <eos> <bos> PICARD: I remember. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you know where he is? Could he help us restore normal time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not by choice? Are you somehow being controlled by that force? Did Geordi miss something when he examined you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can it be repaired, at least enough to access the database? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who will one day be a man and, to extend the metaphor, willneed a fine edge that won't dull at the first touch of resistance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it will have to be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. Here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interestwhile I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. Do you think Iwish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see for myself the implications for theFederation? Good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! All of myinstincts, my training, my very being as a Starfleet officer are atodds with my responsibilities as Arbiter of the Klingon High Council. We walk the same tightrope between two worlds, you and I. We must tryour very best to keep those two worlds separate, or we shall certainlyfall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Options? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No, you won't. You're not a killer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course <eos> <bos> PICARD: It'll cause trouble. He's a Nausicaan. They can get veryill-tempered if they lose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It sounds as though they may require the services of a doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To avenge their deaths. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbolrepresents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyonehas a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by, Mister Worf. Have your ship lock on to your peopleand beam them out of there before something happens. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if I challenge this ruling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, will you at least allow me to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Now end the demonstration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet is not a military organisation. Its purpose isexploration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But with the disappearance of Commander Riker, wouldn't it beprudent <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the case of this group, it apparently worked. Mister Data,will you report to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what's going on here. Why are we risking our lives takingthese artefacts? Who wants them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can I find Korgano? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, who do you think you're working for? Starfleet isnot an organisation that ignores its own regulations when they becomeinconvenient. Whether you like it or not, Data does have rights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind that wheneverwe have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's timeto cooperate with them. CONDUCTOR <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I neverbelieved they could be true. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive me if I don't act surprised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When I have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growthagain. It needs must wither. Nine, eight. 'Tis better to have loved andlost than never to have loved at all. Seven, six <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Romulans wish the honour of thefirst contact, let them have it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A legacy of your Progenitors, Radue. The source of your powerand of your problems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Masaka. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not at all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume from your request for his transfer that you think he'snot, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait. If that is a Romulan ship, they will read our intent. It'll force them into taking a similar posture. We don't want to engagein battle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is information you already know. And so nothing haschanged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Against your wishes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you escort the Minister to the transporterroom? Chancellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! I never sought that rubbish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Never? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They make serious accusations against you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does the supply ship have any weapons? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've obviously brought a very dangerouslife form aboard this ship. I want to minimize the chances of anyincident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One quarter impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, we're not gods. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I remember. There were no survivors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse course. Take us back to Federation territory, warp six. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws downthere. Not permitting the Crusher boy to be executed. And by so doingdo I endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q the liar. Q the misanthrope. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. You're right, Number One. It's a task that I willattend to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you estimate the number of jumps it will take? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. Do you see any problemsconnected with this old starship coming in, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really happened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: History is aware of the role you played, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I want you to understand what my music means to me. Andwhat it means for me to be able to share it with someone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder, I'm going totry to repair these energy relays. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And were they? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, would you escort the Professor to his quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please feel free to contact me at any time. Picardout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a thriving colony on that planet. Rather than uprootthese people, may I offer a compromise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, this may prove to be a wild goose chase,but I don't see that we have any other choice, do you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you abetter understanding of love? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The cease fire has been broken. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wanted to ask you about Amanda's biological parents. Whenthey decided to remain on Earth, what was the reaction in the QContinuum? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, pick up Whalen. Take him to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A number of objects have been discovered missing in the lasttwo days, and if they're in your possession, then we would like themreturned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley! <eos> <bos> PICARD: More like a late twenty-second century interplanetary journey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're out of options. Do it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Six hour? The banquet will be completely over by then. That'svery unfortunate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But Data can understand you. Use him. Let him explain yourwords. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin long range scans of the Romulan border. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bensen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, very good. I've read all this before, you know. It'sabsolutely as it should be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prime Minister, even the most comfortable prison is a prison. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you surprised to see me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'll be too busy discussing the finer points of watermanagement with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. And they won't be carrying meon a cloud of chromal vapour. Ops. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engineering and programming. Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics ingeneral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, perhaps it would be best if you were to confineyourself to Sickbay until we arrive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. ActuallyI'm looking forward to meeting this mediator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force youto disobey his orders. Therefore I will have to remain in the dark onthis mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not letPressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that thattrust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the commandstructure of this ship. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full stop, helm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kill who? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Imprisonment is an injury, regardless of how you justify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. That's how it starts. But the road from legitimatesuspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think. Something is wrong here, Mister Worf. I don't like what we have become. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Angel One's strategic importance in this quadrant may becomevital. Starfleet's hope is that one day this world may become part ofthe Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are there any other Romulans we should be looking to recoverfrom Galorndon Core? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The test is if a crew will follow where Commander Riker leads. His joviality is the means by which he creates that loyalty. And I willmatch his command style with your statistics any time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher is still making her determination. Mister Mandl,you know the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Compensation? You have stolen our children away from theirclassrooms, away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation? You claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed anact of utter barbarity! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, end programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Au revoir, Natasha. The gathering is concluded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're sorry you came tonight? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Escape? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you admire him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, she is under the strict guidance of a woman in whom Ihave absolute trust. Ten Forward is the centre of the ship's socialactivity. Everyone on board comes here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Answer affirmative. Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A loose alliance formed in the early part of the twenty secondcentury. It was the first stirrings of worldgovernment. You should read more history, Number One. Computer, locateexact dates in which this signal beacon was in general use. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Its telemetry failed. It was never heardfrom again. Do you believe that you've discovered the remains ofColonel Richey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Aaaaardklaxon leeeeesss blag blan ar'nik ka'nik. Aaaaard krasulaaa. Rasssstrassss trasulaaaah. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A malfunction. Emotional awareness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why has everything become a something, or a whatever? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can try. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's the only chance we have of finding Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't use the replicator? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time to the Solarion system? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Bridge to Lieutenant Worf,acknowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take an away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, you can do that, but you haven't. I suspect you shook thisship in order toget my attention. Well now you have it. What is it you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That was Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign. Please follow hisinstructions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. Well, my mates and I were at the BonestellRecreation Facility, which was something of a dead rough crossroads atthe time, filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff. When atrio of Nausicaans came in, they were clearly spoiling for aconfrontation with a group of fresh-faced Starfleet officers such asourselves. Well, everyone in the group had the good sense to give theseNausicaans a wide berth, to stand off. Everyone, that is, except me. Istood toe to toe with the worst of the three, and I toldhim whatI thought of him, his pals, his planet, and I possibly made somepassing reference to his questionable parentage. And the next thing Iknew, all three of them were on me and I was fighting for my life. Iwas actually doing quite well for a while, too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. This is very wrong. Neither of you should be reacting inthis way. Computer, locate Commander Data for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can relax, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me posted, Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you access it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're prepared to grant them independence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe I have the best part of that bargain, Ambassador. Peace and long life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Go into the cockpit, and look for a small comm. panel inthe instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you find them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aldebaran whiskey. Who do you think gave it to Guinan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we will gladly explore the possibility of it with you,Mister Conor. Would you like to come aboard to discuss it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians atStarfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era. Oh,Professor. Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are our orders? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dad! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Male or female? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, get them up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might create a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When we arrive at the pulsar, I shall require everyone attheir best. I know that I can rely on both of you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by to fire torpedoes on my command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Logic fails us sometimes, Data. I think this is one of thosetimes. I can only guess that he does not see, or he does not wish tosee, the truth. And he is being insulated against that truth by thosewho love him most. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Number One, as soon as Data is ready, I want you tolead an away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, report. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. This mission can't be delayed. If you want topostpone the work? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the status of the enginereplacement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now we know there's someone out there and they're asking forhelp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite sure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we're going to trust our lives to these systems, we shouldbe certain they're not going to fail. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's right. I'm fine. What is this all about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's something else. Since his recovery, he's manifestedunusual abilities. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to losenothing, either way the challenge goes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchangebetween the Iyaaran people and the Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Always? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why don't we sit down? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. You have the wrong man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my monitor, Lieutenant. Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is not my intention to interfere. Only to help you andRishon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're all right. We're going to keep on climbing. Just don'tlook down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell Data and La Forge to do themselves a favour, and stay outof their way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scanning and recording as we go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here we go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroy the tricorder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen to me, all of you! Drop your weapons! Do it! Don't makeany aggressive movements. The resonatoramplifies violent feelings and emotions. And that's why you wanted meto pick up the phaser. That's how you were able to kill Narik andVekor. But I can see the symbol on that third artefact, and it is theVulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death. It's a warning that the power of the resonator can be overcome bypeace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are aware of that, Electorine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you will still be here. In this place. For ever. Alone. Immortal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Canyou identify whoever or whatever you are? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He may not be as useful as you think, if this is the same Rikerthat I've heard about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet haverequested that we lend a hand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you Masaka? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I understand it has unusual radioactive emissions, and I'msure that Stellar Sciences will find it a most interesting study. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are theylaughing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you do to them, Q? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Captain's prerogative. This one's mine. We have examinedevery conceivable risk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't even know what it means. The Horga'hn is for a friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it reversible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. Tasha, it's all right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's turning yellowish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Think of him as someone you caredeeply about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strike? I'll see what I can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm fine, Doctor. Save your ministrations for your patient. Iwant a staff meeting in five minutes. Doctor, I assume you will want toremain here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf will escort you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's welcome news. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon aswe're on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, you will continue with your analysis and determine thedanger, not only to our ship, but the Klingon vessel also. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long is the interval? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you found out about Uhnari? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you must unconditionally surrender. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Breakfast? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than atrip around the nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can take you directly through the structure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are indeed a leader. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you Jason Vigo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think I deliberately avoided speakingwith the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of ourplan. But now that I have, he seems to be a fully realised individual. He haseven accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me some options, Data, quickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do we know about this weapon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Council Member Vash. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've managed to avoid it for the past six years, but now itwould seem my luck has run out. I can't think of anything more tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation, uninterestingfood, boring speeches. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps some answers at last. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My word! High praise from a Vulcan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment, Captain. We've also discovered a human among yourcrew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, ready an away team. Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit aboveTurkana Four, an Earth colony that severed relations with theFederation nearly fifteen years ago. I am concerned about sending anaway team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two missingFederation crewmen, I see no alternative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Think of them as a single, collective being. There's no oneBorg who is more an individual than your arm or your leg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, see to it that the replicators provide a blanketfor every man, woman and child before nightfall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. Welcome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's my job, young man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, we have analysed your problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know how busy you are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Esoqq, how long can you go without food? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll get you some quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, you'll have to work overtime in order to catch up, but Ihave assured the Admiral that you are capable of that. Please don'tmake a liar out of me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message toLutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have nowcommitted what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you havevisited our vessel, you most certainly know thepower of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion,Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, has the boy volunteered any further information? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We sympathise with your situation. Surely there is a solutionwhich can be mutually satisfactory? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did we? Counsellor, I think it's time you took me to meetMister Conor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell is happening in Engineering? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The warbird has vanished as well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, can you give me any details? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If time is so important, why didn't they transmit the orders bysubspace? <eos> <bos> PICARD: 1941, A. D. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is wrong with me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should go now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It'll be some time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers! I'm sorry. Hewas in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortalthreat, and I let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want a staff meeting on the observation deck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen, we need to find that source if we are to defeat thiswoman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No need to report. I'm just here to do some work on my own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is Commander Riker alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because ship captains control their own vessels, young man! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a physiological cause? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ishara, I wanted to thank you personally for what you did forus down on the colony. It was more than I expected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I believe we will postpone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sunad, this individual is a guest aboard our ship. We found himdying in a shipwreck. We returned him to health. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The boy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And do you suspect that that is my intent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did you get here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope I'm not intruding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's us before we stepped into the turbolift. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is close enough, Ensign. Hold this position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you found anything yet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminalbehaviour is as unacceptable in the twenty fourth century as it was inthe nineteenth. And much harder to get away with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you keep me informed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to away team, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Prepare your away team, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not we, Number One. I want you and the others to stay hereuntil I return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That doesn't suggest a Romulan connection? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any professional reasons? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This biochemical stasis, does it suppress synaptic functions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we decode it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, you might. But that does not alter your duty to me and tothis ship. Now, do you know how to formulate a premise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not the time. Damn it, even I can see the umbilicalcord is virtually uncut. The child, the child depends on him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, Mister La Forge, increase to warp five. Sameheading. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is something to be said for a more scientific approach. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. Atfirst, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then Iwas in the past just before our first mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are ready, Radue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive,and until that is changed there is no further course of action that wecan take. Is that understood? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of chance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't that exactly what we anticipated? <eos> <bos> PICARD: She's a fine ship, Will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. How long can you stay? There's so much to talkabout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet'sunification and peace. Why should he now be unable to deal with thisrebellious faction? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They know? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could the T'Ong be disabled rather than destroyed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I care. Which is why I must see them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, it appears that severing the powertransfer has not only prevented the core breach, but has also restored <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, initiate pursuit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The uniform. It's totally inappropriate. I should have changed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you certain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which teams are missing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He knows. We all know. Will he live? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, that is a little vague. What is the computer analysis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A beacon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you don't deny it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Mister Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that couldbe a direct threat to the security of the Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. Captain's log, supplemental. Our away team hasbeamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is asaggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth hundreds of yearsago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier, larger and strongerthan the male. An arrangement considered most sensible and natural. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will not be extinguished. We will save this programme, andhopefully, in time, when we know enough, we will bring you back in aform which could leave the holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A spy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They are security officers from the twenty seventh century. They're here to take back the Uthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: By all means. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know what you're talking about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's begin with you, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would be acceptable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. But say if it were undone, would she be normalagain? <eos> <bos> PICARD: With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on boardanother unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allowthat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Comment is invited. Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have many enemies? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You also see things in a way we do not, but as they truly are. I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or any member of thisvessel be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, would you escort our guest tothe transporter room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. How's that Cardassian virus, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's called the Blue Parrot Cafe, and you're buying. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we stop it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Irrational? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why is that? What is this cargo? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The massacres in the Norkan outposts, for example. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a better choice. Lay in a course for the soliton wave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've been offered the Melbourne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whereas you, of course, have a nobler purpose in mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's excellent, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Under the circumstances, I think there is only onedecision. I will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, I ask you to put and end to this before someone gets hurt. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, reinstate holodeck three programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No reason you're aware of. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room, stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see howit can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't helpwondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to berepeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannotforesee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for amoment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll present my compliments to the crew. Oh yes, Number One,about that Horga'hn you requested. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my entirecrew is at stake, but I must be sure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, every person on that ship over there died. Is there anychance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's an old navy phrase, meaning everything in perfect order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Why was it dangerous? What is happening to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, your game was for my benefit. She is innocent in all ofthis. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where will you go? <eos> <bos> PICARD: With reason. <eos> <bos> PICARD: More than anything else, you wanted the Enterprise away fromRana, because the house, the plot of land, your very existence, wereincongruities that you were not prepared to explain. The warship,another recreation, tried to chase us away twice, and failed. But whenI came to your house the second time, I provided you with the onlycondition that would make the Enterprise leave. Your deaths. You didyour best to satisfy that condition. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. My staff will give you their full cooperation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on allfrequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander MacDuff, set a course for the Lysian Central Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, I would like you to accompany Captain Scott. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I love a mystery, Data, but this one will have to to wait untilwe deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament. Timeand tide, Lieutenant La Forge. Go to warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that the sun revolved around it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on to the intruder and transporther to the planet surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Estimated time of arrival, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. Butdespite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager torenew ties. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive this tardiness. Ship's business. Minister Campio,Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got onit. Conference evaluation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could we have? Perhaps in the short term. But to what end? Hold. Beverly, the Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is aphilosophy, and a very correct one. History has proved again and againthat whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilisation, nomatter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results areinvariably disastrous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A cloaking device? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha, no. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Full scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, ask them to identify themselves and match ourorbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exit! Computer, exit! Data, try the other exit in thehall. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not my life. I know that much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obstructing him? Then it's not yet certain. He's not yetcommitted. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site, youknow. It's a Federation outpost there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doesn't it? Our very presence may have damaged, even destroyed,their way of life. Whether or not we agree with that way of life orwhether they're human or not is irrelevant, Number One. We areresponsible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if I do find it, what then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's alright, Counsellor. Perhaps there's nothing out there tosense. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which somehow resulted in complex strings of water moleculeswhich acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain likealcohol. Data, download this information to Medical immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Ambassador's very busy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll inform the medical personnel on thoseplanets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas. I'm surethey'll appreciate knowing what <eos> <bos> PICARD: Liko! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When helost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediatelyto the beam down coordinates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To whom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I need to know what's on the shuttle's logs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've heard, Data, and I would be delighted to offer anyadvice I can on understanding women. When as I have some, I'll let youknow. Second Officer's personal log, stardate 44935.6. After conferring with my colleagues regarding the nature of romanticlove in general, and my own situation in particular, I have reached adecision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the twenty fourth century. Material needs no longerexist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your concern was justified, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course, something you learn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, cluck, cluck, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ohniaka Three? There's no strategic value to that outpost. Werethey able to identify the attackers? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It could have been damaged by the explosion. They may have beenable to maintain orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you will release them, I will take theirplace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign. It's all over me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you decode it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Yes! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mixed feelings for all of us. It's always difficult leaving anyship, just as it was for your mother <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, do you see any survivors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, Mister La Forge, prepare to beam down to theplanet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister DataDATA <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something of a tradition, Guinan. The Captain touring the shipbefore a battle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I come in? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine room just incase we need to move out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but you must have so many enemies. Certainly you knew thatonce you became mortal some of them might look you up. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Locate the exact source of the tractor beam. Lock on phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you were prepared? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps you would share them with me, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring them back. Now. Chief Herbert, what's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,DaiMon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm fully aware of your Starfleet record, your problems onother ships, and the incident on Garon Two that led to your courtmartial. And I'm concerned about your presence on this delicatemission. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, Counsellor, I just feel that I'm not the right person forthis job. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want some explanations from Lutan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's no time, Number One. Initiate the transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hmm. Well, we should get some sleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, may I see you in my Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not surprised. Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Warnthe vessel to stay clear of the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's taking a risk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. Then report to Mister Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Commander La Forge and Lieutenant Worf, escort ourguest to transporter room one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is this place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They look like cellular clusters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ginger tea with honey, eighty degrees Celsius. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has Worf found anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't be a fool, Corey. Look, there are plenty of other peopleto play dom-jot with. Now just go about your business. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of thing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, for a very good reason. Counsellor Deanna Troi is inSickbay, dying. Doctor Crusher doesn't know the cause of her condition,but I believe you do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was not necessary to abduct us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aboard a starship, that is not necessary. We are all capable ofexercising self-discipline. Now, you will refrain from using them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a few moments, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain, Enterprise. Request controlaccess Starfleet ship USS Lantree, Isao Telaka commanding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister DeSeve, in your opinion is it possible that we'repicking up a cloaked Romulan ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are the defensive capabilities of the Central Command? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something to be carefully avoided. I agree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please. You were saying about the Cardassians? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And it is against Starfleet orders to accept a surrenderotherwise. Do you withdraw your surrender? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it a life form, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I certainly don't look it. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not going to be able to determine anything from here. Weneed to get on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is ridiculous, Doctor. I have an away team down there, inless than friendly territory, and in addition I have an appointmentwith several Romulan battlecruisers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Long range scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a possibility the wound could be self-inflicted? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's just say my faith would be strengthened by a gesture fromyou, such as powering down your disruptors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulan ship will reach us within the hour. If our patientdies it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start anincident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of theFederation. Think of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The last thing I want is to be forced into destroying one oftheir ships. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why did you choose to study the concepts of authority andleadership? 4 <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sound again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I had gone with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you putting mankind on trial again? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You feel the Hathaway has value? We deny you your prize. Fire! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a trap. Come on! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Lieutenant, I cannot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's how it felt. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do your best, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. Perhaps your system of law and punishment isbetter than any system we once had. But we do now have a law I mustobey. And part of it says I must protect my people from harm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a little out of their territory. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, we have to find some way out of here. Beginscanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They wanted the best. That, according to all reports, is Riva. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We mean you no harm. We must warn you that your planet is aboutto experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellarcore fragment. No structure will be able to withstand them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. First officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprisehas moved into a synchronous orbit near the southern polar region. Weawait further instructions from Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Less than five hours. Which is why I have called you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Astonishing to see it frozen like this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are here together to honour our friendand comrade, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Coming to terms with the loss of acolleague is perhaps the most difficult tasks we must face in the workwe have chosen to pursue. We will all find time to grieve for her inthe days that are ahead, but for now she has asked that we celebrateher life with this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor. Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge forthe next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health forthese negotiations, and he might require your services. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why was there a power drain beforetransport? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Because I'm delighted you did. But, perhaps we shouldcall it a night. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, Picard. Contact the Repulse using subspacecaptain's priority channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A risk we have to take. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I said we would, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is human. The medical scans have proved that, right, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are not familiar with the terms of your claim on thissector. We're here engaged in scientific research. Do you wish toparticipate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is an order, Doctor. Now, assemble all personnel on thetransporter pad. Now! Picard to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you proposing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to know more about what happened down on Gravesworld. Lieutenant Selar, report to the Captain's ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there an intelligence causing this interference? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For what purpose? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any idea what it is or where it comes from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase power to <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you care for something? So, Beverly. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying this ship has lost nearly eighthundred of its personnel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope so. What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will this creature be able to survive on its own without theparent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased to hear that, Gul Dolak, for all of us in theFederation value the peaceful relations with our Cardassian neighbours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am not encouraging him. If you weren't so narrow minded, ifyou allowed him to see the world as it really is <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, withmyself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest inwhat happens to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am aware of that, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm okay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase to warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good guess. You're quicker than Starbase research. It took themhours to determine this was a distress beacon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then Counsellor Troi is still alive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by for transport. Picard out. Mister Worf, have allsecurity precautions been taken? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data will meet you there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, this is not simply a case of me taking theEnterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase to purge myself ofguilt and remorse. I will not let Galen's death to be in vain. Now, ifthat means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days,then so be it. I will take the full responsibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there nothing that will cure this infection? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For what reason? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, what place are you trying to reach? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chairman Songi, we will proceed immediately to your planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well. a strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm Jean-LucPicard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something youwill need if you're going to stay on Rana Four. It's a matterreplicator. It has limited capabilities, but <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds,the very touch of things, much more real than a dream. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to contact Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, what's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As soon as we are secure of this rescue operation, I'll discussall of this new power <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain to her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that how you interpret it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It sounds delightful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. His name was Joshua Albert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is he still tending grounds, or have the years finally caughtup with him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Odan, this is Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, please, Mister will do fine. Well, the overallconfiguration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. The surface ornamentation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's true, then help me. We want thesame thing. We both want the Enterprise to be safe. But there is apiece of information I don't have. What is it? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I think you had better see who's at home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, but Earth isn't likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone,or to repel a Romulan attack, It was my command which sent his motherto her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, if we're not holding the Ferengi and they're not holdingus, who the hell is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So if time and anti-time were to collide <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're right about this then perhaps we can escape the loopby avoiding the collision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you're right, perhaps we could escape the loop by avoidingthe collision. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna! Anna! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign er, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, if is passage narrows to less than five hundredmetres, I will abort the mission. You can charge me withinsubordination if you wish, but I'm not going to risk the Enterprisefor a salvage operation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your best suggestion in an hour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to stall Danar. Allow himto think he's succeeding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much longer before we reach them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in fortyhours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which is four years ago. ARomulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coilshad collapsed, life support was failing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patience. Patience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Run it again. Computer, freeze. Call up the intelligence scanof Spock on Romulus. Computer, enhance far left figure and compare. Same man. Pardek. One question answered. What do we know of him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, new coordinates. Lay in a course for Lya Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? Iam betrayed by desires. I want to feel. I want to feel everything. ButI am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I lost a bet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long to the Phelan system, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, call medics. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you making any progress toward solvingour problems? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I understand your frustration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought twice was pushing it a little. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve yourconscience by offering goods in exchange for our children. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I madeyou come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointedout, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp ofstarship operations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When Gowron begins his attack, then we willmake our move. Excalibur will fall back with engine problems. You willtake the Akagi and the Hornet to this position, which will open a smallgap in our detection net. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can we be prepared for that which we do not know? But I doknow that we are ready to encounter it. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is the Admiral, Karnas. Before he left on this mission, headministered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. Hewanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what thedrug has done to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to try to communicate with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You cannot win. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yamato, this is the Enterprise. Yamato, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise is scheduled to leave the Tyran system tomorrow. If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a very good reason. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's not rush it, shall we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, disengage the power transfer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, I want to reiterate, if you have any doubtswhatsoever about this procedure, you don't have to go through with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court'scontention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Testwhether this is presently true of humans. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon. Doctor Timicin, allow me to present LwaxanaTroi of Betazed. She's also a guest on board, and <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sit down, Counsellor. I want to talk to youabout a matter of protocol. I know there are no Starfleet regulationsabout a Captain becoming involved with a fellow officer, but <eos> <bos> PICARD: Plot a course. Take us out of orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingonsurvivors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still on Mintaka Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sounds perfect. Mister La Forge, how long before the baryonsweep begins on the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. That puts me in a difficult position. I promised toescort these people to their camps. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm curious about how this rare form of communication cameabout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The woman, Anya, is not what she appears tobe. She is an allasomorph. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot find any evidence of a Will Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you saying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Lock onto their coordinates. Beam them up directly toSickbay. Doctor Crusher, prepare for a Medical Emergency. Two to beamdirectly up to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ben Maxwell? But he's one of Starfleet's finest captains. Hemust have had provocation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Most likely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, this is fascinating. Don't you agree, Mrs. Troi? Commander, if your duties permit, why don't you join us for dessert? I'm sure that Mrs. Troi would much appreciate the pleasure of yourcompany. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Soon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vividly. But if I have forgotten my closest friends andcomrades, as you say, I deserved every word. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Before we begin, we want to see thechildren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You want to fight with me? Is that it? A challenge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I admit I must have mistaken their subspaceantenna for a weapons cluster. Unfortunately, I fired our main phasersand our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many more accidents? You must leave this body. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, any speculation on what we might find down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it should be a very enjoyable visit, then. She'll betransporting on board as soon as we reach the Starbase. Would you liketo greet her on our behalf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The transfer went well? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find you unavailable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How far inside Cardassian space is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prevent it from sending or receivingtransmissions of any kind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon will you be ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, we will get out of here. It's not going to be easy, butwe need to work together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. But we've been on the outer rim for a while. We haven't hadmuch contact with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Put us into a close orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Revive him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Cancel Red alert, Lieutenant. Commander, we shallreturn your officer and escort your ship to the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Because I want to know exactly what you did. I want toknow how closely you are in communication with the alien, and whatyou've learned about it, and I want to know now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I have enough time to back to the ship and get my saddle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full impulse. Rotate heading in five degree increments. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's their condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood andon you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if youagree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available toensure that it is conducted impartially. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately,I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain WesleyCrusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it God? Now, it's very important you answersomething. How do you recognise what it is? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How did this happen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: She gave me no choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, enough of this. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Viewer on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need your help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it gently. But do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do not provoke her <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think that's a little harsh. I think that's the truth. But that's a truth we have obscuredbehind a comfortable, easy euphemism. Property. But that's not theissue at all, is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, will you note in our report that if the governmentof Angosia survives the night, we will offer them Federation assistancein their efforts to reprogram their veterans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maman? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No I decided to walk. I met Marie and Rene. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leave Starfleet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could be certain that we'd tried everything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site onLandris Two. Could you put it through to my Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why are you safe?. Why is this house a sanctuary? Does it haveto do with you? With your refusal to fight? Tell me this. If Rishonwere in danger, would you kill to save her life? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's no logic in this at all. Whether they succeed or not,the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My medical team suggests there may be alternative treatment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Doctor <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Romulan vessel. We are en route to your position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates andWill's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statisticsand glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I wasabout to put it aside and look at another file and then somethingcaught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will wasFirst Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam downduring a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a generalcourt martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knewthat I had found my Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full sensors aft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'll just say congratulations for now, Deanna. You'llexcuse me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased to report that Ensign Crusher's Starfleet examresults permit him to continue his studies on board the Enterprise. Furthermore, any rumours of my brush with death are greatlyexaggerated. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're forcing a difficult decision on me,Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume this is not a time to confront him about what happenedto his ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Be careful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report to Mister Data. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm getting there. I'm going to have Engineering run a fullphysical on you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. From this time forward,you will service us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's better. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. In the past decade, Manheim has turned some vaguetheories into a practical application. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there are customs and rituals of which I have no experienceat all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Lieutenant Worf, personal log, stardate 44996.1. Ihave located the Klingon ship on which my brother Kurn serves ascaptain, and have arranged to join him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. You are seeing this ship, all of us, from aunique perspective. From a child's point of view. It must seem terriblyunfair and restrictive to you. As adults, we don't always stop toconsider how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of youngpeople. But if you're judging us as a people by the way we treat ourchildren, and I think there can be better criterion, then you mustunderstand how deeply we care for them. When our children are young,they don't understand what might be dangerous. Our rules are to keepthem from harm, real or imagined, and that's part of the continuity ofour human species. When Clara grows up, she will make rules for herchildren to protect them, as we protect her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're certain this is Vulcan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign T'Su? T'SU <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take torestore the engines? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much protection will the shields provide if we attempt topenetrate the wave? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause todo so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Load torpedo bays. Arm phasers. lock coordinates on the sourceof the tractor beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you have survived all this time as? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you get a direct look at it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It happened again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There must be a way to avoid this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Temba? What does that mean? Fire? Does Temba mean fire? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter roomthree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report to transporter room six immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And there is a bill to be settled at Mrs. Carmichael's boardinghouse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then perhaps we'll meet again. But next time, it will be outhere, among the stars. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As payment in full for your debt to me, you will guarantee hersafety. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was our pleasure, Mirok. And I hope that this example ofcooperation between our two peoples will not be an isolated incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you. Please, help yourselves to something to eat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In ways that I cannot even begin to calculate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Dirgo, I would appreciate it if you didn't bury mebefore I'm gone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long ago? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready. Main phasers to ready. Go toRed Alert, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you'remistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocentbecause you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasantemotions. Well, this time you will be held accountable. I'm taking youback to the Enterprise to release Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But this is not the present I remember. You said nothing wouldchange. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A creature against whom we seem to have no defence. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister McDowell, alert the main shuttlebay to have allavailable ships and pilots standing by in case we need them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the rest of the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two's company. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Hold position. Let's see what it does. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you object to your Captain ordering aclearly illegal kidnapping? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the conn, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Chief Engineer. I think I understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Part of you must have blamed me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A respiratory aliment? Is it contained? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I regret that I gave it up. It used to please my mother. But I didn't like performing in front of an audience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Lay in a course for the Devolin system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, there's nothing unusual about that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if what you're saying is true, then Rocha attackedLieutenant Uhnari to find a new body. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're goingto return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase two one one. ThePhoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together. Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit youthe dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The onlyalternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back tostarbase in disgrace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador Tomalak. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, youknow as well as I do I would never have graduated if you <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge, abort immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why is he unconscious? What happened to him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sur le pont d'Avignon, on y danseJELLICO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Walker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: During the missing day? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, are you able to return to duty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perrin. Amanda. I wanted to give you so much more. I wanted toshow you such tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock, Amanda, didyou know? Perrin, can you know how much I love you? I do love you! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Close the channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know a way of acquiring some discreet transport. Mister Worf,set a course for Torman Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where did it come from? How many <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centreand transfer all available power to the shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it stable enough for an away team? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps in this case, rethinking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Mendrossen <eos> <bos> PICARD: On what authority? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Darmok. The ocean. Darmok on the ocean. Ametaphor? For being alone? Isolated? Darmok on the ocean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've noticed qualities in you that could be harnessed, moulded. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your advice and concern, but this is not the timefor rash actions. We are still investigating. There are three other stations in this sector we have to visit. Let'sproceed in a calm and orderly manner. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has the right to meet death awake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, do you remember when I firstcame on board the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interesting choices. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Allow me to introduce my staff. First Officer William Riker,Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, Chief of Security, Natasha Yar. Well, what can we do for you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me, Tallera, what are these artefacts we've beencollecting? I know that they are Vulcan in origin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's beginning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, warp two now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what was your impression of Graves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Describe it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ultimate boundary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would appreciate it if we could discuss it now. You see, Ifeel that I would like to move beyond astrophysics to Engineering orSecurity, something that might even lead to Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why do doctors always say the obvious as though it's arevelation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need your help. I must find Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Number One. Or should I say, John Little. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Surrounding the structure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems Commander Data has it them as well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not as simple as that. He is surrounded by Mintakans. Ifhe dematerialises before their eyes, the impact <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's really quite intriguing. The whole thing is made possibleby a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion. But that's only the foundation. The modeling itself is done bygravimetric wave input. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we have clearance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll try, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you suggest? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you still unable to recall anything about your past? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you think, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're right. We can't react to every random thought thatcrosses the other person's mind. Isn't astonishing, though, how muchclutter there is in a consciousness. Odd memories coming to thesurface. Bitsof half-remembered songs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher, Mister La Forge, we aregoing to recreate the research station here on the holodeck. I want youto work with Commander Data on the preparations. In addition, CommanderLa Forge and Commander Riker, I want you to give the computer detaileddepositions of everything you saw, everything you heard while you wereon board. Counsellor, I want you to assist me during this inquiry. Mydecision about the extradition will be based upon the evidencepresented during these recreations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you heard of a woman named Kahlest? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Commander Data in particular? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, out of orbit. Warp five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Problem, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way? Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in amoment. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nuria, don't be afraid. No one is going to harm you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right, what's the next step? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cargo? Are those people crazy? What could possibly be soimportant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We learn as much as possible about a planet before we makefirst contact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Disengage the cloaking device, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what is feeding the damn thing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened to us in that missing day? Surely there must besome clues. Each of us should try and think what we were doing justbefore we blacked out. Reenact it if you have to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did I find her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Captain's log, perhaps? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I won't leave you. Please, let go of me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Mandl, an attack on one of my crew gives me the right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: AlkarALKAR <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our communications have been blocked by the nebula, Reittan. Isthere a problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we get through it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know how to communicate this, or even if it ispossible, but the question of justice has concerned me greatly oflately. And I say to any creature who may be listening, there can be nojustice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercisein exceptions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek is dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At all costs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you may have him confined. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. That must be Captain Telaka on the left. Let's look athim. Closer. My God. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. I believe we have time to take a closer look, NumberOne. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You say that as if you think that's what we all see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Madeline. Good to see you again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What would it be like, Counsellor? No ship, nobulky spacesuit. Just to live between the stars, have the entire galaxyas a home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything you'd like to say before we begin, NumberOne? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible to re-adjust the targeting sequence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It has been brought to my attention that you have been told toremain in here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're using a Code Forty Seven. I have to know what this isall about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're preparing to take the Brittain in tow. We'll be on ourway within the hour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you discussed this with your mother? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Alone, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remarkable. And so these <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, not exactly <eos> <bos> PICARD: To die on a transporter. Hardly a fitting end for one of theFederation's most honoured diplomats. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Ready? Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. If anyone needs me, I'll be in my Ready Room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then find others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite certain, Data. By all means, demonstrate your gifts ofaffection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised of your progress. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Prime Minister? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There should be room for both in this life. And what about you,you old rascal. You've taken quite a shift into the future yourself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Conn, where are you headed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I weren't travelling through time I would never haverealized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in thepast as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, myability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what'sgoing on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That human-shaped robots need not be clumsy or limited. Youcertainly operate as well as we do, Data <eos> <bos> PICARD: My own counterpart. The captain's final message, praising hiscrew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good? Data, isn't good and bad, right and wrong, a function ofyour ethicalprogramme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'm fine, Doctor. Lieutenant Yar, run a structural analysison the Stargazer for an impulse tow. Data, download all computers tothe Enterprise and file. I'm going to look at my old cabin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We didn't hear you. We come in peace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we must agree to an arbiter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, couldthat be the Hood returning here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I'm really sorry. I don't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to findsome way to help him to make a positive contribution. Get to know theman better. Make him your best friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the two of you are very well acquainted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How's your patient? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. I wish I could excuse myself as well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, Geordi, Deanna. I don't think you've met our host. Thisis Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Counsellor Deanna Troi. Thisis Commander Hutchinson. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worfthat I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyaltythan rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you'renot the Worf once I knew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Ensign, bring us about. Take us out of the nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me where you've hidden the Tox Uthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently, the Yridians knew more about the Professor's workthan we do. They may have known what these numbers mean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed, DaiMon Tarr. You should be able to view us now. Are weon your screen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll do my best to arrange that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. Andhe had his own children but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so Iwas like the son who understood him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He'd probably send us both to bed without our supper. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We were saddened by those events but they occurred within thedesignated borders of the Cardassian Empire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, proceed with Timothy as the Counsellor suggests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel red alert. Mister Worf, will you extend the appreciationof the Federation and my personal gratitude to the Klingons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Garrett, damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your son? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That word demand has a tone of finality. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, please receive our guest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shields up. Stand by phasers. Damage report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, lock onto the neutrino beam and stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but I don't want to leave any avenue unexplored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Look, this is not an order, it's a request and it's onewhich you must feel perfectly free to decline. You see, one of the mostimportant things in a person's life is to feel useful. Now, MisterScott is a Starfleet officer and I would like him to feel useful again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare for emergency transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I said you're not doing this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was it that didn't you mean to do, Timothy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: At your earliest convenience, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the situation, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying you want to back out of this mission? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: It certainly is the last place one would expect Romulanencroachment. On the other hand, Galorndon Corewould provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we suffered the same fate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, what have you been doing for the past decade? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, take your station and keep her with you. This doesconcern her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible he could have been abducted? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your friends. There was someone called Tom Norris? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in the lab. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Consider the first time a run-through, a rehearsal toshake out the flaws. The second time will succeed if we leave no clues. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe my associate, Mister La Forge, may be bringing theanswer to that question. I request a recess. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, what sort of jaded game ishe up to this time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you doing in such a filthy uniform? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impulse engines. Ahead, minimum power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't see that you have to lose anything just by adding aconvenience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said you had responsibilities. Whatexactly did you mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It means to spy, to sneak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kamala, have I not done everything possible to discourage this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side,Commander. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Human. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, the shrieking noise you made. It causes them pain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If this is the Borg, it would indicate they have a source ofpower far superior to our own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did the shuttle's flight logs show where Galen had been beforecoming to the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Please. And feel free to examine the work of the otherstudents too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've heard more than enough. You're you again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Arkaria base. Deactivate the baryon sweep. ArkariaBase, this is Captain Picard on board the Enterprise. Deactivate thebaryon sweep! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi and I are having a very interesting discussion aboutvarious societies' ways of giving thanks. The Betazoid use of thechime, for instance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, what have you done? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history ofinsubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during theCardassian incident at Minos Korva. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartographyisn't everybody's cup of tea. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it working? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I want you and Mister Worf to run high resolutionscans of this star system. Look for a ship, a base of operations,anything large enough to generate that power. Mister La Forge,accompany Doctor Clark back to the science station. See if you cantrace the origin of these tremors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Mendak, I will take whatever action is necessary toobtain the return of the Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary. I think that synthehol heightens one'sappreciation for the genuine article. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, it can be, but I have never subscribed to the theory thatpolitical power flows from the barrel of a gun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton fielddisturbance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Into living plants? How is that possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we had clear evidence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then this moon is a penal colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the relays? Are you absolutely certain you don'tneed a new phase invertor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does that mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were inyour position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. Butyou're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. Iknow it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take theship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warpshell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may notsurvive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greaterpurpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you canpossibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about eachother, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only beentogether for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in thefleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking youfor a leap of faith, and to trust me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what do you think? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And you, sir? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, escort Ishara to the transporter room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Absolutely out of the question. The Prime Directive <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. You are not the first officer on this ship to havea new family member. Take care of your son. The security matters canwait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs Ten Forward. How is Lal doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, we are prepared to defend the life of the alien. Screen off. Shields up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or he may have nothing to do with it at all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're doing all you can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much time do we have, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's start withthem, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Step on it. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

That is why we must to stop this now, beforeit's too late. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you like to talk about it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to go down to the cemetery. See if you canpinpoint the source. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a month, the metagenic agent itself breaks down anddissipates completely, leaving every city, every road, every piece ofequipment perfectly intact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were infected. They used the felicium to cure themselves,but somehow their ancestors realised that it was a narcotic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let us do no such damned thing! What is this need of yours forcostumes, Q? Have you no identity of your own? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can't kill all of us. You need us to run the ship more thanwe need you to command it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do we stop it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have already reported our position and the nature of thisviolation to Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At Tanagra. I remember the words but I don't understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to go over to her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run itscourse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. In a moment. You were about to say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we'll both beam in simultaneously in two different areas ofthe Bridge. With luck one of us will be a distraction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why was he assigned to the Lunar Five facility? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And his father? <eos> <bos> PICARD: End this, and I will give you whatever help you need. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think so, really? I wonder which of them was made first? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's Ressikan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You missed Gul Evek by a matter of hours. I asked him to stay. I thought that an Admiral's assurances might convince him that we aretrying to deal with this Maquis situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. They've picked a fine officer for the taskforce, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beamdown. Karnas, I asked Doctor Crusher to bring with her the visualrecords we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look atthem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I do, Data. And I believe it is our job to out-con the conartist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your personal affairs are strictly your ownconcern until they interfere with the operation of this ship. You havenow crossed that line. As your Captain, I want to know exactly what isgoing on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. You can't go through with the ceremony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Negative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if they have abused the boy, why would he so devoutly wishto return to them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're becoming quite annoying, Sovak. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gul Macet, will you join me on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The inertial dampers shouldn't fail without kicking in theautomatic bypass. I want to know what went wrong. Analysis in thirtyminutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Just not very good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take care, Uncle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, Mister Data, I'm going to ask you again, and I order youto directly answer me. What really happened to us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I might ask you the same question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll notify Starbase of your acceptance They'll contact theKlingon vessel, make the arrangements. Captain's log, stardate 42506.5. We have departedfrom Starbase one seven nine and are headed for a rendezvous with theKlingon vessel, Pagh. I have informed the staff of Commander Riker'stemporary assignment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, how long will this behaviour last? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My crew and I need a bit more informationbefore we make our recommendations to Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cup? Glass? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am much relieved, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, indeed. It's good to see you again, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you tried reconfiguring the plasmaconduits? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, Mister Crusher, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

It must be herdecision. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't there something else you have to do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll wait here for months if necessary. We're just considering options. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not quite what I meant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Fajo, I realise we have acquired your complete supply ofhytritium. Do you know where we could obtain some more? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I didn't know. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel, we are awaiting your response. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. Captain's log, stardate 41464.8. I have declared anindefinite quarantine for Velara Three, and we are now returning toStarbase with the three surviving terraformers. Perhaps the lesson wehave learned from this near tragedy will prevent it from happeningelsewhere. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

It turns out thatthey had dismantled their ship and hidden it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not pretend to fully understand thenuances of your world's law or culture, Lieutenant, but I do understandwhen somebody is trying to hide something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr will be preparing me for my role in therite of succession. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in theNeutral Zone, in the Devron System. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their pastassociates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Battle of Maxia. I've never heard it referred to sodramatically before. My sincere regrets, Bok, but that vessel refusedto identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And all available personnel, including you and me, will beginto put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew onboard the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you made this offer to Orta? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a good chance that our competition may be here beforeus. Battle stations, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'd better take a look at it, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. More fundamental doubts. Whether or not it can bejustified. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. Mysense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would bebest if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. I'm serving ashost for these proceedings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you localise the source of the gravitational field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now you have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are her requests unusual? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aye aye, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no. I want to go over this again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Or against you personally? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Your daughter has explained your telepathic ability. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, Robert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've both seen the message about the plague? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is at the heart of our nature to feel pain and joy. It is anessential part of what makes us what we are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to see my people in the shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you write it out? I am so sorry that your friends werekilled. I'm sorry, I don't know what you are trying to tell me. We haveto find some way to communicate with him. Data, he knows some kind ofgestural language. Find our which one and learn it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we will have to find someone too whom she will listen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will assume that we'll be searching for them. He'll find some way to send us a message. Mister Worf, I want continualmonitoring of Ferengi subspacefrequencies. Mister La Forge, can you extend our sensor range? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, we have a few things to discuss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley! Wesley! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't make that assumption. The effect on the Yamato wasdevastating, but what if it was by accident, not by design. What I'mgoing to say may sound unscientific, but standing on this soil,breathing in this air, my instincts tell me that we may have got themwrong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A great poet once said, 'all spirits are enslaved that servethings evil'. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think we have a choice. We must destroy that archive. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not from Nottingham. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have ten. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leave the trilithium here and take me with you. You can use meas a hostage instead of threatening <eos> <bos> PICARD: It must have been. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let's hope that you're mistaken, Ensign. But can youpoint us at the right individual, as Mister Data suggested? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I just couldn't make him understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could there have had some sort of malfunction? A reactor corebreach? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I want a tactical projection of possible future Romulandeployments along the Neutral Zone. Access all Federation records onthe subject and report to my Ready Room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get that seal back up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Initiate emergency bulkheads in turboshaft four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck to both of you. Bractor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, Number One, you missed something not playing withmodel ships. They were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding atreasure of adventures. Manning the earliest space craft, flying aaeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Can youimagine that? Now the machines are flying us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, gentlemen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, perhaps it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you, we will do everything possible to make youcomfortable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi had the good sense to ask for shore leave. Ican see I'm going to have to suggest it to you. Have a good time,Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. Ifwe're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But why would a generator be affecting the Enterprise this way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any indications of life, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can I get you some coffee? Tea? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, any heading, warp six. Now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: The challenge, Mister Offenhouse, is to improve yourself. Toenrich yourself. Enjoy it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The minute they believe that we won't accept their compensationfor the children, they'll break off the discussion, they'll disappearbehind their shield, locking us out and the children in forever. That'swhy I've got to keep them talking. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arabian. The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south windand made the horse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I think he can help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Corey, that won't solve anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And prosper. Captain's log, stardate 45240.1. To cross theNeutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set acourse for the Klingon home world. After all we did for Gowron duringthe recent war, I am certain he will be happy to return a favour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, I'd like you tomonitor our velocity closely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Overtake, warp eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Greetings from the United Federation of Planets. I am CaptainJean Luc Picard, of the Enterprise. This is Counsellor Troi. Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have a moon inexplicably falling out of orbit, and just nowthis ship was probed with Berthold radiation. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now stop! I will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroythis meeting. Now please, sit down. Now, Commander Riker has asked thatyourlaboratories be inspected for stolen tissue samples, and I understandhis concern. We may have to transport all your equipment here, to theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's not open for business yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro was invaluable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Woven art? Recovered intact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, when sensors indicate she's alone, beam her directly totransporter room one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worthy of Holmes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And, Mister La Forge <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, yes, speaking as a mother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. While he's doing that, Number One, I want you andLa Forge to try and find some way of getting through one of thoseholes, because one way or the other we have got to get an away team onthe planet, locate the power source for the shield and neutralise it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf <eos> <bos> PICARD: That grid, their wounds. Only the Q can do that. Captain's log, stardate 41591.4. Twelve minutes outfrom Quadra Sigma Three where the survivors of an underground disasterdesperately need our help. Aboard the Enterprise, First Officer WilliamT. Riker needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject far out ofmy experience. Out of any human's experience. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I don't think that's possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a joke, Corey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, I want you to stop this experiment for now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Redblock? I'll keep it in mind. Thank you for helping me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will be the day. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He can take all the credit he wants, I don't caret. But I doneed a ship. Well if Gowron won't talk to me, get someone who will. Somebody on theHigh Council. K'Tal, perhaps. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you trying to tell me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Comments. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then set course for Sarona Eight. As I remember we were on ourway for some much needed shore leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For what? What have you brought us here for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, Mister Data. I believe that if we find thesource of those tetryon emissions, we'll find the missing crewmembers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the origin of this debris field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the wish to stay alive. Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we heard that, Number One. We'll try and track it downfrom here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your published writings have been sporadic for the last decade. Your appearance at symposia has been rare, or scheduled and thencancelled at the last moment. The finest archaeologist of the centuryis now shrouded with a cloak of mystery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker, put us nose to nose with the Sheliak ship. Anymove she makes, match it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, I don't have to remind you of the psychological impactof being a hostage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, take the Enterprise and investigate theproblem. Ensign Crusher and I will proceed to Pentarus Five. The miners have sent a shuttle. We shall leave in ten minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The eruptions have stopped. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Bring him on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, no! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, I may not make it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn you!  PICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said there were only two of you left. What happened to the rest of the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set auto-destruct sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where are we going? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course you do. You have an excellent record. However,here on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You will reportyour observations to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been saving this for a special occasion. My brother onEarth produces fruit known as grapes, which he turns into wine. He'sreally quite good at it. Chancellor, we have a tradition called atoast. It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune, and Iwould like to propose a toast to a new friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a coastal city that has been neutral throughout theconflict. Both Seronians and Rekag loyalists live there. It might beacceptable as a compromise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have injuries? Can we assist you in any way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Why not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. What do you intend to tell them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a worthy Federation competitors in the bidding, Leyorof the Caldonians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, is there any point to all this? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, there's nothing about you I find tantalising. On thecontrary, I find you obvious and vulgar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Is someone ill? Or would you rather tell her about this,Wes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Premier. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold on! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can you determine for certain thatthe energy source from the planet is powering this creation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontationwith Commander Riker. Computer, play Riker programme four, time indextwenty four one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what we'redealing with on Turkana Four. The last information describes a colonyin almost complete disarray. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I think this charade has gone far enough. Don'tyou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's been an accident. Ambassador T'Pel has been killed in atransporter malfunction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Have you been ableto determine the cause of our transformation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Delightful. Tell me, why is the corridor so quiet? The lasttime I was here, it was bustling with activity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you done to her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're out of options. Do it! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leave me alone, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Firing impulse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in theface. Ready, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there is any way of finding out whatever is out there, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting that we're in some kind of laboratory? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, those feelings came from his heart, Spock. He shared themwith me. I know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. A few more daysof relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can seewhatever is outside this vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, usually you have to remind me, then badger me, andfinally order me to report. For once I thought I'd save you thetrouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns. Can youisolate one of them and magnify? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the world of fact, probably not. However, in literature,criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise. The immortal SherlockHolmes would have an interesting view of our mystery, I believe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Starship Essex vanished over two hundred years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the evacuation, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fully enlarge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, what is it you say? Take a deep breath. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Frankly, it's difficult for me, for many of us, to easilyaccept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone elsewants them to be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I commend your performance, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't believe that my career in Starfleet has been amistake. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come in, Number One. Commander Shelby was just telling me ofyour concerns about her plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For youto work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of aterrible personal tragedy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Audio on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And our response? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Letshear the analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, let's move on to another survey region. Have stellarcartography begin a <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Qapla' <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Number One. Come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I'm Captain Picard. This is Commander William Riker. He will be yielding the firstofficer's position to you during your tour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But do you understand the basis of all this nonsense betweenthem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the nexttransition proceeding. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft ofpassion and imagination. That is not who I am. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, take the conn position. Engineering, this is theBridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you mind thinking of something else. You're making mehungry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You think you're going to be killed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Before we leave, I ask you one more time to come to the ship. For your own safety. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why don't you just take your ships across? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long can we expect it to last? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the total? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it's just a jumble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, you have crossed the Neutral Zone. This isFederation territory. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filledwith you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut off the power to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half of theirplanet to the Federation while leaving the other half out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He had a kind face. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. Who is this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's correct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have assaulted a Federation starship, killed and woundedseveral members of her crew, kidnapped two of her officers, and youdon't expect a response? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, I'll need your help to monitor the sensor readingsduring this investigation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of traders? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a fast decision, which we must takeas positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly. to let you mediate the dispute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put a repeating message on all subspace channels. Order theLieutenant to come about and stand to. Make it a priority onecommuniqué. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you launch a full-scale attack now, then the Duras fleetwill call for supplies. Lursa and B'Etor will call for help. TheRomulans will try to run the blockade, and we'll be ready for them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll be at the rendezvous on schedule, don't worry. Excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Number One, have you been monitoring communications? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data and the alien are on their way down. What would beinvolved in removing all memory of her communication with DataPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: I find that hard to believe. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done, Mister Data. Though I don't think you got CommanderRiker's hair quite right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How's it going? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Shumar. We'll be approaching the southern polar regionthat you requested in a few minutes. I need to give additionalinstructions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's being held safely until sundown. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I thought that the weather controlmalfunction was not severe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On top of everything, there's been a change. We've been givenonly two weeks to complete the exploration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you bring her out of it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A distress call from a ship called the Kallisko. It's beingpursued by an unknown object. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, do you have lock on the away team? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You get used to it. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection. There is no conclusive evidence that this woman evervisited the planet a thousand years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. I know Hamlet. And what he might said with irony, I saywith conviction. What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason. Howinfinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. Inaction, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: To all Maquis ships. Call off your attack or we will be forcedto engage you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The southern pole? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives. It depletedyour food supplies, left your population weakened and miserable and yetyou risk another war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose I could find a few hours to spend on the holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is that? One of your allies? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, let's take a closer look. Perhaps we can findsomething that will give us a more positive identification. Helm, takeus through the debris field, ahead slow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lifesigns? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He was alone down there for a long time. I'm hesitant to lethim go back until he's been evaluated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I relieve you, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in thegalaxy. If I save this boy, I break that law. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, how is Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't! <eos> <bos> PICARD: It isn't specific. It simply refers toforeign investors. Sale price, twelve point five million United States <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, if at all possible, we will continue this mission asplanned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That it did, Number One. Rest assured. <eos> <bos> PICARD: File Dixon Hill, private detective. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Additional information. The number ofcolonists at the site is five hundred and four. Are you prepared forthat many, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And no apparent explanation for the energy loss? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't see that we have any choice. Mister Worf, will you hailthe Bre'el Four science station, <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend, Ronin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could they be naturally occurring? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did she personally form the government that so peacefully ruledthis planet for a millennium? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know of nothing out here that could possibly justify what youhave done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lay in an intercept course, full impulse. Lock phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My apologies if I interrupted a waltz. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only a few more metres. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite acard player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long timeago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We're the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you're aware that we have no hostile interaction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way, Number One. Data, the moment you decided to stopimitating other actors and create your own interpretation, you werealready one step closer to understanding humanity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. I hope so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign. Well done. Initiate that procedure . Lieutenant, add that information to hailing messages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full about, one quarter impulse. Take us out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long have you been here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? You're not attending the dinner with the rest of usthis evening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Galen to Bridge. Alter course for Vulcan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Steady. Analysis of the nebula cloud, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The imaging logs? Are you suggesting that you have evidence theCardassians have tampered with the Array? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't afford to stay here any longer. We'll leave a classfour probe behind to study the energyfield but the distress signal from Ligos Seven has top priority. Let meknow as soon as you have any further information, Doctor. Number One,you're with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it would be only fair. But let's allow her the moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can you locate the signal? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well then, let's move on to the environmental gains on VentaxTwo. How were those accomplished <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Look, if we try to deceive one other, then we shall getnowhere. I think we all know about Professor Galen's research, andabout the computer programme composed of fragments. I'll take yoursilence as confirmation. Now, it stands to reason that none of us hasthe DNA fragments necessary to complete the programme. You were thefirst to arrive in this system. Do you have an organic sample from theplanet below? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't care what you believe! <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. Second incommand, Data. Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Someone invented a hut. Someone invented a bow, who taughtothers, who taught their children, who built a stronger hut, built abetter bow, who taught their children. Now, Nuria, suppose one of yourcave dwelling ancestors could see you as you are today. What would shethink? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll be on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. If you have a case to make againstTarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here andnow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I don't understand why you are unwilling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has it been adrift for all those years, or has it has travelledthrough time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are four lights. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's another piece to of puzzle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. It's just that you look very familiar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A nursery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, I strongly suspect it's some explaining you have to do now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Might there be some side effect of Cairn telepathy of whichwe're unaware? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, your status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Attention all decks. This is to inform you that with yoursupport the Traveller has returned us to our galaxy. However, he hasnow left us. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. Have the boy sentto the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm glad to hear it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps because he's hoping to expose members of your movement. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need to see my father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry to disappoint you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Data? What do you think? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ridiculous. Did you do your best? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It might be viewed as an act of aggression. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are trifling with the primal instincts of our species. Imust warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for theirchildren. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Three. I want you tohear what she and Brull have to say. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There have been three major engagements inthe last two weeks, all of them won by ships loyal to the Duras family. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was his father a traitor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take him to Sickbay. Let me know the instant he's awake. Anything new on that that thing out there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you will escort Q toEngineering. You will assist Mister La Forge. Mister Worf, hail theBre'el Four science station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister La Forge, but you've done your job. Now Imust do mine. I relieve you, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can give you books that will help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes! Inside here! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare for emergency transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lower shields. Surrender, as ordered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do we know about that pulsar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was that it? Is that the other choice? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than aweek ago, I would say that your efforts are meeting with limitedsuccess. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin long-range scanningof all sectors within threelight years of Braslota. Howis your crew shaping up? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officersare deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry. Further investigation is recommended. Will, there was no furtherinvestigation. This report was classified and then it was quietlyburied. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Follow them in, Mister Crusher. Red Alert. Mister Worf, armphoton torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, keep an eye on the Cardassian border. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, Captain Louvois has issued a ruling. You are the propertyof Starfleet Command. You can not resign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's all of them except for the two on the Bridge. Waithere until I return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you think this Ronin could be exerting some sort ofinfluence over her? That it's because of him that she's staying? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which had a terrestrial launch date ofJuly 23rd, 2037. It was the third manned attempt to travel beyond theconfines of the Earth's solar system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You sure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It usually refers to the memories. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a life, Data. It can't be activated and deactivatedsimply. This is a most stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea whatwill happen when Starfleet learns about this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, sometimes the moral obligations of command are lessthan clear. I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs ofthe individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible. God knows, I don't always succeed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're saying that when our time intersects with the time heleft, in that instant he will function normally and, and there will betwo of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Ensign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, to me it's just an undefined form,standing in a visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneousinformation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of theRenaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himselfin a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him hereabout to perform one final creative act before giving up his artforever. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Crosis? How did you get that name? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, kindly take charge of ourguests until we have time to decide what we're going to do with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My feelings toward Vash are irrelevant. I would attempt to saveany innocent life, as you well know. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please transmit coordinates for immediate transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How soon can your ship be ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small andinsignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps, but if this is an accurate representation, it couldexplain what happened in that system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are outrageous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Allright, let's focus their attention. Mister Worf, fire phasers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is hardly a scientific observation, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put that down, please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Steady as she goes <eos> <bos> PICARD: Resign? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm told that your father is also dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome to the Bridge, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's going to take a little time to explain, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 46945.3. We successfullyevacuated the crew of the Romulan ship, and we're on course to theNeutral Zone to bring them home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number of casualties? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sorry, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, Wesley. Come on the Bridge. Move! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, it's my fault that you're here. I shouldn't have askedyou. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use somesleep. Captain's log, supplemental. Starfleet Commandreports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone, and there is nosign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only memberof the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low levelreconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've seen your mission briefing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. What I do know is, things will be different. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well it looks like we're going to be on Caldos for a few daysmore. This will be a good opportunity to get your grandmother's affairsin order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, scan for defences. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, whom did you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Options, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is the information being sent now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must have some idea how things havechanged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do they mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I improvised. With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill, Iordered a sensor bearing, and when it went into the return arc <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, now, this is rather unusual for you to be curious aboutan away mission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sovereign Marouk, welcome to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Karnas, this is Admiral Mark Jameson. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he's an android. Is that possible! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: The trouble is, he could be right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do we know each other? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would have definite advantages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, earlier, I was reading this book, and I had thedistinct feeling I'd read certain paragraphs before. But I assumed I'dread the book years ago and I'd forgotten. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status reports? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, stay with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not yet. But you will. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Each community would be responsible for its own. Condenserscould make the difference between watering our crops or watching themdie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do not attack again! We are on a peacefulmission. Give your identity. You force us to defend ourselves. Phasersfull up. Arm torpedoes. Why aren't the shields at full power? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe you're in my chair. Captain's log, stardate <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, let's raise our voice a little. Fire phasers. Justa warning shot. Mister Data, invite them to stand to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The hostages have been freed by Karnas,unharmed, and the body of Admiral Mark Jameson has been buried onMordan, at the request of his widow and by the permission of Karnas. The quest for youth, Number One. So futile. Age and wisdom have theirgraces too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm, set course for the Topin system. Mister Data, will yousignal the science ship that we're on our way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are thepeople of Minos? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The flute? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, I understand that your homeworld hassome of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Isthere any place in particular that you would recommend I visit whileI'm there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will rendezvous with the warship Q'Maire at oh seven fortyhours. We will transfer the Talarians to Captain Endar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he cando it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's the good news, what's the bad news? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, explain control malfunction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Keep me informed. Picard out. I'll be in my quarters. It will be a dress uniform dinner, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, you've heard? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, I've been fortunate to have access to your Betazoidabilities. Most starship captains have to be content with a humancounsellor. Empathic awareness is not a requirement of your position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, they will be detained by the Vulcan authorities for themoment. But they're also facing charges from the Klingons, theCardassians, the Ferengi, and at least seven other worlds. Idon't think we'll be hearing from them for a while. Number One, willyou set course for Starbase two twenty seven. I'll join you on theBridge shortly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The environmental settings in these quarters have been altered. Data, over here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is someone there? Who's there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is Odan? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge will be entirely at your disposal,Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's see what happens when it hits the shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Too close, Number One. Brinksmanship is a dangerous game. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

How do we stop it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I think there are some things of which you should bemade aware. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At last. How can we help? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They sound hungry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, I deeply regret that we have notbeen able to reach an agreement. But, and I must be blunt, I cannottake no for an answer. This planet will be handed over to theCardassian government in accordance with the terms of the borderagreement. I am very sorry, but you will have to leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frightenother predators and to mark territory, and to commence mating process. A mating process. Counsellor Troi was bitten by a Klingon but not in aplace that might be life-threatening. Nowhere near a major artery ororgan. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was neverintended to give her any kind of serious harm. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggest what the Romulans were doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready and willing. Able to serve. What would you do? Would youstart as an ordinary crewman? What task is too menial for an entity? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level,find some way to influence their behaviour? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, if you'll excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There was a teacher of mine at the Academy who had beenconfined to a wheelchair since birth. She was a woman <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seems I did make that bargain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hmm. You'd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy,awkward, but look at this. It's a model of simplicity. Elegant,functional. They built this craft for generations. And it worked. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Manoeuvring thrusters? <eos> <bos> PICARD: These mercenaries use weapons that can activate theirtransporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly, justby firing at them. That's what they did to me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Corey, there's got to be a better way to handle this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience amomentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I wantyou to take command immediately. Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have forty crewmembers on board the Hathaway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When did you last time you look in on the Antedean guests? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am aware of that. But each of us, including Doctor Palmertook an oath that we would uphold the Prime Directive, if necessary,with our lives. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as aStarfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps prevent one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you input that new code? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't accept that explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about Mister Data? There must be some connection betweenhis odd behaviour and these creatures. Is he infested as well? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He loves you very much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A lot of questions, Number One. Damn fewanswers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. So that's why you married me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll deal with the repercussions later. We must knowwhat you want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which you asked the computer to provide. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: They can insert them into the recall loop? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I have my orders. I'm sure you understand that. Now Doctor, this deflector wasn't set properly. It must be positionedso that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway, or it'suseless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I couldn't tell you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. Headmitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now itoccurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to savehumanity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, take a look at this. It appears that Mister Worfhad just beamed these three on board, and according to this, threeother Romulans had been beamed directly to Sickbay just secondsearlier. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't you see, Riker? He's nothing but a flim-flam man! He'sbeen that ever since we first met him at Farpoint. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Amanda? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even then there's no guarantee that we'll find a suitableplanet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which no doubt you sold for a very impressive profit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is it now, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lock phasers on target. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set course to intersect with the freighter. Warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, maybe now would be a good time to start. Follow me,gentlemen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can find a substitute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but it would've been a more fitting legacy if the messagehad not fallen on such deaf ears. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two Federation outposts in sector threezero have been destroyed. There's been no communication with Federationstarbases in sector three one since stardate 41903.2. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The last three nights I've, I've heard these voices. I'm on thebridge of my old ship. There's fire all around me. The klaxons, smoke. And then I give the order. And now the Stargazer is really here!. Andthat log. Am I going crazy? How do I know I was in my right mind atMaxia? How do I know I'm in my right mind now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, have you been able to assess Commander Riker's condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew that you werestill alive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will now return control of this vessel to the Bridge whereit belongs. At once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agreed. All right then. Mister Worf, initiate your searchpattern. Let's head in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to take that twentieth century historian. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transportersdo. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were not affected? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Today, perhaps. But if there are others with the courage ofAdmiral Jarok, we may hope to see a day of peace when we can take hisletter home. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

All I need now is a little time tomyself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. Initiate recovery procedures. Continue repairs. Plota course for the nearest starbase. Captain's log, supplemental. With the transporter repaired and my crewsafely back aboard, we have officially ended our first Starfleet battlesimulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold your positions. Take no action. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damage report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. Whatreport on the logs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then in that case <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's all right. They're called lynars, a kind of Celtrine bat. They're harmless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possiblyphoton torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us out of orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. How many are there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said that the message came directly from Ambassador Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as theunending horizon. A curve <eos> <bos> PICARD: Familiar, yes, but I can't represent your peoples' interests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beamhim aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What had to be done? For whom? Why does a man with a long andbrilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he hasbelieved in, even fought for, all his life? I believe it is because ofwhat they did to your wife and your children. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain. Senior officers will report to myReady room immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiterof Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here andinvestigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would like to offer a proposal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, go with him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I look forward to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just get on with it, Doctor. I've got work to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor, I wonder why you're in so much of a hurry. Is thiswoman involved with you in some illegal venture? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis. Well, perhaps we'vegot a tempest in a test tube, after all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You still have no theory as to what's causing it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What would you have me do, Data? How would you handle this ifour positions were reversed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not perfect in what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there is a psychology to these creatures, we must discoverit. If there is an explanation for their behaviour, we must know whatit is. Even in your current condition, you are the most qualifiedperson aboard this ship to assist. Data is in Observation attempting toformulate a strategy. I want you to join him. Deanna, we need you. Captain's log, supplemental. If our speed andcourse remain unchanged, in one hour the Enterprise will be torn apartby the gravitational forces of the cosmic string fragment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get a signalthrough this strong a magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If asearch party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for thosemountains. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise hasentered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the firstStarfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion withyour mother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. Well, what is it, Wesley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't have a brother. Two sisters, Anne and Melissa. Whatthe hell is this all about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Klingon cruiser, this is Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the mostprecious time. Now will never come again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are <eos> <bos> PICARD: You led us quite a chase, Mister Crusher. Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. Now, it mightnot have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jared, you've described quite thoroughlythe history of your people before and after Ardra's first visit. But Iam a little unclear about the change itself. Did Ardra simply snap herfingers and transform the planet into this paradise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cycle power through ventral relay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eline? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't recall saying I was embarrassed. If's just that Iprefer to be acquainted with the women that I kiss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us to visual range, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Karnas could have worked for peace during those years insteadof continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's only one planet in the Kurlan system capable ofsupporting life. Loren Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, four billion years ago someone scattered this geneticmaterial into the primordial soup of at least nineteen differentplanets across the galaxy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan. Certainlynot for Spock who is half-human. Years spent in conflict. And now thechance to resolve all of those differences is gone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need the transporters to function despite the hyperonicradiation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you don't follow orders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything from Gowron? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In time, Mister Data. When we're better prepared. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, this is a relief. I thought that perhaps Q had found <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Riker, we can carry out your repairs immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Moriarty, this vessel's computer has a vast memory capacity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We understand what you are saying. We will leave you. We willsend you home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Think, Tallera. Two thousand years ago your people were beingconsumed by war. But when peace came to Vulcan, the resonator becameuseless. That's why it was dismantled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates. This is Nails, from Chicago. And this is <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you're looking at me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of thosewho attacked this world. The victors invariably write the history totheir own advantage. There is an unfortunate tendency in many culturesto fear what they do not understand. It's possible that their enemies,confronted with this technology, were driven to attack the Iconians outof fear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As if it's something Q is doing to trickus? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not today. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. However, there are circumstances of which you may beunaware. The survivor has suffered a memory loss. He's thereforeill-equipped to defend himself against your accusations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Director Mandl, we've heard of your remarkableachievements in terraforming. My crew would very much appreciatelooking around. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know, Mister Data. Can we establish communication? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smoothrelations between peoples. Not to act as a strait <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were they pressured to return? Were they threatened with anypunishment if they didn't? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, are there other people on this planet? How long have youbeen here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the weather modificationnet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would be very happy to explain that to you, but for now Imust ask you and your men to leave immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But Mister Data is a member of my crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What in heaven's name? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No harm done. It's going to take at least a couple of hours tocharge this cell. Then as soon as it's done, we should get it over tothe shuttle immediately. This cell casing is already beginning to breakdown. Anna, we are going to get out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar using them in combat withLutan's wife. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to intercept the Romulan vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you have taken on quite a responsibility, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Position report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was wondering if you had any feelings about the OfficerExchange Programme initiated by Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps someone to answer your questions, Number One. Openhailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, make certain that we're still picking up thegamma radiation pattern of the Entity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible they could have been feeding you disinformation? You said that you had been censured. Reassigned, four months ago. Theyknew of your dissatisfaction. Could all this have been to test yourloyalty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, under the circumstances, I think it would be prudent if Iwere to make myself less available for the duration of this journey. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then Riva the mediator <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, end Red alert. And try to access a Federation timebase beacon. Let's see if we can find out how long we've been in thiscausality loop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is a life form and it has intelligence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Captain Picard. I can not allow you toleave. Before we can go forward, the cycle must end. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very little. It was thought to be uninhabited until theseemissions were detected. Starfleet believes that the Cardassians mayhave a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet surface. Our orders are to penetrate this Celtris Three installation anddetermine if the Cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's headed for Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From the moment they agreed to give them the felicium, my handswere tied. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of theuniverse strikes me as being hollow, Q. I see no evidence that you areguided by a superior moral code, or any code whatsoever. You may benearly omnipotent, and I don't deny that your parlour tricks are veryimpressive, but morality? I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it, Q. Iwould put human morality against the Q's any day. And perhaps that'sthe reason that we fascinate you so. Because our puny behaviour showsyou a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence, a moralcentre. And if so, I can think of no crueller irony than that youshould destroy this young woman, whose only crime is that she's toohuman. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, there's nothing much to talk about. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, you have the advantage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Apparently the Tamarians arrived atEl-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They have been transmitting asubspace signal towards Federation space ever since. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Advise Starfleet of our status, Mister Data. When AdmiralKennelly calls, I'll speak to him in my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's Terran. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Three weeks. Starfleet is profuse in their apologies, but itwill still be three weeks until the arrival of a colony transport shipequipped with dedicated personnel shuttles. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. Picard to Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've seen enough. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't say that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even their deaths might have prevented this war. If theEnterprise-C returns to the battle and its mission is a success,history will be irrevocably changed. This time line will cease to existand a new future will have been created. I've considered thealternatives. I'll go with Guinan's recommendation. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just be gone. That'll do nicely. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not interfere with Homn's duties this time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: From what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pressman? Yes, of course. You were Will's first commandingofficer, on the Pegasus. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defence matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? The first on. Captain Debin. Captain, let me ask youagain. What are Okona's crimes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a longmission ahead of us. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to theDevron System. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know you're doing your best, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Slow to impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five yearsago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor, we are merely exploring all the possibilities. Lieutenant Uhnari's logs reported that Commander Morag had beenharassing the station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You didn't say you could do that. Affirmative. Talk to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not necessarily. This could be created by volcanic activity. Lava flows. These walls are dry, Mister Crusher, do you have anymoisture reading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because if I order Data never to divulge what he sees in there,he won't, with the exception of anything that might belong to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It mightgive a clue to the cause of this drought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Donald, your transmission is breaking up. Mister Data, try andclean that up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Send a security team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beamsomeone away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you been treated well, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise is ready, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me what you have now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are aboard the Enterprise, Captain. One seven oh one D. Youhave come twenty two years into the future. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher has no knowledge of any of Starfleet's plans. She's a Medical officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, this Maquis situation has you worried. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol ship, Mister Worf. They should be hailing us soon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not a hero. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Listen to what Shakespeare is telling youabout the man, Data. A king who had a true feeling for his soldierswould wish to share their fears with them on the eve of battle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I just got a message from Starfleet command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. Of course. You're absolutely right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, were you getting tired of my company? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How could they have found out about the rendezvous, Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready roomcan possibly be of interest to future historians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we withdraw, what do you intend to do with the Bajoranvessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign T'Su, situation report. T'SU <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Chief O'Brien, transport this group directly tocargo hold seven, and beam the remaining refugees from the planetdirectly to that hold. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out ofEngineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has to arrived. They haverequested return of the renegades. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any particular reason for this change of heart? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure your fellow Q remember you agreed to never trouble ourspecies again. Just as they're aware you failed to tempt a human tojoin you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think we have seen all there is to see here. At MisterO'Brien's leisure, we're ready to return. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Well done. And well done all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was self-defence. He fired on my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's an herbal tea blend. I, er, found it in the replicatorfiles. Have you met any of the new crewmembers who came aboard atStarbase two eighteen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is our intent to prevent any external power from interferingin Klingon affairs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The knowledge and experience of the humanPicard is part of us now. It has prepared us for all possible coursesof action. Your resistance is hopeless, Number One. First Officer's log, stardate 44001.4. The Borgship has resumed its course toward Earth. We are unable to pursuepending repairs to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it's a likely hypothesis, Number One. If Commander La Forgehas located a second survivor. Lieutenant, hail the Romulan vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, there must be a cure. Some formula, similar to the oldone, <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're doing it for Doctor Reyga, or yourself? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, but where is this place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And it's been determined that they date back to the latenineteenth century? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley. I was an undisciplined,loud-mouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league. Ilearned a very hard, very painful lesson that day, but I learned itwell. I hope you never have to learn it the same way. Care for anothersandwich? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, will you escort Miss Rogers to her quarters? I needto discuss the Tagran's medical needs with Doctor Crusher. And MissRogers? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Her powers are, at the best, unclear. Think about it, MisterWorf. Transporter technology can make things appear and disappear. Theillusion that she can transform herself into a Klingon creature couldbe createdby holographic projection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me apprised. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're right, of course. Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some planet? What are you doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what exactly is Ansata policy with regard to hostages? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state, so wewill treat her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's gogreet our visitors. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are preparing to do so. And, Captain, you're getting a fineofficer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She decided to leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What sort of markings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse impulse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should run a complete diagnostic of all commandsystems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed with the transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome home, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data <eos> <bos> PICARD: Speaking on behalf of men of Earth, which is indeed an awesomeresponsibility, I thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not particularly impressed. All you've done is teach themto enjoy killing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Splendid. Splendid. Carry on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lock phasers. Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, thank you, Mister Data. Procedures require that weinvestigate. Recall the bridge crew and set in a course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any starships ever reported missing in this sector, MisterData? <eos> <bos> PICARD: She was born to do this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excessive honesty can be disastrous, particularly in acommander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're threatening to attack the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what is her heading? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ardra somehow transported me here. Will youbeam me directly to my quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, old friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's very good, but I would like to increase the efficiencyto ninety five percent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm going to go again, only this time I'm going to dress thepart. Why not come with me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you believe that what you saw was some kind of transmission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll lock on and pick you up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forward shields to maximum. Lock phasers on the sentry pods. Prepare to return fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until they found this formula, barely in time. Picard to DoctorCrusher, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I would deeply regret it if you were returning only toease diplomatic tensions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia ofhuman information without knowing a simple word like snoop? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is Pardek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree it would be difficult, but not impossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did he have anything to say about this attack? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I think it best that you and I should return to theholodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will. I put a little something into your bag while you werepacking. I know you'd probably have preferreda bottle of Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. Myvision is blurred. I'm going to get worse, not better. I'm not going tobe able to help you. Now, you are going to have to stand up to Dirgo onyour own. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Tam Elbrun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mrs. Troi, there is something you ought to know about Rex. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker's presentation was devastating. He almost convinced me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think I told you, but I'm glad you're back on theEnterprise. I missed our friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, do you believe that you're in communication with thatobject? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has no intention of stopping. He feels perfectly justifiedin using her until she dies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've lost three plasma relays on the disruptors. Auxiliarypower is, is not available. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Doctor, keep us informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Two, one <eos> <bos> PICARD: A cellular fossil? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Mister Worf, but Starfleetbelieves that the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we get a general status report? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Me, too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what respect? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set in a course for the Vilmoran System. Warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How fast is the wave travelling now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't expect that you would, Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is hard to believe in what one cannot see. And yetconceivably, with their cloaking technology, a fleet of Romulanwarships could be passing before our eyes. There must be some way toneutralise this advantage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I would recommend that before we prepare for combat, wetry to access the ship's logs, find out who we are, what our purposehere might be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Alive? How? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've been talking about it for days. Shore leave for thecrew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want this unit pulled and its systems checked again. I want alevel one diagnostic on all transporters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, I gave you an order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The seabed it may be only partiallyfossilised. It could still contain organic material. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, we've learned the Q do not admire us. The Q has muddledyour mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long would it take to get there at warp nine? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Turn them over to Quinteros. There will be a hearing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorouslibidos. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the Hromi Cluster. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you both. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, what is your status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, set course for Station Nigala Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Doctor, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think we can stay here too long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do <eos> <bos> PICARD: Determine the absolute minimum field energy Doctor Crusherneeds and use the rest to get me onto my Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And be patient. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, take him to Sickbay. Maybe Pulaski can help. Listen to me. You are not alone. Do you understand? We areall in this together now. Captain's log, supplemental. We are monitoringincreased military activity on Solais Five. I fear that without Riva,we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Were you expecting the Ferengi, Premier? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you needed his help at the concert. Or is there possiblysome other logical explanation for what happened that night? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremyfrom his cabin? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep hailing them. All channels, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation is setting up a weather control matrix onHekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice fornow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your father claims quite strenuously that he is innocent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibitedby the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The installation should be about threehundred metres this way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That does not justify brutalising her, nor any of the othersyou have used. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in theother two time periods <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rishon, I can touch you. I can hear your voice, I can smellyour perfume. In every respect you are a real person with your own mindand beliefs, but you do not exist. You died along with the others,defending the colony. He recreated you, just as he recreated the house. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm withtheir disruptors. They've sealed us in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it as good as your report suggests, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where's Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're having a little difficulty on cargo deck five. Yourpresence is requested. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, increase to warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift. When the crewmember walked in, I felt very self-conscious. It's goingto take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the twoof us together. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We may be on a road that has no turns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I got the days confused. I thought it was Tuesday when itwas Wednesday. I went to the Cafe Moulin instead of the Cafe desArtistes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the FederationStarship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How convenient. Except, Number One, I have absolutely nointention of taking a holiday. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I am your friend. I canonly imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know I'mhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll keep you advised, Doctor. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Once again, welcome on board, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's a second energy beam. It's coming from the Enterprisedeflector array. Do you have any idea what that could be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The same thing. But when you moved back toward me it gotbetter. Well, it seems as if we're stuck with each other. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do not answer. It is the rule of the Mek'ba that evidence bepresented in open council. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Thehunt begins, Number One. RIKER <eos> <bos> PICARD: You stay here. Keep warm. I'll go and look for her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you said that you found organic matter in thetemporal aperture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Say when. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying they beamed the Ambassador off our own pad? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you are Borg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What kind of twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terrorinto their lives? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the? <eos> <bos> PICARD: samples by tracing biochemical signatures, we'll be able todetermine who has been in this bay recently. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open toguesses about what we've just met. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If any man, woman or child on this ship is harmed as a resultof your experiment, I will have your head before the highest command inthe Federation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold fire. Mister Crusher, come about to course one four eightzero zero three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you believe him? I want a frank answer, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We almost always encounter shock and fear on this sort ofmission. We hope that you will help us facilitate our introduction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Locate all Earth deep space launches from 2123 until 2190, witha destination in or near the Ficus sector. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, this is as far as I can go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain's log, supplemental. It has beenthree days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contactwith Radue since then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If force is necessary, we will use it, but that will mean wehave failed. Our goal here is to establish some kind of relations withthe Romulans. If we don't succeed, then to convince them of ourresolve. The general feeling at Starfleet is that they are seeking aconfrontation. They may want to test themselves in battle against aFederation starship. See how far we have advanced. If that is the case,then I need to know it. Counsellor, I shall need a full profile onthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not continue have that woman continuing to use this shipfor her convenience, simply because her daughter happens to be one ofmy officers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It will require the cooperation of allconcerned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, of the Federation Starship, USSEnterprise. Why have you attacked my vessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Now look down the sides of the lift. Can you see two bigclamps? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's over, Q! Get us out of here. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you believe I am all-powerful, then you cannot hurt me. If,however, I am telling the truth and I am mortal, you will kill me. Butif the only proof you will believe is my death, then shoot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire the photons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's perfectly normal. Most serious riders do have their ownsaddles. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, if you will let these people go, I'll order the Bridgeto follow your instructions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No need, Number One. Mister Remmick's presence is unnerving, tosay the least. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe that it would be premature to take that action,Mister Worf. There's no real evidence linking these comas with theUllians. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're launching it now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to away team. We're standingby. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I see. He was a colleague of yours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You want to repair them, you'll have to learn to do ityourselves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Friends, close friends, are few and farbetween. Two of the oldest and closest are Jack Crusher, may he rest inpeace, and Walker Keel. Before various missions split us apart, we werevirtually inseparable. I trust Keel completely. If he felt it necessaryto violate regulations, he must have had a good reason. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kamala. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much time will these adjustmentsrequire, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Oh, perhaps I could reconfigure these isolinear chips. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why are you keeping me locked in this freighter? You say thatthere are wild animals out there but I haven't heard or seen a singleone of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, it's nothing. It's just a, just a mild headache. Thecorrect procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal the Bridge of yourfinding immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, evenunder these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering. Get the core back online. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn'tfunction by conjecture. <eos> <bos> PICARD: New cases? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then, Ensign Crusher, set course for the Epsilon Sector, warpfive. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independentreading. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Holodeck off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was your vessel's designation and its complement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? I haven't a clue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what has the scientist been up to today? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Astrophysics Centre on Icor Nine is holding a symposium onrogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, time is the one thingwhich we do not have in abundance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for thepast three days? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who might havebeen in cargo bay four today. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please keep working at it. We may need it soon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware thatsomething strange is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This leader of theirs, Conor, he seems to be a reasonable man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seal off all decks. Lock on transporters to the intrudersignals. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impudence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh. Have I been the subject of conversation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which requires I now ask you a very serious question. Since thetwo of you are closely related to each other. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have a business proposition to discuss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Certainly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. But if the Duras are being aided by the Romulans, itbecomes very much our concern. The Romulans have been attempting todestroy the Klingon-Federation Alliance for the past twenty years. Atthe same time, the Duras have been secretly conspiring with theRomulans. Doesn't it strike you as odd that the Duras are able to fieldsuch an overpowering force against Gowron? That they outmatch him atalmost every turn? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, identify. What is a QE Two? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Without warp capacity, we're just a floating target. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not in the slightest. Except for his features, there is nothingabout him that I find familiar. Counsellor, I want you to stay withhim. He will be able to communicate with you before any on else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that won't be known until combat begins. You're right,Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, wecould overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A strategic attaché with specialised knowledge in the frontierregions. I think you'll find the briefing interesting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can't. And I won't. Unless I have unequivocal cooperation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's his father's son. Honest, trusting, strong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain! Donald, come in! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tactical analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're goingto have to put up with me for a long time to come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know. Lieutenant, understand that I am not unmindful of themixed feelings you must have about this incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. This is their preferred way of space travel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, whoever you are, I can hear you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then her safety must be very important to you. Give us time todetermine what is going on happened here. That way we can minimise therisks in bringing her to you. You wouldn't want to lose her because weacted too quickly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suppose you'll just have to go down there and find out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, launch four Class A probes toward the planets. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge. Well, I have a little work tofinish up, then I'm going to my cabin. I'm going to put my feet up, I'mgoing to turn on my personal relaxation light and I'm going to losemyself in the pages of some old novel. What about you, Number One? You've earned a rest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My experience suggests that they would ignore him. Would youagree? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, did you get them off? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there is so much to gain and there is so little to lose bythe effort. The problem affects us all. It cannot be ignored. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Whydoesn't he do something? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I still don't know what to make of it. Wasit a dream? Was it one of Q's elaborate tricks? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now Idon't think I have any other choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wake him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Federation could wind up buying a proverbial lemon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you wanted to run tests on Kahless, you should have sent aKlingon ship for him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Ensign, lay in a course to Starbase one two nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is this the man you saw? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Traveller moved through time using the power of his mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What I said, DaiMon Tarr, is <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will agree, Data, that Starfleet'sorders are difficult? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Away team, now. What is happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. Weare not the enemy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We would require no special attention. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any way I can? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that so? Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez, I think it will besimpler if I simply change my uniform. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And is that why they can't conceive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would leave you defenceless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Her society is aware that there is interstellar life? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that's a little premature. We hardly know anythingabout each other. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does it pose a danger to the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, come with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's quite right. And as I'm supposed to be dead, I'll go andget some sleep. And, Mister Data, I suggest that you escort CommanderRiker to the brig. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign DeSeve, you promised me a freighterwith an important cargo. The only thing here is empty space. Do youhave an explanation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Archaeology Council. Welcome. Mystery. It is the mystery of Tagus Three that brings ustogether today. It is a mystery that has invited more argument, morededuction, more speculation than the best works of fiction. And ifyou'll excuse the conceit, I want to tell you about my detective story. For several years now, I have been trying to unravel the secrets ofTagus Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are no local authorities. The government is splintered. It seems that there are various factions vying for power. They'redesperate for weapons or technology of any kind. Apparently, some ofthe factions have resorted to torture to gather their information. Well, a Starfleet research team would be a prime target. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry about this Gu, Gloria. I didn't actually mean you toget involved. She knows nothing about this, Johnny. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I need water. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do they want with the Enterprise? What's their purpose? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you are who you say you are, then you have nothing to lose. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, yes, er, the rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my troupe arein rehearsals for a new production. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, help him up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riker! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is hereby nullified. I don't want your help, your advice, yourfavours or for that matter, you. Do you understand? Once and for all! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your lawyer has been dead for centuries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't go that far. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kolrami, you have been nothing but denigrating andabusive of Commander Riker since coming aboard this ship. Now I wouldlike some explanation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to be back at this asteroid at oh eight hundred hourstomorrow. Plan your search pattern accordingly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, this is all very interesting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The two Ornarans are really quite ill and insisting that theyneed felicium. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge officers. We're approaching the Devidiasystem. Report to your stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Number One, let's go and welcome the Admiral aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many generations are we dealing with here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I'll see you in a few minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The legend will die, but the people will live. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not sure. Mister Worf, what is my rank and position? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were not off the cruiser. They were from the freighterBatris. The leader is Captain Korris. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In return for some pain you'd given other creature? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's blast full power into warp nine. Ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. There is something else to keep in mind. We are deep inTalarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. I'm goingto agree to the meeting. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the Tamarian ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Welcome back, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you have just said there are only two challengers arriving. What is the point? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He said that he was down there recently. He seemed confidentthat it could be done safely. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe. But she, or someone like her, will always be with us,waiting for the right climate in which to flourish, spreading fear inthe name of righteousness. Vigilance, Mister Worf, that is the price wehave to continually pay. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, standby for a jump to warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. Whatdo the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll do all that we can to help them but in the meantime Iwant them kept under surveillance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Premier Bhavani has no objection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Except it's illegal. It's in violation of an agreement that theFederation signed in good faith. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evidently, you were abducted two days afterbeaming to the surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with youfor a moment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's reassuring. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What makes you say that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't own the Enterprise, I command her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, then I hope to see you tonight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. How do I do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you account for this discrepancy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the dust? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that it's time I met Commander Sela. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seriously, how do you plan to accelerate the buildup on theunderside of the mantle without increasing the stress on the tectonicplates? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's your status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. Have Commander Riker come to my Ready room assoon as he's on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange. I would expect Betazoids to be outstanding animaltrainers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Merde. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make a full scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'd be happy to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven'tyou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course we did. But in the end we may have proved just asdangerous to that colony as any core fragment could ever have been. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now,tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroyhumanity? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I think he is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And deadly. I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am aware of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not if you aren't guilty, Simon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Arkaria Base, this is Captain Picard. Deactivate the baryonsweep immediately! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we'll can talk about it later. For now, I think we shouldget off this planet. Am I in assuming the damage the shuttle is not asbad as it seems? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, there's plenty of time for that. You may decide to dosomething else as you get older. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, I'm your cha'DIch. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, maybe you should consider letting her go ahead with this genetronic procedure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us inhis place would be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you think of the Enterprise D? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Even with all these uncertainties, we've got to try. Takewhatever steps are necessary to send a message. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you looking for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard implicitly trusted you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No longer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It seemed, Admiral, that they knew ourcourse, our destination, our plan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono, you're not going to die at my hands or anyone else's. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Away team, prepare to return to the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, find out everything you canabout the destruction of the Khitomer outpost. Cross reference withRomulan tactics and strategic information on the region, and requestaccess to the Klingon central information net. Computer, presentationoverview of Klingon custom and law pertaining to familialaccountability. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. You will respond to my questions. This isgoing nowhere. Doctor, I want an autopsy performed on the other one. Compare the differences with what we learned of Hugh's anatomy. See ifthere have been any recent modifications which might explain thesebehavioural differences. Data, run a biospectral analysis on this Borg. See if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful andbenevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years. Ventax Two must have offered her the greatest opportunity of hernefarious career. She learned of the myth of Ardra, studied it andexpertly played on your fears that your people were ready to virtuallysurrender to her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you really think using their identities would gain oursympathy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Doyou remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zoneto investigate a spatial anomaly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Meaning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We've arranged a demonstration to illustrate. Mister La Forge,I think it's about time, isn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Riva id deaf. These three speak for him. Treat them asinterpreters. Address yourselves directly to Riva. Now, may I presentmy First Officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Find them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll discuss your situation with Captain Endar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we help them? Is there any way we can moderate the powertransfer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any evidence to support this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, protocol may have been lax on your last assignment, buthere on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna, no matter how long it takes, we will get out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, set course zero fiveeight, mark one seven three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted, but how could he perceive his mother visually as ifshe were standing there in the room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back where it belongs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is not our planet, sir, but I will present your needs tothose who do govern this world. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp five. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assemble your away party, Commander. This must be an excitingmoment for you, Mister Data. I'm tempted to lead the away team myself,except that my First Officer would object. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What shall it be, Tomalak? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Father. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quitecommon in many different cultures. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guilty. Provisionally. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: No! The challenge is unequivocally refused! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, put up the shields until further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None that I can see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good to have you back, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello. Smells good. Thank you. Thisis a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Are youone of the crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Passenger accommodation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell him what happened, Narik. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, will you handle this at security station, decknine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the devil is going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, how bad is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp without warp drive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I agree this is highly unlikely, but we have to proceedwith our current dilemma as though Q is powerless to prevent it, don'twe? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Satarrans' weapons technology is no more advanced than theLysians'. One photon torpedo would have ended their war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here we have Environmental and Engineering stations, missionoperations, and the two principal science stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest.  HAGON <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I will change into some appropriate costume. Uniforms mightpose questions I'd rather he didn't ask. It seems that he feeds onknowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information thanwe have to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can get back there and destroy that site, it might put anend to their time travelling. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because it's been given a name by a member of my crew doesn'tmean it's not a Borg. Because it's young doesn't mean that it'sinnocent. It is what it is, and in spite of efforts to turn it intosome kind of pet I will not alter my plans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll check the fuel consumption logs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course, Number One. Just a little preoccupied. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Activate impulse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, pull all relevant information with regard toStarfleet regulations on the transfer of officers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Battle alert, Mister Crusher. Condition Yellow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deception? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Somewhat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do yousense an alien presence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, may I take off the uniform for a moment? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set your phaser to heavy stun. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explains what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: New heading two nine nine mark one eight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To be sure of what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you won't. Beverly, you know I loathe vacations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite right, Prime Minister. Enterprise, prepare to beam theaway team back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That would take us in the wrong direction. Our mission is to goforward, and it's just begun. Set velocity. Warp six, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room, do you have a fix on the away team? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before we have warp power again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where do you want to go? Do you want to try to find those wholeft you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, how long before the stormreaches the outposts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent theCommander to me when he's finished. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How interesting. So are we. Perhaps we could combine ourefforts and share our findings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starshipEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you seen anything like that before? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you saying you believe it to be hostile? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, the person in question is in his quarters at the moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, one does not beam down to Starfleet Headquarters armed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well that is your protected right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought hereagainst my will. Wherever here is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Room One, lock on to Professor Galen and transporthim directly to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, you're using our files on theKhitomer massacre as evidence against Duras' father? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps some day we will discover that space and time aresimpler than the human equation. No coordinates laid in, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we all die, here, now, you will not be able to gloat. Youwanted to frighten us. We're frightened. You wanted to show us that wewere inadequate. For the moment, I grant that. You wanted me to say Ineed you. I need you! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection, Your Honour, I want this read. All of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't want them disrupting thisconference. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to hearyou talk about your career. I'm sure you would have some fascinatinginsights into the events of your time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full stop, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, are there any members of the crew of the Enterprisemissing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Intact, for the most part. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Married? She's getting married? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain Garrett. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do you mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a complication. Maybe we should ask them to join us inthis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But shouldn't the safety overrides have prevented that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So it would seem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Promise me you will try and stay out of trouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doesn't love always begin that way? With the illusion beingmore real than the woman? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Professor. It's good to see you again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your objection is noted, Mister Worf, but we are directlyresponsible for the death of the parent. We cannot simply wash ourhands of it now. Doctor, we will proceed at your discretion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They've declared war on our way of life. We are to beassimilated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusherwill explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss thismission with anyone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is an understatement, Number One. The last time I sawCommander Flaherty, he spoke forty languages. As I recall, among themore exotic were Romulan, Klingon, Giamon, Stroyerian. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, override the shuttle's computer. Return it to theshuttlebay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdictionhere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Clara, if we need your help again, I hope we can count on you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is everything all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your computer had safety precautions. There is nothing youcould have touched that would have damaged your ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not bad. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, take command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you sure? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not the whole meaning, but it is part of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Logical. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood, Lieutenant, but I suspect that Commander Riker isprobably perfectly safe, at least in a physical sense. Q has aninterest in him. In fact, Q's entire visit has something to do with ourFirst Officer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Mister Worf, throw him in the brig. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This transmitter module has been totally destroyed. How couldthat happen? It looks as though it's been hit by a phaser blast. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long would you say they've been there, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased. We will report as soon as our mission isaccomplished. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpretingthe symbols and images of your dreams. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Sheliak won't bargain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Riker? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's just that I'm getting older. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was concerned. I came to see if I could be of any help. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Intercept. Warp two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join youthis evening. If there's room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's happening to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasytruce with the Moropa, are they not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You expect me to apologise to you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a feedback loop. Youcertainly can say. You have free will, you have a choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This disc must contain some very valuable information. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you help us locate him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I believe our best chance of escaping this situation is for meto pilot the shuttle. It's my ship, Will. I've got to do this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps so. Anything is possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, that sounds like a telephone ringer, but I don't seea receiver. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Admiral, there's no betterguide into this life for Lal than Data. He's doing an excellent job. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She might be able to persuade the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And this? You have no other portraits of your fellow crewmembers. Why this person? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So he did, but don't depend too much on any single viewpoint Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Crusher. Set course to rendezvous with the Hood. Warpeight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, while we still have some power left, itis time for difficult decisions. Opinions please. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Penny, er, do you think we could just talk for a while. I don'tknow anything about you. Where you're from, what your interests are,your last name. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A bad love affair ends in a bloodyshoot-out, the hotel gets bought out, and life goes on, such as it is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll have to make course changes manuallyuntil we re-establish the connection. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's nothing unusual about that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't believe you speak for the majority of the crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. This will be fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory,the sense of individuality which he has gained here might betransmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of theBorg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling ofsingularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious programme of all. Theknowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that briefmoment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland, I assume you can manoeuvre it home? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think you've got a great deal to learn from Starfleet. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have sent down what we call an away team to make peacefulcontact here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst forthe formation of a temporal rift. History has no record of your battlewith the Romulans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I mustremember not to let this happen again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cease Red Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't know what the enemy needed, Doctor. Love? Fear? Hope? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Everything we do tightens its grip. Let's see what we canlearn. Launch a Class one probe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We? For whom else do you speak? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Helm take us in to twenty millionkilometres. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? I'm on my way to look in on your patient. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, where exactly is the location? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him,but I cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to actas the computer. I don't care how smart he is. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They very nearly did. Mister Locarno made an impassioned pleafor the rest of you. He said that he'd used his influence as squadronleader to convince you to attempt the Kolvoord manoeuvre and then tocover up the truth. He asked to take full responsibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh no, no, there'll be plenty of time for that. We don'tarriving at Tilonus for another five days. And besides, if you backout, she'll come after me to play the part. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, hold. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Peace and long life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I wonder if you can possibly help me with something. I havebeen able to translate most of the writing on these two pieces For themost part, they're warnings of death and destruction to anyone whoopposes the resonator, but I am not able to determine what appears onthe anterior side. For example, this symbol represents the Vulcan godof war and this is the god of death, but if you look really carefully,you can see a third symbol missing. Now that obviously should belong tothe final piece. Now what's odd about this is that the gods of deathand war would typically always stand alone on an artefact. They wouldnever be combined with a third glyph. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of 'Demons of Air andDarkness'. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it's time that you and I had a talk with Maques. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, please acknowledge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Data. Lock onto the beacon. Keep it dead astern. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, are all your systems functioning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Friendship must dare to risk, Counsellor, or it's notfriendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Same question. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tholl, I asked her to open the door. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where are myweapons? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We now commit the body of Ira Graves to the timeless depths ofspace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set a course to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get it to Sickbay right away. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold on, it won't be long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I heard about the incident with Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Warp eight, any heading. Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And those same waves have been randomly striking differentareas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generatorchanges. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status of download, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are still investigating that. As soon as <eos> <bos> PICARD: Defector? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Will you come along? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher will monitor our responses. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. How many ofyour men do you want to accompany you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A most significant step. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's the next step, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf must have overridden the sensor codes, played someholographic games. Mister Data, input a new code. Attack posture, circumvental attitude. Prepare beams for photon mode. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cancel auto-destruct. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you do the modifications? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be right there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oppido bonum. Your Latin has improved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That can't be helped. Ensign, lay in a course. Warp factoreight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Scan for survivors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said that the transporter could be modified to filter outthe changes in Doctor Pulaski? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? We just wentinto warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But surely, Captain, you have regulations to take care of suchan eventuality. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will the probe be able to transmit through that interference? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Right. Now this is something that I first tasted on ThelkaFour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I stand relieved. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reassemble in Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out. Manoeuvring thrusters only. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold for my orders. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Close enough, however, to see we're not there. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you picking up any readings from Melona? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Elaborate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Lysians have identified CommanderMacDuff as a Satarran, an alien race that's been at war with theLysians for decades. I have conveyed our deepest regrets to the Lysiansover the tragedy of their lost ship and crew. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to apotentially dangerous procedure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's so, then there are opportunities awaiting you thatare beyond anything you have ever imagined. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long before the waveovertakes us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That seems rather risky, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The medical records are our next priority. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do I? You should never have interfered. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. How long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Poison? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Korgano? Who is that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They willaccept no one else. How can we confirm your diagnosis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep this channel open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm the captain of a Federation starship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm re-routing the secondary deuteriumsupply. Switching to manual control. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, where are you off to now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, see that the representatives are safelytransported off the ship. Ensign, set a course to intercept with theTrill ship. Prepare to go to warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. But not the second time. Now, you'll do me the courtesy ofjoining us at dinner. I have to disappoint an old friend. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All decks, all stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. We'll use the Jefferies tube. Let's go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my command. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By whom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can possibly avoid firing on it, I would hope it would beMARR <eos> <bos> PICARD: It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok'sship. This could all soon be over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, did you get my message? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We beamed them up an hour ago. They're fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your Captain is acting on an assumption, Will, and I'm not surewhat the result will be, or even that my assumption is correct. Wefound two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there wasonly one survivor of the war on Rana Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have you done to Commander Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We were hoping that you could tell us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure that after a while you'll be able to adjust. They saywhen one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to compensate. A blind man develops better hearing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, can we try again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tholl, what I want is for everyone to escape! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, perhaps you had better re-examine the Array. Seeif you can find any evidence to support Mister Worf's claims. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, have tractor beams standing by. We may have totake them under tow. Helm, take us within tractor range. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you violate it, you may jeopardising your career. Starfleetdoesn't take these matters lightly, Will. I can't defend you if you gotoo far. Do you understand that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why did you leave the Earth and come to a brand new planet whenyou did? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us to impulse power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, will you escort Investigator Krag to TransporterRoom Three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Let's pay a call, get some answers. Number One, MisterData. Mister La Forge, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Marta Batanides. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not allow my people to entertain you until you do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, how long before we begin the transfer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Kurland! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not going to let you waste this. This is more valuable tous as a coolant or disinfectant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some other time, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now that we know how each of us feels, perhaps we should not beafraid to explore those feelings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will be the first to cheer when the Neutral Zone isabolished. But I wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshapethe entire Romulan political landscape. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Jeremy, Wesley'sfather died on a Starfleet mission when he was younger than you are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are three Romulans, all of them with disruptors. One atconn. There are none of our security officers on the Bridge. They musthave taken us by surprise. It appears that we can move objects in thistime frame. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And her vital signs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to that communications array. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please, organise it into brief answers to my questions. We havevery little time. Do they accept our presence at this planet? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wesley, you are going to have to keep a rein on Dirgo. He'swilful and stubborn. That's dangerous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Daren. About these thermal deflectors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We haven't done any analysis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The beast? There was a creature at Tanagra? Darmok and Jalad,the beast of Tanagra. They arrived separately. They struggled togetheragainst a common foe, the beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad atTanagra. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a nice place to visit, Number One, but I wouldn't wantto die there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security to Transporter room two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging theFederation into a Klingon civil war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myselfwith the surroundings. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what is the state of the shuttle crew? <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Barre, France. Captain's log, stardate 46360.8. The negotiationswith the Cardassians have made little progress. I believe a militaryconfrontation may be unavoidable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To all Starfleet personnel, this is theCaptain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew,Ensign Sito Jaxa <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not here to fight your wars for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should stay here for the night. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If huts are better, why did you once live in caves? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do not continue to enlist the cooperation of Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I read you, Commander. Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, yourplanet has been conquered six times! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Location? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For the moment. Can you tell me if Deanna's incident is relatedin any way to this missing time period? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Velocity dropping. Thermal shields at full power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems. Atthe moment, we are adrift. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's something more. You're laughing, but actually you'reembarrassed by that incident. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are capable of recreating all of these events. It's justthat she dresses them up and she delivers them with more dramaticflair. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And, Mister Worf? I hope you find what you're looking for. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thought? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm very sorry, Mister Leech, but we have to be going. Callagain tomorrow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, put the planet on the main viewer. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll both go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kahlest? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, sowhat if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? Do you? Do you? Well, that's the question you have to answer. Your Honour, thecourtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we areleft with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later,this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regardthis creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people weare, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroomand this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries ofpersonal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagelycurtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all whocome after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet wasfounded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanteda chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, he has access to the computer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You can see your quarters now, if you like. Will you show theMillers to their accommodations, please, and I shall join you later. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, we are, Number One. What is your status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, I must, as a matter of fact, be getting back to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I mean now, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No? Then she must have destroyed all the weapons on the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, lock onto the scout ship. Take it in tow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, that's a Benzite trait. It's been suggested that anofficer from the Enterprise might participate in the programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sound general quarters. Clear corridors ofall non-essential personnel. I don't want him taking any hostages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you still know how to work it. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I believe that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the least I can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There have been nine hundred and forty seven knownarchaeological excavations conducted on the planet's surface. Of those,some seventy four are generally believed to have revealed findings ofmajor importance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, perhaps you're right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Earl Grey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All decks? Everything? The entire ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Once? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You had no claim to that vessel. It was ours to destroy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trillions? I've never heard the word Tkon before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your threats are meaningless now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I noticed several times during the briefing that you appearedto be a bit distracted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's isolate and magnify that system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, find out if anything similar happened in thissector. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. Wehave engaged the Borg. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien was the one who safely executed the return ofthe away team. He's the most qualified person on board to operate thetransporters under these circumstances. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hear you've been promoted to supervisor of the Atlantisproject. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Noted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Theorise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We haven't completed our analysis of thebomb debris. Doctor Crusher is still studying the remains of the twomen killed in the explosion. We need more time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Eighteen years? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reverse engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course you know that is out of the question. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. This is the Enterprise. Captain Jean Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a stupid mistake. The Nausicaan didn't take kindly tolosing. Nor his friends. They were outraged. They wanted a fight. Igave them one. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, you can serve from within either ofthese two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that topcentre target. You have to return the ball before it bounces twice. Alright? Let's try it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only question I have, Admiral, is why you thought itnecessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages. Evenwilling to put your life at risk for it. I'll be on the Bridge,Admiral, if you want to talk further. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data! <eos> <bos> PICARD: How will you keep us a secret when so many have seen and heardso much? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we can't go back and we can't stay here. We've got tokeep going for the mountains. No matter what is waiting there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How the hell do you know that, boy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand your position, but I', sure you're aware that theFederation cannot interfere in what is, by definition, an internalKlingon affair. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulans know that as well as we do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I have business there. I shall accompany you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Picard representing the United Federation ofPlanets. Guinan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remmick! <eos> <bos> PICARD: You heard the order, Mister Lynch. Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bags of mostly water? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not necessarily to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, what is it, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes thatthe Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility ofanything closer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Risk? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Send it through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. Mister Crusher, engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Mister Sabin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can assure you that is not the case. We're doing everythingin our power to control them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, you are hereby assigned to Q for the remainder ofhis stay. You will escort him to Mister La Forge in Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analyse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It means they plan on keeping us here for a while. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Well, I'd better let you finish up so you can get offthe ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chorgan, I think you will find Marouk's proposal <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There was no mention of an escort. Request a security clearancecode. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have no functional propulsion systems? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's where I'll be. Number One. Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The danger is minimal, Number One. Chorgan is unlikely to doanything rash with the Enterprise's phasers trained on his ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Clark, we are barely able maintain communication withyou. Can you boost the level of your power source? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Analysis, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My only regret is that it took us three years to find asuitable sun after you had first contacted us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, whoever they are, and however they survived, we've got toget them off the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. As long as they're looking for us, they won't hurt anyoneelse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, gentlemen, your theories on thissudden vulnerability of these systems. DATA <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible that this malfunction will affect the otherholodecks as well? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The only one remaining is the one that needs no conversation. The only one we must avoid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In five days, you have seen only the most superficial evidenceof what life is like outside this biosphere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The advantage is, thatit will appear from the Kreechta's perspective as thoughyou were destroyed in theexplosion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've made a mistake. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sovereign, we can at least acknowledge that Chorgan appearswilling to discuss your offer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And nothing shameful in a strategic retreat, either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Obviously, he's trying to alter the programming here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? Children on the Enterprise? Guinan, we're at war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, fine, good, let's throw the Prime Directive to thewinds. Let's detain her against her will. Let's destroy any chance ofpeace between these worlds. Let's interfere in their society, theircustoms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do we know about them, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easyto spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are wellcamouflaged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between thisculture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going toimprovise. Mister Worf, what's our status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bring him home, Number One. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data launched that probe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Chief, and well done. That'll be all. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, get us back to Aldea. Warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, what got us here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thrill? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not possible. We're expected at Pacifica, <eos> <bos> PICARD: It may be dangerous to take the ship in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but Ican offer you assistance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I look forward to sampling them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is alive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's history fulfilling itself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We sustained some minor damage. Do you know what happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because your presence gives me potential access to a kind ofinformation that I've never had available to me before, and if I am tore-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possibleasset. It would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Apparently he's confined in some sort of force field. Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. But youall right though? <eos> <bos> PICARD: At the moment of separation, we willreverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead andclear of us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have confidence in the self-control of my crew, Kamala, butthere are guests and civilians on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acamarians? Then that would suggest the Gatherers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our momentum is still carrying us into thepath of the stellar matter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excellent. We will transmit the information shortly. Enterpriseout. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, werethey? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A long time to wait to see if you're right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, to transporter room three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, activate Picard Mozart trio,programme one. Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan? I must talk to youabout Spock. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, bon voyage, Mister Scott. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was my error, not hers. Chancellor, there is no starshipmission more dangerous than that of first contact. We never know whatwe will face when we open the door on a new world, how we will begreeted, what exactly the dangers will be. Centuries ago, a disastrouscontact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decidedthen we would do surveillance before making contact. It was acontroversial decision. I believe it prevented more problems than itcreated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, any analysis of those bolts of light it emits? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipationcould not be stopped. What did you hope to accomplish by assistingthese people? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's one possibility. Mister Worf, bring Ensign DeSeve to myReady room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What would you have me tell them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Open up the transporters in Cargo bay two and diverteveryone from deck seven to there. That should put it back on track. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I just see a different big picture, Admiral. It lookssomething like this. I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassianvirus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion Four. Nowwe have a common enemy, he says. The Bajoran terrorists. TheCardassians can't find them, but maybe the Federation can. I'mbeginning to see that our mission has, in fact, been to expose Orta sothat the Cardassians can move in and destroy him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lasers can't even penetrate our navigation shields. Don't theyknow that? RIKER <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, Gamma Tauri Four is recognised by allcivilised members of <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his lifesearching for the Tox Uthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yours is a different world. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Their condition? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wrong, Number One. It was almost the longest. Well done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Simultaneously? All eighteen? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, you have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not hunters, Doctor. Nor is it our role to exact revenge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. You and Data beam down. Locate the power source ofthat shield. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans until you're ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long were we out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have fought a pitched battle with it, and lost. Many of mycrew have been injured including a woman who's mind is slowly beingdestroyed by telepathic manipulation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer areincompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time ofwar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trilithium resin is a highly toxic wasteproduct produced by our engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'llbe ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, acknowledge the signal from New Berlin andtransmit another copy of Starfleet's ship-recognition protocols andtell them to read it this time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pursuant to paragraph one thousand two hundred and ninety, Ihereby formally request third party arbitration of our dispute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What race are you? Where are you from? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in heretogether. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then that would explain why they abandoned it. But if there'sno one still living there, how were we brought inside? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explanation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, I'm not convinced the boy has been abused, Doctor. I've talked with the father, and if I am any judge of character, Iwould say that he deeply cares for the boy's welfare. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, that. No, no, back. Yes, that. Right there. What is that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't know when to tell them we will be there. Is ourbusiness with the J'naii finished? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Keep me appraised, Commander. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What a language. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Wait. The plan failed because clues were left behind thatsuggested a mystery. And to many humans, a mystery isirresistible. It must be solved. The Doctor's incubation experiment,Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations. Little pieces of evidence thatsuggested even more clues. The clock, the transporter trace, Data's oddbehaviour. If we eliminate the clues and begin again <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide. Weboth want peace in the Demilitarised Zone. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to see neutral representative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you're asking, you're asking me to restrict Mister Tarses'movements solely on the basis on Sabin's feeling. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders? How? Duringthe missing day, were you contacted by Starfleet? Did they order you toconceal the truth from us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm in no mood for your foolishness, Q. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explanation, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't have anything to do. None of the games are working. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can the old form still be used? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Off the bridge! Both of you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in acontinuous cycle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew havereturned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site onDevidia Two. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of aspatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in theNeutral Zone. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I intruding? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, I want to make absolutely surethat you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving upyour status as Federation citizens, any future request you or yourpeople make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your ownand under Cardassian jurisdiction. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's get them off there. T'Jon, stand by to beam over. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lower your weapons or Bok is dead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Let's get on with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, I don't understand. What has happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is any of this possible? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Position report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you were a member of my crew, sir, I would <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have completed our survey on the surface. Analysing thatdata will keep us busy for a while. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Data, the nearest pulsar is inthe Lonka cluster, is it not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number three sixnine B. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you may have brought it aboard this ship. Was there amedical scan when they transported? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put this on the main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Trouble, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, she appears to be your mother, but she is not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something has seized their ship too. They're in the samepredicament as us. Launch a sensor probe. Set it to searchfor the source of whatever this something is that is holding bothships. Go back to hailingfrequency, fast. And I regret, DaiMon Tarr, that I can no longernegotiate unless it isconducted visually. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're a very attractive woman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I want you to sever the contact with Drema Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you wait outside? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good morning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll advise you further as soon as you reachyour destination, Number One. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll deal with that when the timecomes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Dismissed. Geordi? I'm very sorry that you didn't find yourmother. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will leave and never return. Chancellor, we are here only tohelp guide you into a new era. I can assure you we will not interferein the natural development of your planet. That is, in fact, our PrimeDirective. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, based on your analysis, whatis the current Romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships inthis sector? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What were the readings for? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, report to my Ready room. My guest is departing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister Worf. 1 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, I would like you to make Timothy the best android he canpossibly be. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me informed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've heard of him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Frightening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh ninehundred hours. We'll discuss it then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where has he gone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have to go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise and I see no reason why I should answer to you. Cardassians have no claims in this sector. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Let's talk. Are you here to relieve me of duty? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This culture will be assimilated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With regard to the surrender, DaiMon Tarr. The facts aresomewhat different. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, explain Red Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you always accustomed to getting your way, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf, relay the prefix codes of the Phoenixto the Cardassian warship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No, no, no, no. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're waiting for us back at Sherwood Forest. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long timeago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. Iwas talking to Beverly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full weapon systems. Lock on. Open a hailing frequency. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are not to blame. What happened appears to have been thework of onedesperate man. It may not reflect the feelings of the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may take whatever action against him you feel isappropriate. I consider the matter closed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whatever it is, why do you demonstrate it through thisconfrontation? Why not a simple, direct explanation, a statement ofwhat you seek? Why these games? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, assemble the senior staff and goto Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Qapla', Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nobody's going in there until we have done a full sensoranalysis. I want to do everything possible to determine that it's safe,and when I am satisfied, then you, Data, and Commander La Forge willenter the wormholetomorrow. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the safety of theship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've already betrayed your people, Admiral. You've made yourchoices, sir. You're a traitor. Now, if the bitter taste of that isunpalatable to you, I am truly sorry. But I will not risk the lives ofmy crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the NeutralZone. You've crossed over, Admiral. You make yourself comfortable withthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, please sit down. Well, we have a problem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because I don't know who or what you are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the surface. Counsellor, any thoughts? <eos> <bos> PICARD: From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for anyreason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try andtake them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship cando. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximumacceleration. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Request an explanation of your actions, DaiMon Goss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, get Mister O'Brien. Take that transportersystem apart piece by piece if you have to. Mister Worf, I want a levelthree security alert until further notice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is a hell of a time. Whatever it is, I don't want it toaffect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest ofthe crew until we've identified the cause. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A captain's log? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates, plot a course into the chasm, manoeuvringthrusters only. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The ship was controlled from the ground. Communication washandled through a subspace relay on board the vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can boost the output field, I might be able to send adistress signal. Something seems to be wrong with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forty five years ago he made the wrong decision. He wanted tocome here to somehow right it, to atone for what he did. Now all he cando is to give himself up to you. He brought this retribution onhimself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, how dangerous would another ridethrough the inverter be to us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, no. I've come here to prevail upon your intelligenceand your insight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mentioned a hospitalisation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The foreign investors in the book aredescribed as flamboyantly generous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Return at once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it appears, for reasons unknown, someone has gone to greatpains to erase all traces of this man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A telepathic weapon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are we talking about hallucinations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I understand. But I just want you to know I'm available if youshould change your mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Noted, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was wondering, Mister La Forge. What's our engineefficiency status? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, open the lower band frequencies most commonly usedin the last century. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about males? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's try and find out. Computer, download all informationregarding signal beacon from Starbase mainframe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm taking this up with you, Will! The Judge Advocate thoughtyou were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Now, whatthe hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why isPressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm on my way, sir. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is going on here, Number One? Did yougive him permission to contact me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached outto the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? Tothe danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge! Stand by to transport. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, status report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe it was all part of the Bynar's programming. But you know,Number One, some relationships just can't work. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you predict how long this has been in the cavern? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise has been caught in temporal causality loop, andI suspect that something similar may have happened to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Objection. There are many life forms possessed of megastrength. These issues are not relevant to this hearing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In our travels, we have encountered many other creatures,perhaps even stranger-looking than ourselves. But we try to co-existpeacefully with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jono. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It doesn't appear to be, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The entire orchestra? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Possibly. Just as we're checking it out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Guinan, your people have been in this part of the galaxy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, my God. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You never intended to burn that second disc. If you had, youwouldn't have been so careless as to allow Sovak to salvage any of it. You wanted him to follow us, so that he could see for himself that theUthat wasn't at the cave site. That was the only way he could beconvinced that your quest had been futile. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're responsible for new starship development. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, keep at it. I have to tell him that we are making someprogress. Mister La Forge. Do you have any idea how Moriarty could havegained control of the ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your point is well taken, Mister Data. I'm sure that to theAntedeans, we are equally unattractive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't see any alternative, do you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A single Data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity. Awonder, even. But thousands of Datas. Isn't that becoming a race? Andwon't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now, tell me, Commander,what is Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Riker has been to see me to talk about the awaymission. He believes that the only way to retrieve the database is bydirectly accessing the main core underneath the station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you prepared to hear her evidence in open council? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Besides, Tasha was a child when this woman was born. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. Now, when they give way, we shall fall. So you'vegot to get your crew out of here before that happens. Now, there is aladder along the wall of the shaft. You can climb up that until youcome to an open doorway. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impractical and provocative. Even assuming that we have thepower to sustain such a tactic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, what could have caused this collision of time andanti-time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase to warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, where is Doctor Pulaski. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it through. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, verify our position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, what are you doing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Shut it off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied to himabout the Engine Room. There were no volatile chemicals found there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Well, I look forward to it. Excuse me. Commander, we needto begin a full spectrographic analysis of the Dyson Sphere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want, Sirol? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This entire mystery started when our sensors detected thatplanet. First it was class-M, now it isn't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think so, Mister Data. Let's go on with the files. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Screen off. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is everyone else all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have all the information I need for our report. Your prisonerhas been returned to you and you have a decision to make. Whether totry to force them back or welcome them home. In your own words, this isnot our affair. We cannot interfere in the natural course of yoursociety's development, and I'd say it's likely to develop significantlyin the nextseveral minutes. It's been an interesting visit. When you're ready formembership, the Federation will be pleased to reconsider yourapplication. Mister Riker, four to beam up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What if he's not alone? What if he brings some of his Nausicaanfriends with him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, are you ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's possible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One of the finest officers that I have ever served with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I asked for Commander Riker's report, Acting Ensign Crusher. And since it now seems clear that you are unable to function within thelimits of that appointmentLAFORGE <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't speak to you for months. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He has this unique ability of instantaneously interpreting andextrapolating any verbal communication that he hears. You will find himvery useful in Sector Vega-Omicron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Allenby, full stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then sending them back would be a death sentence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist you withyour repair efforts, would that give you time to retrieve your logs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's causing it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: These are the science stations. From the command centre here,we have control of the science stations <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and youknow, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn'twant me to reach out to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm trying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you doing, Will? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All hands, brace for impact! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you investigate the possibility of complyingwith Professor Moriarty's request. <eos> <bos> PICARD: An elm tree with a circular bench? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it worked. They believed they wereoff the holodeck. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Whalen. I bet he knows more about Dixon Hill than I do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were testing if you can replicate the vaccine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At the moment, it's you who are setting the tone. Thesophistication of this programming is remarkable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My name is Mot. I'm the barber. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we firstencountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will speak to the Ambassador about easing your restrictions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions, giveyou an idea of what he expected? <eos> <bos> PICARD: An excellent reason to escape. Do you think you've gained hisconfidence? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroy it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, will you join me in the Ready room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It takes very special people to live in such desolation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room. lock on to the landing party. Beam them up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, visual on K'Nera. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are no one's servant, Liko. I neither desire your obediencenor your worship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it's one programme among thousands. I just hope this forcefield has enough energy to trigger the pulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on the viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wishing for a thing does not make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To freedom. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the rightthing to do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, I have the distinct impression that we're beingtoyed with. Take us back to Rana Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, that won't be necessary, Mister Worf. I'm not here as yourcaptain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the HighCouncil. Your cha'DIch. We will arrive at your home world in less thana day. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You realise your career is finished. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He is different, yes. But that does not make him expendable, orany less significant. No being is so important that he can usurp therights of another. Now set him free! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much asurprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would haveliked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. Youlook a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like tomake one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. Ifshe had, I would have been part of your life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You found what you were looking for, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you have something to say, I'm listening. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you know it is now possible to predict the configuration ofa star system which won't be formed for another two million years? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and protecther. And we have to keep on working on the retrovirus. If we coulddistract him, if we could lure him away from her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo, Mister Worf. We'll haveto go after it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transportyourself aboard the Enterprise <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am not angry with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. I don't want to anthropomorphise anything. I seemsthat some creatures have the capacity to fill spaces you never knewwere empty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I feel I must postpone action until welearn more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall. Everything will be all right if you just keep climbing. What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing atschool? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Well, the first step is to find out why theEnterprise was transferring power to the Romulan ship. I think we should begin our search in the Romulan engine room. Counsellor, you spent several days on a Romulan vessel. You probablyknow more about the layouts than anyone here. Perhaps <eos> <bos> PICARD: And how shall you answer them tonight, Chancellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Rather like the ancient oral historians on Earth. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, of course. I entirely agree. Is it possible that suchconsuming dedication could interfere with her judgement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Laren, what's going on? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: A memento. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Goodnight. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It has declared a state of war and we are on the defensive. Wehave no control over our Medical Lab nor our computer. At this momentit has the power to destroy this ship and everybody on it. I need yourhelp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? What are you afraid of? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And Commander Riker is the only one who cantell us. Beam him directly here onto the Bridge <eos> <bos> PICARD: In spite of all you've done to me, I find you a pitiable man. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is Maques suggesting that your mother's metaconscious has beensomehow damaged? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And our memories of that day? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. This is for your benefit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can't correct it we may have to reverse course and leavethe nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. Do you think it's wise for you to go there alone? Afterall, they were expecting Baran to show up. Don't you think if I were to accompany you, it might seem moreplausible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wouldn't presume to speak for her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll be in my ready room. And Number One, good work. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And whatever happens down there, your prime responsibility isto the ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You said you'd reviewed her journals for the past five years. Maybe we should go further back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man. Temporarily. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion almostin our current course. There's a small object back there that wasn'tthere a few moments ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make no further attempts, Mister Worf. Any life form readingson the surface, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I trust the process we have built with the Romulans over thepast four years. They have nothing to gain by betrayal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If that's something you were going to test, <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matterfor the king that led them to it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through theregular transporting procedure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Mirandadecided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surpriseme. She was very independent, very strong willed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see I understand that you've been recommended for the Opsposition. Do you think you're up to it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We misinterpreted your actions as an attack on us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pagh, we're here to assist. Do youread me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. Establish parallel course. Match speed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want that four percent, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not her fault. These past few years have been verydifficult for her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're reading a disruption of the tachyon net in your area. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a few hours, I'll be turning him over to the Angosians, andI'll be happy to do it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to be here when he presents it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait! Hold your fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But we must have something in common. We communicate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I cannot permit that. The boy is my responsibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm willing to wager that you trounced your brothers duringthose debates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, we've done everything that we can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The support systems are being restored. We're continuingrepairs. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We have to assume they've also taken the Bridge. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've opened the hearing to spectators? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any waywe could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One. Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until theFerengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that hedeceived you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Continue on into close parking orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No theories, no half answers. Yes or no? <eos> <bos> PICARD: O brave new world, that has such people in it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you waken him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, end programme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A significant beginning. But first, I must ask that DoctorCrusher be allowed to see her son before we continue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You are dangerous. They're only victims. You made them whatthey are. You asked them to defend your way of life and then youdiscarded them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have an away team on board the ship. The initial reportindicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it wasfrom an attack. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, begin a phase one search, starting with theshuttlecraft's last known coordinates. Plot a proximity course towardthe star. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doesn't he deserve to become more than that? His true heritageis human, Endar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But the Prytt are not. They are reclusive to the point ofxenophobia. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is if you wish me to release him to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La ForgePICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging theFederation into a Klingon civil war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Let's go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My ship's company and I are certain of your gentle wisdom inthat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Like you. Different in appearance, yes. But we are both livingbeings. We are born, we grow, we live and we die. In all the ways thatmatter, we are alike. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ready to beam down to the vessel? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Patience is a human virtue, one which I am glad to see you'vetaken to heart. But doesn't this situation require a more Klingonresponse? Your discommendation is a facade to protect less honourablemen. It is a lie. Lies must be challenged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starbase Earhart. We came here right after graduation to awaitour first deep space assignments. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand ready at warp six, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief. I wanted to talk to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, that was too easy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man. The first thing it did was todestroy a space vessel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Coalition. Alliance. It all sounds so reasonable, but whatyou've described is the behaviour of urban street thugs. We certainlywon't trade weapons for crewmen. How do you suggest we deal with them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engine status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, it is a strength. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise to shuttle, please respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the matter with these people? How can he be Captain ofthat vessel and not understand its simplest function? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stay calm, everyone. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Astonishing. Commander Riker, have science lab three begin aseries of gamma emission tests. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status report, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about his skin colour? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But of course, as you and Lieutenant Riker have lived verydifferent lives for the past eight years, you are now very differentpeople. I suppose it's a little like meeting someone's twin. But nomatter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers onboard. And as Lieutenant Riker will be with us for several days, Ithink we should do everything we can to make him comfortable andwelcome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's true. But I have seen my share of death. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Pleaseproceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not in my power. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what's their offensive potential? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Other comments? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you counter the effect? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, release security forcefield eight B. Hello, Jeremy. Howare you? Are you frightened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And so the earlier probe was responsible for the Yamato'sdestruction? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, I know that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am only here to secure the release of the Federationhostages. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When can you correct the problem? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. How is he? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Security to deck six, section twenty five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes! Right. That's it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's all right, Madeline, I'll take it in here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, take them to level five. Disarm them. Hold themfor questioning. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's interesting that you should mention the Horatio. It's oneof the subjects I wanted to discuss. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please, Mister Worf, come in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tallera, I've decided on a change of plan. Take one of theartefacts with you. Leave the other here. As soon as we have ourpayment in full, we'll complete the delivery. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wait. You can. I'll let you. But first, tell me. What is, whatwas your other choice? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create alifeform? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, the colonists are not going to be happy about that. Someof them have been there for decades. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are they willing to leave? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's just get that uncaught, shall we? There's everyindication he's served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratingsaboard the Zhukov were satisfactory. In fact I recall Captain Gleasonspeaking quite highly of him before his transfer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It goes deeper than that. A fine war mare would sleep in abedouin's tent, carry him into battle, feed his children with her milk. There's a bond which is created by mutual need. Hello, beautiful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that's what Troi asked me to do. But why? Ten Forward, ifyou could be more specific about our intended destination <eos> <bos> PICARD: The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Engineering. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want continuous subspace sweeps. We maybe able to detect a temporal disturbance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise encountered a probe that had been sent from theplanet before it was destroyed. It had scanned me and I lostconsciousness, and in the space of twenty five minutes I lived alifetime on that planet. I had a wife, and children, and a grandchild. And it was absolutely real to me. When I awoke, all that I had left ofthat life there was the flute that I had taught myself to play. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think that you should enjoy the hospitality of the ship. Mister Data here will see to your every comfort. If you will excuse me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Could this planet have escaped that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I care about, I care about what happens on board my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you fromtaking that action, Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There is a treaty between our peoples. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Leijten, you said that before Brevelle desertedStarbase one one two last week, he'd been ill for several days. Whatabout Mendez? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm beaming you up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard, of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Which means, of course <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're excused, crewman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I gather you were unsuccessful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, soon she'll be ship-shape and Bristol-fashion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If it is a design flaw, we're better to stay where we are andgive Geordi time to work on it. Or what happened to the Yamato couldhappen to us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think the chances of that is remote. And if you will bestill, Mister Elbrun, you may learn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker, we're ready. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How do we reason with them? Let them know that we are not athreat? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cause? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please, come in. I'm delighted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. And at this moment, I really have no idea whynot. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Discussion is irrelevant. There are no terms. You will disarm all your weapons and escort us to Sector zero zero onewhere we will begin assimilating your culture and technology. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. You knew this would happen, didn't you? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You may call me whatever you wish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Endar's entire claim on Jono is based on Talarian custom he'dhave a hard time backing away from it now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. Yousimply cannot let this civilisation die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I realise how unusual this must seem. My appearance is theresult of an accident, involving myself and three other crew members,the effects of which Doctor Crusher is currently working to remedy. Iassure you I am Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is Data now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is exactly as they left it, Number One. In the bottle. Theship in the bottle. Good Lord, didn't anybody here build ships inbottles when they were boys? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cortan? Cortan Zweller? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Graves, every man has his time. Every man, without exception. But you've cheated. You have extended your life at the expense ofanother. Graves, give Data back. Give him back. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good for you, Uncle. You know what? I once wrote a report aboutstarships when I was about your age. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How many devices do we think we're dealingwith, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As soon as the Ambassador transports over from the Decius. Wewill get through this, as we have many times before. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain, perhaps it would be best if we discussed this <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does this have something to do with the Klingons you rescuedfrom Carraya Four? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What, what's that? What's that, Wesley? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And is it the same situation if it's an epidemic, and not ageological calamity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cease fire. Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'll be irrational. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Excuse me. What can I do for you, MisterBender? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But thenthere must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One moment. Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf, you know what to do. Take us er <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, I cannot believe that you are notwilling to stay here until we <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope he will tell us soon. IAN <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase power to forward shields. Hail them again, MisterWorf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not smugness, not arrogance. But we are resolute, we aredetermined, and your help is not required. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: With the contamination? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's going to lose. The Nausicaan is cheating. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I saw no need. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I ask you a frank question? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tayna, exactly is Apgar doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I'm fine. Really, Marta, I'm fine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, where are you taking him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Whenever I look at you now, I won't see a powerful Cardassianwarrior. I will see a six year old boy who is powerless to protecthimself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, butwe could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good luck, Number One. Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Liko. Liko, I am a man. I am not the Overseer. I am atraveller from a faraway land. Nothing more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, is the wave affecting our warp drive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to DoctorCrusher's office. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power ofthought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound there was noway to stop it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because there is something else you can learn. With an alertcrew, even our primitive vocal communications are unnecessary. With asingle look I was able to inform my crew that I wanted to hold youhere. 4 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Pull any personnel you can use. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by hisson. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill myson. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one pointin space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freighter, we're going to lock on the tractor beam and pull youout of orbit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, it could be nothing more than the result of a sleeplessnight. But let's be sure. Have Data and Geordi run a shipwidediagnostic, concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices,and we'll discuss the results tomorrow at seven hundred hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think so, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But not his mother. Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My hand. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Begin countdown. Mark. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Advise them of our status, Mister Worf. Go. Replicate what youneed, and see that the devices are properly distributed. Not forgetting Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that certainsacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfatherunderstood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you man your station. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. That's very, very commendable. And you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over asCommandant, Starfleet Academy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit withus here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree to your terms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's quite difficult. The anguish of the man, the despairpouring out of him, all those feelings, the regrets. I can't stop them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tau Ceti Three. It was a bar. Quite an exotic one as Iremember. What do I win? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid we're going to have to evacuate your people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A possibility. Captain's log, Stardate 43463.7. We're holding aposition at the Neutral Zone border proximate to Nelvana Three. If ourguest is telling the truth, there are twenty one hours left before theRomulan base becomes functional. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Curious? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I do not see what I can do to assist. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the planet surface? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So you're taking on Riker this time. Excellent. He'll defeatyou just as I did. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I can understand them looking at a dying man's eyes, but thehowling? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How! How do I do it? How do I destroy everything? The controlroom, the probes, all of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You had no right to involve me without my permission. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I will not step outside the traditional role of the Arbiter. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any treatment you can give him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extend shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Traveller? What is your destination? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Chief O'Brien. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your offer, Lieutenant, but this is myresponsibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Things would be different. 8.27 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you bring her back? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, that is a fine argument, but it doesn't change myfeeling that the proper place for Lal to develop is by Data's side. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Prepare a class one sensor probe. We'll leave itbehind to monitor the final closure. Mister Crusher, lay in a coursefor Archer Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's good. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation, of a Federation starship. Standby to receive emergencyteams. Commander, we will handle this one step at a time. Stabilisetheir power systems and tend to their injured, and avoid alldiscussions of where and when they are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no. That's not it. I want you to identify something forme, if you can. Captain to Transporter Room. Three to beam up. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was just trying to rescue you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. But there is too much history between the Durasand the Romulans to discount the possibility. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Mister Data. I need you on the Bridge with me. There ismuch to be done. We have less than forty eight hours to prevent a war. Or perhaps to start one. This will depend on establishing the truth of <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where is she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A strategy, with fist open. With fist open. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All stop. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll have to fill in, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, but I should prepare for the ceremony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will not survive ours. Shall we die together? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: For me as well, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One. Happy birthday. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard'sinterlink system. I think that it uses some kind of phased-pulsetechnology. Do you think it could be modified to generate a kedionpulse that would reboot Data'sprogramme? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Data, I can see it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can preventthe deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,that all this is just a delusion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who's manning the command post? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that's a big advantage on this mission. Very well. MisterData, will you contact Holza, arrange a meeting? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On the contrary, I have no wish to discuss issues of propertyor of territory, when our mutual problem remains. Like it or not, weare both trapped by this energy draining forcefield from the planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We agreed you would never trouble my ship again! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you care to comment privately how youread any of this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Like it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are a great deal of fluctuations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I can't discuss it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Commander Riker, will you see to the Admiral'sstaff? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tuppence. Two pence. Supposed to be good luck. We may needsome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When you say it wants you, do you mean it'sstill you, only you, and not me. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: All of this is true, but there is an old horse trainer's adageabout putting too much weight on a young back. We don't want him tobreak under pressure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I asked you, what is this place? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, Irealised that I didn't have those feelings any more. Twenty years is,after all, a long time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want todisrupt your recreation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thee and me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. TheEnterprise will be leaving this sector immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You cannot put a price on a life. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I imagine you know why I've asked you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Mister Worf, these are not jat'yIn. Our job is tofind out exactly what they are and then to determine how to deal withthem. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Filling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlockbut that can only be performed in a maintenance bay. Is there any otherreason for opening the valve? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, be sure we get tricorder images of their tacticaldisplay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Was Commander La Forge able to provide you with the specialcargo handling provisions you requested? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The centre of the galaxy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What about the entity that controlled you, What were yourperceptions of him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: mev yap! Sit down. We will begin the ja'chuq. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thanks to the two of you, the way has been paved for furtherrescue operations. N'Vek's efforts, and his sacrifice, were not in vain. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

What people? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's come up with something that may give us a chance, if weagree to stay out of it. He proposes to turn total control of the shipover to the computer because it is capable of making quickeradjustments than any human being. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Assemble a minimal away team. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes. She seems a very sturdy craft. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let him go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, neither have I. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, what can you tell us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are we doing transporting Romulans on board the ship inthe middle of a battle? They don't have any weapons and that one looksinjured. If they were part of an invasion, then why are they unarmed? It doesn't make any sense. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see your point. My apologies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In what way have we mistreated her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beam up the away team immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep me advised, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Anaya, full about. Half impulse. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And here, here, where the energy is lowest? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No apologies are necessary. You reminded us that there areobligations that go beyond duty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find outwhat's going on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, perhaps you'd better go along as well. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hey, why don't you spend more time with that young fellowDannick? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing toentertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans. But what would the Romulans want with you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Leave us! We've passed your little test. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of here. The Romulan ship is set to auto-destructand they can't deactivate it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freeze. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Incidental? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We still have no idea what you represent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, would it possible to saturate the asteroid withverteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and preventthe Romulans from detecting it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sub-warp? It's several hours away then? Let's take a look atit. Enlarge to maximum. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you not see an inherent conflict of interest here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: For how long? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I entirely agree with you, Number One. It's not the time. But the time may come when we will be required to take greater risks. Iwant you to consider her plan as a fall back position. Make thenecessary preparations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Torture has never been a reliable means of extractinginformation. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. Onewonders that it's still practiced. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, bring the Admiral up here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree. <eos> <bos> PICARD: My ankle is broken. I will just slow you down when you need tomove quickly. Now, you are the leader. And that's an order. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, come on, it's been hours. You must be hungry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain that. What the hell happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The matter is already decided. You're beaming down to yourworld with the felicium. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Speed, warp seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I won't die? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then your friend is in trouble. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your returnfrom the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's the act of a Starfleet officer obeying his Captain, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would seem that Baran has to deliver these artefacts to theassassin in order to get paid. Therefore, you and I should continue ourmasquerade. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Until tonight, Lutan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? Myown father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend thevineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we couldcome to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. Idon't want the same thing to happen to you and me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure you have done a complete investigation, and if youwish to continue it, of course you have my support. But we shall bereaching the Beta Agni system shortly, and I expect you to be rested. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps I just needed a shoulder. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can no longer afford to be patient. Unless we act soon,Esoqq will starve. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck seven. Picard to Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec'sship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I hope this will be brief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, is there any way that the Enterprise couldcoax that satellite <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare for saucer separation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, begin a scan of the interior surfacefor life forms. I want to know who brought us in here and why. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, report to the main Bridge immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How was the Bat'leth tournament? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what are you here to do? Ask for a refund? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What does this mean? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can I do? <eos> <bos> PICARD: But it's not conclusive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In fact, the Admiral is fact suggesting you be moved to GalorFour, Lal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much hytritium did we manage to bring on board? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you mind telling me what has happened? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing more? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Has the ambassador been delayed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And some would say they must be getting help. The Romulans areprepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over theFederation. Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of theKlingon Empire in the balance, they are content to stand by and watch? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Margaret, something's very wrong here. Do you know what's goingon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hail the colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am prepared to offer an added incentive. If you win, I'lltake you to the ruins of Ligillium. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For me, too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By the way, where is our new doctor? Has she reported in? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm curious, Mister Data. Why are you looking at all theseother cultures? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, how do we get out? Mister Data, could youreconfigure the sensors to detect these anomalies? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Boothby, tell me some more about Nova Squadron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Whalen's life. You must help us to save him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. Data, I have todestroy this. This control room and its technology must not be allowedto fall into Romulan hands. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengitransmissions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What would you have me do? March down there and destroy theman? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Please get to the point. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, right now we have more immediate concerns. Does your mapshow us a way out of here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Ensign, that's enough. Captain Dirgo, you're an ablepilot. I welcome your input. Do you feel that there is an alternativewe're overlooking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Governor Vagh, thank you for coming. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you would rather stay and find out what it is? What is itsintent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need toneutralise the homing signal <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me explain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on, Beverly, we've got to get out of here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goeswrong in the discussion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, let's have a look. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. What is yoursituation? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why can't you get out? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please do. And Number One? Everything about this seems wrong. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Remembrance and regrets, they too are a part of friendship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exit! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief, transport them to the planet surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, determine what these people may have in the way ofemergency needs and provide for them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to bridge. Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go on with your report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Geordi, I'd like you to talk to Counsellor Troi. She'sexpecting you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it closed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd like that very much. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, see if you can move us away from thedisturbance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm bringing the runabout in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. It's several kilometres to find another way around thatridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's aforcefield protecting it, but we can find some way to deal with thatwhen we get there. Come on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: The strategic decision is to send one ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They want to go home. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What could they possibly be doing down there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data knows precisely what he is doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Try to get more power to the field coils. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could believe you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One, did something unusual just occur on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct MisterWorf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: None that I know of, but I'll check with the Bajoran liaisonOffice. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. Mister La Forge, are you ready to separate our guestfrom the hull? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We don't even know if this catastrophe is preventable. Call aconference in my quarters. All senior staff. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sidney. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can two grown men share the same childhood experiences? Itjust doesn't make any sense. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: I remember. I was so nervous I was afraid that I would dropher. Now look at the little lady. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, on the contrary, Professor, you were quite helpful. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, but I was going to. I would have told him anything. Anything at all. But more than that, I believed that I could see fivelights. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

This delay had better prove out, LaForge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are prepared to transport you fromthe surface whether you come willingly or not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Er, er. It's not over between us, Lwaxana. You're mine and Iwill not let you go. I insist you return to my side immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, report to detention cell three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, locate Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Manual override on shields. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be. Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with theselife forms. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's your other option? P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuitytransmitter? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What I would like is to be returned to my ship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well done. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see you keep up with our duty roster. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, then we have no other choice. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the last thing you do remember? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But that's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're quite a distance from either of theirterritories. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By all means check the trace log. But even if the results arenegative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But you didn't. And that's human. We make mistakes. Geneticmanipulation or not, nobody's perfect. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Life form readings? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, you must have been playing since you were young. Iplayed the piano for a while when I was small, but I didn't put in thepractice you must have. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Please. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Now to activate it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief Investigator, welcome to theEnterprise. I'm Captain Picard. This is my First Officer, CommanderWilliam Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by to increase speed to warp seven point three. On mymark. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps we do. The Vorgons are time travellers. Now that theyknow where and when the Uthat can be found, they may very well comeback and try for it again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using thenatural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll inform her. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, MisterData. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's very kind. Qapla'! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Barron, I cannot, I will not, impose a set ofcommandments on these people. To do so violates the very essence of thePrime Directive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do you see me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm so sorry. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you step into my Ready room, please. And bring atricorder with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm not certain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I think it is reasonable to take precautions. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How is she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I advise you to listen closely for I will not say this again. Icame to Risa for a holiday, nothing more. I have no knowledge of thiswoman of whom you speak, nor have I laid eyes on any disc. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There isn't a piano. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take partin that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich culturalheritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you identify the origin of the infection, Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. I look forward to your report, Mister Broccoli. Barclay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep an eye on it. Mister Worf, any luck? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I came to you. You're the officer for this sector. Ihad no choice but to come to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now we now have a reasonable hypothesis asto whom. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you all right? Go. Return to your own time. There's nothing for you here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myselfhere. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that youhaven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist calledFreeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow spherecould be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage ofharnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living onthe interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources ofpower. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps Captain Scott could be of use in accessing thatmaterial. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, yes, of course, if all parties request it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Activate a deflector dish. If we project a particle beam, wemay be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect within the core. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then the only alternative would be a stalemate. Maybe acompromise might have been reached, a compromise that forced Data intothis silence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, they could fire until their lasers ran dry and theywouldn't hurt the Enterprise. My predicament is what to do with you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, very well. I will monitor your progress from here. Butjust remember, ten minutes, no more. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign! Return fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A simple handshake would have sufficed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us in. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indulge me, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will it survive? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Me? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominentlydisplayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others. <eos> <bos> PICARD: One's available? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sleep, Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Valedictorian? Arms raised in victory? Were you so jealous? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be allright <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine. You want to be treated as a human? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-Cwill fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,hopefully, will continue for a long while. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We can't just stay here while our ship is beingcommandeered. JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: How much time? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed anylonger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the away team? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And so there is no evidence that a weapon was used? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Visions? Do you mean dreams? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Grand. Commence operations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is not a crime, Worf. Nor can we infer his guilt becausehe didn't respond. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Romulans have always wanted to destroy the alliance betweenthe Federation and the Klingons. If Mister La Forge had killed you,Governor, I think you would agree, they might have succeeded. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Worf. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm beginning to realise that you seem to always have someacerbic remark on the tip of your tongue. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sorry, I can't tell you that yet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, the important thing during any confinement is to thinkpositively and not give up hope. There is a way out of every box, thereis a solution to every puzzle. It's just a matter of finding it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're wonderful. And am I that transparent? <eos> <bos> PICARD: A simple yes would have sufficed, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must speak to you about your son. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do youreveal yourselves to us now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there is something else, any further courtesy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff Officer, Radue. StarfleetRegulation six point five seven requires that at least two StaffOfficers are present during any treaty or contract negotiations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf acknowledge. Can you hear me, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, get us out of here. Warp nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasmaconduits. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You understand your orders? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Terminate communications. Come with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, we would appear magical to Stone Age people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge, Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Walter Horne? Is he still teaching? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maques, what were you doing in Sickbay? <eos> <bos> PICARD: In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to theirquarters, as a precautionary measure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I'm just trying to be as dull aspossible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What shall we play? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sit down! Please. Please. Now, we're here to talk. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That is beyond my purview. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are we ready, Commander La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: My point exactly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Location, Paris, Cafe des Artistes, as it appeared twenty twoyears ago. April the ninth, fifteen hundred hours, three o'clock. Warmspring day. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Just have Mister Data fetch me in a shuttle. And have him bringalong a uniform. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Easy, we don't want to alarm or provoke it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll respect your wishes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Return to the ship immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare to transport these prisoners back down tothe moon's surface. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain theseincredible explosions of velocity? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Exactly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since acaptain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what Iproject. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wonder what they talked about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your support is appreciated, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig mainphaser banks to deliver an energy beam. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Screen off. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, they are not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can have full use ofthe ship's computer to set up a comm. link and upload your data fromhere. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Forgive me, Admiral, I thought you were sent here to form anopinion, not to justify one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then it's time for me to go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's head for the closer one. <eos> <bos> PICARD: While you're at it, run a localised subspace scan to look foranything unusual. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very impressive. There's something you should know. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Give me a chance to put things back the way they were before. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assume that you're referring to Kahless. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tell me about him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Darwin Station, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed. Human or not, I want no part of you. We will deposityou at the first starbase. Let them deal with you. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you smell a change? What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted fromJameson isn't possible any more. And you wanted revenge. You blamedyour war on him, and there's no doubt he had a lot to do with it. Butyou had the weapons and you used them. You could have tried fornegotiations for peace on your planet long ago. Instead you chose tofight. How many of those forty years of civil war are on your head,Karnas? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would you come here. There's something I want to show you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, and Wesley may have given us a few seconds, too. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Roots? What, these? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must know we will not allow you to dothis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enjoy yourself. You have the free time. Use it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Will. I never made that log entry, of course, but itstill leaves you with a duty to perform. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Our destiny is elsewhere. But I'm happy that yours is here withus, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter room three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get him out of there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed? Surprised he's not busy gloating over his victory. <eos> <bos> PICARD: By whose calculations? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What exactly will this work entail? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now there's a name we haven't heard for a while. <eos> <bos> PICARD: When the Yamato was probed, where was she? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking upfrom a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of theEnterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then itall changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in thefuture, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't rememberwhat it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nor do I. I don't even remember who I am. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Full cooperation, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints andspecifications, but this will be my first time aboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Gates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Aaron! <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, it is not. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you locate them? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seventeen degrees to port, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report! <eos> <bos> PICARD: When she left to become head of StarfleetMedical. But going from one assignment to another is part of the lifewhich you are choosing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of course. These are frightening things that are happening. Butwe won't let anyone harm you. Counsellor, why don't you take the boy tomy quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Run a localised subspace scan to look for anything else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involvedin the negotiations as your representative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked meto leave the Enterprise, to join him in an archaeological expeditionwhich could last for nearly a year. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I suggest that youshould prepare for bed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As you were. Mister Data, will you join mein my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine ifit's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. MisterData, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federationrecords. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaulabout fifty years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm pleased you agreed to meet with us, Mister Keeve. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroy the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The experiment achieved a stable coretemperature for a short time, Minister. That's a significant stepforward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any changes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: May I sleep on it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, there's no time for that! Starfleet will be here anyminute. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Set coordinates for main Bridge. Portforward for me and aft for you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Processing centre? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Med Alert. Medical emergency. Doctor Crusher to the observationlounge at once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A few hours. If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact youimmediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge has a thought. He believes we can phaser aslice in the field <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: 'Audet Nine, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he doesn't help us, we'll have to destroy the outpost andkill everyone on it. He's still a Starfleet officer. He won't want totake innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do as Data says. At once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any indications of weapons or vesselsbeneath the surface? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fine, but don't leave her unattended. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops positionthere <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would be risky to set a trap here, so close to Federationspace. But the fact remains, here we are, there is no freighter. Didyour contact tell you anything else that might be helpful? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirtyfour, thirty five, and thirty six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Q, I'm not your father confessor. You will receive noabsolution from me. You have brought nothing but pain and suffering tothis crew. And I'm still not entirely convinced that all this isn'tyour latest attempt at a puerile joke. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You believe it's a design flaw? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me talk to him. Number One, I think we have an opportunityto end this siege. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm sure. Will he leave when he sees there's no other choice? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Proceed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, is this yours? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll have the transporter room standingby. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready ornot. Please keep Mister Worf apprised. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will your nervous system be able to handle that much sensoryinput? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, thenperhaps he could force Masaka to leave. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I appreciate your concern, Commander Data. What can I do foryou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, listen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, Mister Worf! Now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've shut off the tachyon pulses in theother time periods but it hasn't changed theanomaly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your strategy failed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would theyhave kept it thatsimple? Try it. Picard out. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish I could say I did. Increase magnification by ten. By onehundred. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Still no visual contact. That's impossible. Mister Worf, same magnification fifty degrees starboard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, run a full systems diagnostic. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know that! <eos> <bos> PICARD: That pleases me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain an open channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: They're taking all the adults down to the surface. It lookslike they're keeping all the children on board the ship. Where was yourdaughter? JR <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, my dear Louis, two men. Robert's and my father's. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's going on, Q? What's your real purpose here? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: You could always resign your commission. Stay here with me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, where are the Romulans? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Move to intercept. <eos> <bos> PICARD: For these negotiations to succeed I must be a mediator, not anenforcer. You have the Bridge, Number One. Brull. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then you have the advantage. Is this Bok? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I have encountered many who more credibly could be called thedevil than you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This would seem that this is Masaka'stemple. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's try turning up the volume. Increase the intensity, MisterData. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge is my Chief Engineer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is becoming very tiresome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If there is to be a lasting peace, Gul Macet, neither you nor Imust allow any one man to undermine our efforts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, they are currently in their hibernation cycle,However, they will awaken in six months, at which time we can get thismatter settled. Now, do you want to wait or give me my three weeks? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Source? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. We are very pleased with the operation of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Wouldn't that be a little obvious, Admiral? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believeyou? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, all senior officers report to the Bridge. On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open frequencies. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then the Sheliak must agree to extend our deadline. They planto settle Tau Cygna Five two days from now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because they needed a liaison to communicate with humans. Theyignored every away team we sent to their ship, including yours, Doctor. You may accompany him. Goodbye. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. Tasha? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your reportas almost magical attempts to please us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All of it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask forhelp? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before theconference begins. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we just get this over with. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unacceptable! <eos> <bos> PICARD: However intriguing that may be, we are now in the midst of anurgent journey. Once that is completed, then, perhaps Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, I'll sleep here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Malencon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. Ifit's not a disease, what else could have made them do that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander La Forge, Mister Worf, come with me. Number One, youhave the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section athigh warp velocity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I couldn't find your medical kit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Riker will join you in a moment. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Expect a medical team to accompany me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, Q, I thought you told me that I was dead. Now it seems thatI'm alive. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which isslowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm toldthat in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge! Mister La Forge, are you all right? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I am trying to get things off on a better note this time. I want to make her feel at ease. I want her to feel that she's welcomeaboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go to Red alert. Sound general quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Disengage all engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the threetime periods is what is causing the anomaly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Later. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What can we do to prevent this from happening again? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep a close watch on it. So close to the Neutral Zone it can'tbe random. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. Please report to my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is the Captain speaking. Alldecks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attemptto warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre yourthoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called theTraveller. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a strange sensation. Suddenly having these thoughtsappear in my mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't touch him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then take us out of orbit, Number One. Set a course forRachelis, warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's true, and he will stand for his crimes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take over, Commander Data, I'll be in observation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I remember my biology, there are several natural immunesystems that come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetusfrom viral infections. <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you had any success, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Where we are, where we were, and where we will be. Data, I wantthis to be an away team of one. You. I don't think there's any reasonto risk anyone else. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have no choice. Prepare to receive us. We're beaming onboard. Picard out. Cancel Red Alert. Tell Sovereign Marouk meet me intransporter three. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you certain, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've been away far too long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? What can I do for you, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, no. We cannot allow ourselves think that. The SeventhGuarantee is one of the most important rights granted by theFederation. We cannot take a fundamental principle of the Constitutionand turn it against a citizen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, the end is closer than you like to think. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I'm pickingup three proximity sensors around it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want thembefore we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you tohelp the Emissary. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge thispower cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energyrelays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one morecharge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate theshuttlecraft's engines. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'd be happy to. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Data, this is Chief Investigator Krag. Commander, bytaking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by theInvestigator, would it be possible to programme the Holodeck torecreate what happened on the science station? <eos> <bos> PICARD: As a matter of fact <eos> <bos> PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Check with Mister La Forge. See ifhe found anything in the matter sample from the nebula. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Mister Singh? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It must have been lying in some deep moon crater. First attackdamaged the shields. In the confusion, they hit us a second time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire! <eos> <bos> PICARD: And that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, we're approaching the Idini StarCluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enough. Let's talk to Riva. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then he will die. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With respect, Admiral, I would point out no one else has heardor considered Karnas's demands. The Federation might view themdifferently if they knew what they were. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Gentlemen. The question is, who? I can't believe it's one ofour people. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transport. This may be a littletricky. I would like you to handle it. LAFORGE <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak withhim. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we transport through the interference? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Adjust course to intercept. Warp seven. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us out of warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Agreed. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, putting that on one side for the moment, let's assumethat by some unexplained phenomenon, you witnessed an event thatoccurred to Lieutenant Kwan. Those faces that you saw. Did yourecognise any of them? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. We accept your gracious offer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destination? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, you said that this was formed from the organic matterfound in thedeck plates. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up theaway team immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: In this case, I think I do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery. Louismentioned the Atlantis project needed a director, and I found myselfactually thinking about it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, please, Counsellor, I would very much like to hear yourthoughts. First of all, and I would like you to be absolutelystraightforward with me. How would you evaluate me as an officer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: See if the corridor is empty. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Will you meet Commander Data on the Bridge. He has our ordersand new heading. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannotblindly follow orders. You acknowledge their sentience, but you ignoretheir personal liberties and freedom. Order a man to hand his childover to the state? Not while I am his captain. If you wish, you canaccompany us to Starfleet, where we shall see <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay <eos> <bos> PICARD: That thought had passed through my mind, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm inclined to agree. I don't think that forty eight hours istoo much time to risk particularly when the gains areso substantial. You may proceed, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago,Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're the loneliest person in the world right now. No one cansay anything, no one can do anything that will help. And you think thatit will never go away. And you're right, it won't. But you can get usedto it. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but you can. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does whilehe's asleep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps it would be prudent to find out if he'd acquired anyenemies there. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, tell me a little about yourself, Crewman. I know you wereborn on Mars Colony. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Clearly this was much more than an empathic echo. It seems thatyou were actually seeing something that happened in the control roomeight years ago. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's it. The way into our world. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring the ship about. Let's take alook at Mister Worf's distortion. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse. If I can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency,I should be able to take it out with one shot. Firing. Their shieldsare down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Use caution, but protect Graves' health <eos> <bos> PICARD: I just purchased that. Why? Are you implying this has somespecial meaning? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, shall we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? TransporterChief! Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long do we have shields based on current calculations? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, can you access it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Moriarty, you were conjured up to attemptto defeat Holmes here. Once that attempt is concluded, win or lose,yourprogramme has run its course. Your existence is done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Furthermore, pursuant to subsection D three, I name theGrisellas to arbitrate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Time? <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, how old are you, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Translation? From whom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want you both to becompletely familiar with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, tell me if. It's good to see you again. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I know you will, Captain. Lieutenant Yar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tholl, our captors have transporters, they have stun beams. Itis hardly likely that they would try to hold us at bay with a knife. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What have they done to my ship now? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: May we turn on the viewer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

But it allseems so vague. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time, andstill be back in time for the rendezvous. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Left by whom? There are no indications of life on this planet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can we go to warp? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happened to her? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say,you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not surprising. Altarian viruses can be a nastybusiness. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I want to be returned to my ship immediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Of what? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If I were, would you give it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Granted. Will you escort him to the Bridge, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So, you're Ronin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where are youfrom? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, there's a reference in Captain Varley's personallog to a probe that scanned the Yamato. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. We'll give you cover. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is this place, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you can help me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know better than to try and movetrilithium resin. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your mind isdifferent, it's not the same as <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sit down. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That energy cloud, Commander. I believe it important we haveanother look at it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There are other Bajorans in Starfleet. Assign one of them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Increase speed to warp eight point nine. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And even to reverse death itself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That being first, at any cost, is not always the point. MisterData, while we await repairs, I want Life Sciences and Engineering tocontinue collecting information on the alien. And query the Vega Nineprobe, long range sensors. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, our sensors have been rendered ineffective by thefield distortion. I want your analysis. Mister Worf, fire phasers,maximum intensity, limited spectrum. Zero zero one mark zero four five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Jeremy, I have some bad news. There hasbeen an accident. Your mother has died. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't you mention this earlier? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Indeed we do. Mister Data, set course for the Neutral Zone. Warp six. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A little premature, aren't we? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Magnify. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then anyefforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to workthis out for himself. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status report, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why not? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here he comes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We're not certain. It may be that there is some unusual effectproduced by the Ullians' telepathic activity. I'm going to talk tothem, and in the meantime, you're to stay here and recuperate. And ifyou remember anything at all about what happened, I want you to tell meimmediately. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Normally, I would be the first one to agree, but perhaps somethings best left in the past. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Permission granted. Mister Burke, will you handle that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've just been paid a visit from Q. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oui, au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens. The spirit of thatcity can always enchant my soul. <eos> <bos> PICARD: As are we, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let's investigate. Maintain speed. Alter course accordingly. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, turn off that noise! Computer, what was that? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, send out a series of class-four probes to surveythe far side of the sphere. Perhaps we'll have more luck with them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But if it doesn't work, we won't have another chance for eightyears. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what this is all about. A lot has changed in the pastthree hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with theaccumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need forpossessions. We have grown out of our infancy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On what grounds? <eos> <bos> PICARD: DaiMon, clearly there has been some misunderstanding. I thinkit would be in all interests if you were to come aboard and we discussthis situation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If he can put an end to all the years ofblood-letting on those planets, I think we should do everything in ourpower to assist him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerableamount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that yousimply imagined <eos> <bos> PICARD: A message? Very well. Tell Gowron, leader of the High Councilof the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard,needs a favour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At home. Sunday dinner. We would all sing afterward. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Find him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So do I, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 45021.3. ConvincingStarfleet Command to establish a blockade was relatively painless. Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long can you maintain it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkwardtransition. You're the next likely choice. And Mister Mendozawill certainly agree. He's quite impressed by your natural instincts. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's clear that he's frightened, but that's hardly anindication <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's quite all right. It must be important, or you wouldn't behere. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you and Voval working together? He's the only one who couldhave brought you the necklace. <eos> <bos> PICARD: These are Commander Troi's quarters. Can you tell if she'sinside? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: GeordiPICARD <eos> <bos> PICARD: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against hislife. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here becauseyou're in danger. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Understood. Ensign, set a course. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The lights stay on. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And quite adamant. Mister Okona, what crimes are you accusedof? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How about a sandwich? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hello, D'Tan. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your word has always been good enough for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How can we help? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red Alert. All hands stand to battle stations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There doesn't seem to be a way around. We'll have to rappelfrom here. This is sheer granite. We'll have to use fusing pitons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I've had enough of being led about this way. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long will it be? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Weapons report, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is the boy doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would it be simpler if I were not your commanding officer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor, as this is a female dominated society, you mightwish to make the initial contact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What could motivate someone like your father to commit such anact? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How bad is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl <eos> <bos> PICARD: Re-engage now. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Fire torpedoes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold this position. Hailing frequencies. Calling the Pagh. Thisis the Enterprise. We are here to assist. Do not fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But what if it isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take thatchance? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Did you sense something from any of us at that time? Anyunusual emotion? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. Ithink it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that willall change once I'm back on board. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassianpresence here for another six weeks. Your arrival here may have upsetsome very delicate negotiations. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's going on? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maintain Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: And this is the only way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have been in contact with Admiral Kennelly during thismission? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: The same conditions won't permit a shuttleto land safely, Mister LaForge. Any suggestions? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans brought in. No, wait, Idon't want them to have access to the Bridge. We will contact you in afew minutes. I will continue this in the guestquarters. Commander, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: So I ask you again, why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I ordered you to lie? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Theorise, Mister Data. What would be the purpose of such anencasement? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What do you want of us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sneezing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. It was thoughtful of you to inviteLwaxana Troi to be part of the Betazed delegation. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you for the confirmation, Doctor. But now, except forRiker, I would like you all to return to your stations. Is that clear? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Before you wake them up, I want to have Security here. Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You asked for me. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not as much as you'd imagine. Sarek and Spock. Well, sometimes,fathers and sons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. And put out a hazard advisory to Starfleet. Ensign,set a course to Evadne Four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a continuous sensor sweep. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Deanna, your mother might still come out of this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Cold. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, manoeuvre us into tractor beamrange. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What did you say? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are the Ornarans recovering? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious oldman. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good. Excellent. Fourteen hundred hours, then. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your advice, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do themodifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory asto what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I won't keep you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anything, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's the launch sequence? How do I override the doors? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? Because it offends against our sensibilities? It is notour mission to impose Federation or Earth values on any others in thegalaxy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes? Who the hell is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, there some words I've known since I was a school boy. With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured,the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us allirrevocably. Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdomand warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're alldamaged. I fear that today <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let us negotiate in good faith. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge, my reputation as a litigator, not to mentionmy immortal soul, is in serious jeopardy. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I regret a great many things from those days. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep trying. Counsellor, you'll have to gather the parents. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why didn't we detect it before? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starfleet has sent a message asking us to proceed to the Phelansystem to negotiate a trade agreement. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's happening again. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: May we arrange for your transport? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then he has? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is speaking? <eos> <bos> PICARD: All right. Why did I invite you here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It still makes it our move. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To protect you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What was Malencon doing when he was killed? <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question is, how are we going to deal with it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Radue, this is Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that so? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't you tell me what to do! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Perhaps you've got some sort of fast growth strain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Be ready to stop the power transfer, MisterData. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago andwhatever's going on now? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: We'll stay and investigate. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Get rid of that damned twitch and put on the correct uniform. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was there I saw the tears. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I look forward to your reports. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I don't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell are you doing here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paidmy respects. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I should think the shifting passions of this beast would be farmore terrifying. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'll fill you in later. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't think that has anything to do with anything. Well,perhaps it was because. This is foolish. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you analysed the risk factor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And for all your protestations of friendship, your real reasonfor being here is protection. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Seven years! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who is this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nothing. Well, almost nothing in my position of ship's Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Phasers and sensors both useless? Mister Data, this reflectionphenomenon, would it have the same effect on a disruptor-style weapon? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will proceed with the probe. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There will be no interference from us, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How about Jean-Luc? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If your theory is accurate, Doctor, what would happen if wewere to inflict pain on the others? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Keep monitoring their approach. Repeat the hail every half anhour. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Dojhon. Doj hon. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He said that he had nowhere to go. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I'm Captain Picard, commanding this Federation starship. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, what is your analysis? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anna! Anna! <eos> <bos> PICARD: I notice you haven't taken off your gloves. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're going to need them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, now that Wesley's safe, go to Sickbay at once. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Hold your position until the Rutianmedics arrive. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We will end this war, if you will end the war. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Put it on main viewer. Identification? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, display interior security grid. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You're killing him. He won't survive another session. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very good. Data, I have an assignment for you. One especiallysuited to your talents. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, bring us to bearing oh three oh mark five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, but the battle was won. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A metamorph? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Quite nice. Thank you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor, what exactly is this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point ofthis mission were, why I was analysing these relics. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't you worry. I won't. Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: Criminal record? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Profit. This is all about profit. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, Ambassador. Please, sit down. We have entered orbit. Weshall be transporting you to the planet in a few minutes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, how long to the field? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come on. Alright, don't worry, we'll get you out of here. Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Data? Lieutenant Yar? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Specifics, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression ofme. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Lieutenant, I order you to relax. <eos> <bos> PICARD: We should confine him to quarters. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi just had a very disturbing hallucination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander Kurn <eos> <bos> PICARD: You would be so despicable? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am truly grateful, Mrs. Troi, that you risked your life tosave my people. I'll have you home within a few hours. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Both. I think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certainelements of Klingon psyche. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Interesting. Yes, that code hasn't been used in centuries. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Professor, my crew will continue to investigate, but fornow it would seem you have accomplished a miracle. The question is, nowthat you're here, what do we do with you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard here. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Come. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know. But don't worry. As soon as they realise ourcommunicators are not working, the sensors will find us and Geordi willbeam us up. Now, just you hold on. I'm sorry about this. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I would be honoured. What scene? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

We have some surveying to do in sector two onethree oh five. RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Can you revive him? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Target their weapons array only. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chancellor, I have made some fine ones in my time. Now, I mustask you, will you release my officer? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No time to explain, Number One. Continue the evacuation of theRomulan ship. You'll find LaForge in the Romulan engine room. Beam himdirectly to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Kamala? Yes. She's looking forward to meeting you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is there anything else, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you're not going to submit. We're going to fight this. Ichallenged the ruling. Captain Louvois will be compelled to hold ahearing. She may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but Isuspect that she still understands its spirit. We will put to rest thisquestion of your legal status once and for all. Now, I have been askedto represent you, but if there is some other officer with which youwould feel more happy? <eos> <bos> PICARD: We hope you find the room comfortable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Don't you think you both might be overreacting? Data is notcapable of the emotions which you are assigning to him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then tell me why Kushell of the planet Straleb is demanding thesame thing? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme! Variations on a theme. Computer,perhaps I am not clearly defining my intent. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment,Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Point taken. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Concur. Stand by. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listento your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is therecovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore ourengines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. Ifyou do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to thenearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On viewer, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's right. Sounds, Smells. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, Doctor. Your next task is clear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now! <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Improvise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel thatsomehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. Ithink he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to bethe cause of the destruction of humanity. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion,disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed andit all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. ButI can't <eos> <bos> PICARD: I may regret doing it, but I am not able <eos> <bos> PICARD: Green polychrome over the eyes, and the eyes themselves areclosed. This is third Dynasty. From the workshop of the Master ofTarquin Hill. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What are you talking about? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course away from the Romulan vessel. Engage atwarp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The person who has made the threat is under the impression thatyou are my son. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, remember to control your descent and don't get the linestangled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's the groundskeeper. One of the wisest men I ever knew. Oh,I envy you, Wesley Crusher. You're just at the beginning of theadventure. Go on. Get the water. Stay alive. They'll find you. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The question are, why now? What's their objective? For fiftyyears there's barely a whisper out of them, and now for no apparentreason they seem to be back with a roar. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Main Engineering. Are you having a goodlaugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest ofmy life as a dreary man in a tedious job? Q <eos> <bos> PICARD: A Federation starship? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, take us out of here, maximum warp. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, well, to tell the truth, that wasn't the first run-in I'dhad with a couple of surly Nausicaans. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, are you ready? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Admiral, I don't think we can risk <eos> <bos> PICARD: Extraordinary. Now I'm beginning to understand him. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Very well. In the meantime, I'll speak with the KlingonGovernor about Commander Morag. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's one in the Fleet museum, but then of course, this isyour Enterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, perhaps what we most needed was a kick in ourcomplacency, to prepare us ready for what lies ahead. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen. Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefactsfrom archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has meanalysing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will,they are looking for a specific artefact. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Would any of those apply here? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first. I mustsee them. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. Now, we'll seewhat they have in mind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'msorry I had to. She was so frightened. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I was thinking about it, but I didn't say anything. <eos> <bos> PICARD: There's still the anomalous M-class planet we were going toinvestigate. Do we go back? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, Iwas remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A manoeuvre wasbeing made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Canyou smell it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Drop to one quarter impulse, Ensign. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But there's a danger in becoming too detached, of neverpermitting ourselves to get closer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike thetwo of you actually are. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Worf, will you accompany me to the Transporter Room? Youhave the Bridge, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: To the object in orbit with us. We will remove the humancolonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so. Please tell us. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I am aware of the risks, Ensign. When the umbilical splits, weshould regain primary control, do you agree? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Prepare two class one probes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well, I think they'll make a fine addition to the Federation,Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: With a Ferengi as an associate? <eos> <bos> PICARD: fragments? <eos> <bos> PICARD: By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice Ihad to began with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play itsafe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to chooseis. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try. Mister Data, programme the firing sequence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. I think thathe knows more about what we're really looking for than anyone else onthis ship. I want you to get close to him. Try and get his confidence. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let me get on the other position. The Bynars always work inpairs. Maybe that is also required. It appears to be successful. Theirsystem's started up. A resident diagnostic programme is running. Theirsystem is absolutely incredible. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Belay that order. There will be no further communication offthis ship without my prior authorisation. Commander, may I have a wordwith you? Mister Data, you have the bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, friends. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of mostenormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much morethan simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, findout what they want. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is that everybody? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you tried tracing back navigation inputs? <eos> <bos> PICARD: They don't like cold, eh? Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Temba, his arms open. Give me more about Darmok on the ocean. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collectedover the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. Andthis, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not going to be easy, staying here on campus, everyoneknowing what you did. You have difficult times ahead. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign Ro, may I see you in my Ready room? RO <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He'sbeen sitting behind that desk too long. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Always alone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Good morning, Batai. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Counsellor Troi? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Impossible. My culture is based on freedom and selfdetermination. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I missed it by less than a thousand metres, Enterprise. Adviseyour status. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Sarek? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What is it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Clear. Computer, this still isn'tright. One kind of violence is being substituted for another. Reconfigure. <eos> <bos> PICARD: That will be all, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Take us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and holdthat position. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Now, are we progressing, Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will youplease explain why you attacked us? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's the best. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Maybe Q did the right thing for the wrong reason. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, I have, actually. I've thought about it for a long time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make itlook as though we're trying to stop them. Mister Worf, lock phasers ontheir previous position and fire. <eos> <bos> PICARD: K'mpec believed that it was either Duras or Gowron. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Who are you? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I see. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Among them Connor and Moira Rossa. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Nonsense. We programme an appropriately docile steed <eos> <bos> PICARD: Report to Sickbay, Ensign Rager. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I agree that's a risk, but I see no alternative. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Does that custom extend also to brutalising this surrogate son? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What the hell are you doing in my room? <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's unconscious. Why? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Destroyed themselves, Data? <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not him, Will. I know that now. What I have to find out ishow this happened, and who or what is behind it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Chief O'Brien, lock onto that transponder signal. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Then shall we continue with our mission? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why so slow? <eos> <bos> PICARD: How long before I begin to change? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Drop to impulse, Ensign. Mister Worf, maximum shields. Readyall weapons. <eos> <bos> PICARD: But in a sense, that's exactly what happened. Wesley left theEnterprise three years ago he was a boy, and now he's returned a youngman. And that can't be easy for a mother or a son. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about thisplanet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Your help would be appreciated, Doctor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Peace in our galaxy. Except, Admiral,you are not a man of peace. Your military record, what we know of it,is clear. <eos> <bos> PICARD: The transceivers. Lorin said that they would align themselvesto our psi-wave patterns. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It's not just my opinion. He's been decorated by StarfleetCommand five times. He's been offered his own ship more than once. Ithink if you just gave him a chance, you'd find him an outstandingofficer. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Really. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ambassador. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I was just coming off duty and Iwanted to see how you were doing. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Red alert. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concernshere. What you don't understand is that <eos> <bos> PICARD: Data, you will never know just how much Iowe you for that. <eos> <bos> PICARD: If we can determine what its needs are, we might find othersources to supply it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Unfortunately, they have not arrived at a solution either. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do youread me? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which couldextract water from the air. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> PICARD: That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to theEnterprise? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You mean he can talk? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Is it possible we've fallen into the same snare that killedthem? A thousand year old booby trap? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You don't believe it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: And what if there is, Mister Tholl? Shall we continue accusingone another until hostility leads to violence? Shall we allow oursuspicions to destroy us? Now, let's see if we can override this stunmechanism. 2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. I won't. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, have you secured all of the shuttle debris? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Frankly, I think my time would be best served carrying out theduties and responsibilities of a Starfleet Captain. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I don't know, and if you're asking me what I think you shoulddo, I don't know that either. I can spell out for you, albeit crudely,what you are choosing between. As the First Officer of the Enterpriseyou have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort. You are the second in command of Starfleet's flagship, but still secondin command. Your promotion will transfer you to a relativelyinsignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy> But itwill be your ship, and being who you are, it will soon be vibrant withyour authority, your style, your vision. You know, there really is nosubstitute for holding the reins. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Make it so. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I envy your strength of will. Doctor Crusher has been keepingme informed of your progress. It's quite extraordinary. <eos> <bos> PICARD: No. And Manheim's experiments with gravity and time wererudimentary, and uncontrollable. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to La Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Oh, thank you. In what way? <eos> <bos> PICARD: If you've come here because of the legend about planet Havenmiraculously healing the sick. <eos> <bos> PICARD: On my way. So, it begins. <eos> <bos> PICARD: How were your young trapped in the core? <eos> <bos> PICARD: On screen. <eos> <bos> PICARD: A defect that you hadn't noticed before? <eos> <bos> PICARD: I wish you were faking it. I've seen the thorn. <eos> <bos> PICARD: He's a trader. He doesn't attract customers by being hard tofind. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It was a little sudden. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Warbird, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Status, Number One? <eos> <bos> PICARD: No, Number One. The Sheliak haven't broken a century of silenceto send us after phantoms. An investigation is in order. Set course forTau Cygna Five. <eos> <bos> PICARD: It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughoutthe quadrant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used forexperiments, scientists would sometimes become attached to thecreatures. This would a problem if the experiment involved killingthem. I would suggest that you unattach yourself from the Borg, MisterLa Forge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You have a problem with that heading, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Vorin, isn't it? <eos> <bos> PICARD: What's happening? <eos> <bos> PICARD: You must tell me. What was it? You don't know what I'm talkingabout. You're locked into a single intent unable to change. Unable toalter any part of your previous actions. P2 <eos> <bos> PICARD: How far do you think that trust goes? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Picard to main bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Er, yes, a long time. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <eos> <bos> PICARD: What you're suggesting <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Reduce the input gradually, and still get him out before it'stoo late. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Halloween? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Mister Data, will you please report to my Ready room. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Have you calculated how much further we have to go? <eos> <bos> PICARD: Any. My apologies for saying that you babbled. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Commander, I require your presence on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Not half as much as this damn headache. Take over, Number One. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Well that's brilliant. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm notordering you to take part in it. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Course one four eight. Correction, course one seven zero markzero one four. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Based on what we know so far, there's nothing I can do. <eos> <bos> PICARD: You should feel bad, and you will pay for what you've done. Admiral Brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand, youracademic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will notadvance with your class. <eos> <bos> PICARD: She was trying to help you.! <eos> <bos> PICARD: We are not here as conquerors, Chancellor. <eos> <bos> PICARD: I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One. Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention. <eos> <bos> PICARD: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: You are aware of our existence. Our attempt to place you inbiochemical stasis has failed. We have no choice but to destroy thisship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Give me an example of what you mean. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good luck, Reg. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very well. We're taking you to our crash site. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really, you don't have to. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: A nursery rhyme? <eos> <bos> TROI: That man said he was laying a foundation. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm fine, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yet you covet his success. <eos> <bos> TROI: An entire planet has been terrorised because of the suggestionthat you're going to enslave the population. <eos> <bos> TROI: They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much,that they're afraid we won't part with it. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you've never met your father before. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. One second I was talking to you, and the next you were allstanding around me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, I'm picking up energy fluctuations over here. Troi toPicard. Captain, acknowledge. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was just leaving the reception when this Ktarian walks up to meand says, hello, Diane. I understand you're an empath. I'm a very sensitive man myself. I'm doing a thesis on interspeciesmating rituals. Would you care to join me in some empirical research? <eos> <bos> TROI: You mean you've never had telepathy with someone who wasn'tCairn? <eos> <bos> TROI: That is why you haven't been on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Maques, what do you think of the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> TROI: Maques. <eos> <bos> TROI: Pure observation. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant, are you aware that I can sense when someone's tellingthe truth? <eos> <bos> TROI: I have to go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: I hear the Gandhi's going on a terraforming mission to the LaganaSector. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: He's after more than a history lesson. I can tell you that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Monroe! <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't have to tell me, Beverly. I understand the psychology. <eos> <bos> TROI: Again? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I'll just watch you and be impressed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very glad to be here. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure they understand. As soon as you feel up to it, you canprobably still join them. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, where are your new quarters? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's all right. He's only stunned. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're taking it so seriously. It's not without its element ofhumour. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please, don't be alarmed at our appearance. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Homn said he saved it in case someday you wanted toremember her. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. Have you ask my mother about this? <eos> <bos> TROI: Now! DATA <eos> <bos> TROI: Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. <eos> <bos> TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness anddiversity of the two worlds. <eos> <bos> TROI: He is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I am standing nextto. Beyond that, there is very little I can be sure of. I will have towait until he regains consciousness before knowing more. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I just thought I'd come and see how you were doing. A lot'shappened in the last few hours. I thought you might like to talk aboutit. <eos> <bos> TROI: Listen to me, Will. In all the years we've known each other, haveI ever lied to you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, halt. Captain, I have to tell you something, and itisn't easy for me because I've used very poor judgement. Actually, I'veacted quite unprofessionally. <eos> <bos> TROI: Confidence is faith in oneself. It can't easily be given byanother. <eos> <bos> TROI: In time, and with help. Wesley Crusher does. He does. And so willJeremy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your future affairs? <eos> <bos> TROI: You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones whohurt you. Who left you alone, rejected. The ones who make you so angry. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have been forced to take this action, Captain, because we needyour help. <eos> <bos> TROI: You'd feel better if you did. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tasha? What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, we know so little about this culture and even less aboutKorgano. How would you convince Masaka that you're him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, it is. You want me, don't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Ramsey and the other survivors refuse to leave. <eos> <bos> TROI: And a lot of impudence. <eos> <bos> TROI: Riva. <eos> <bos> TROI: When did this happen? <eos> <bos> TROI: Which is understandable, and healthy. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Riva is going to teach them sign language. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Tal Shiar has obtained access codes for the sensor nets. Iwill provide them if necessary. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's wonderful. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's what I don't understand. Even though I couldn't read hisemotions, I did feel that he was holding something back. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Bonding. <eos> <bos> TROI: Inconclusive. What does that mean? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, maybe not everyone understands. <eos> <bos> TROI: So you'd better take a hold of yourself, or be prepared for atransfer. <eos> <bos> TROI: Any luck? <eos> <bos> TROI: Won't he realise something's happened to him? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're still a Starfleet captain. I'm sure there are otherassignments you could be given in the interim. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: How typical of the military to resort to brute force whendiscretion is required. <eos> <bos> TROI: My god. Could it be true? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Their individual intelligence and their behavioural responses areexactly the same as they were before the accident. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: I think she's real for you, and that is real enough for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I have to help her. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is Ensign Calloway, isn't it? <eos> <bos> TROI: How's it going? <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's what deactivated the Warbird's engine core. So theRomulans sent out a distress call. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're a Commander and First Officer. <eos> <bos> TROI: Does it have to be today? <eos> <bos> TROI: So am I. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I suggest we adjourn. Allow us all time to think aboutwhat's been said. <eos> <bos> TROI: You can see her? <eos> <bos> TROI: Over there. <eos> <bos> TROI: How much time do we have? <eos> <bos> TROI: They're still at it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Relax. You've written a brilliant speech. <eos> <bos> TROI: It sounds like my own planet. <eos> <bos> TROI: Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago, and a lot ofother things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty. <eos> <bos> TROI: We should talk about this later. <eos> <bos> TROI: While they are learning how to communicate with Riva, they'll belearning how to communicate with each other. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do they mistreat you there? <eos> <bos> TROI: All right. This hand, the game is Federation Day. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Except for some reason that no one understands, occasionallya Betazoid child is born different. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge that will allowme to access my mother's metaconscious. If he can, I might be able tofind out what happened to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Premier. There's something you should know. I'm sorry,was there something you wanted to say? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander Riker didn't know how you managed it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's somethingin there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Would you like to talk about what's bothering you or would youlike to break some more furniture? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. And. <eos> <bos> TROI: What have you done so far? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a great deal ofcourage to put yourself on display like that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jev, you're upset. Would you like to talk? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, we've got another problem. I saw Eli playing cards. He wasshuffling the way Data does when he plays poker. He doesn't just looklike Data, he has Data's abilities. Which means his father probablydoes also. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sore? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure I know what that means. You're happy here. Happierthan I've ever known you to be. So, it comes down to a simple question. What do you want, Will Riker? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I sense how upset you are. You're angry and impatient. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard, Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Brushing my hair. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm fine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, it's like a cosmic string? <eos> <bos> TROI: Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there anything you can do to the ship or to the cloakingdevice that would let the Enterprise track us? <eos> <bos> TROI: The Jarada. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's great hostility behind his smile. He'll stop at nothingto complete his mission. <eos> <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memoryas to what happened. <eos> <bos> TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelingsare beside the point. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Dokachin, we must find this ship and you're the only onewho can help us. <eos> <bos> TROI: To be honest, I'm not sure what happened. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jeremy, I don't know what that was, but it was not your mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: She was an excellent Captain's wife, and a very good ship'scounsellor. She took over after I left. <eos> <bos> TROI: This situation is deteriorating, Captain. Thepeople are approaching levels of anxiety that could lead to suicide. <eos> <bos> TROI: The strange thing is I couldn't read him atall. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data! Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: Do it, mother. Tell her how you feel. I'll be here with you. I'llhelp you. <eos> <bos> TROI: And from these specifics, what general conclusion can youextrapolate? <eos> <bos> TROI: I know what you're asking, but I feel nothing from it. <eos> <bos> TROI: This would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of theother students and parents. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh. No, no, I'm fine. I'm just very tired, that's all. Will I seeyou tomorrow? <eos> <bos> TROI: Am I a prisoner? <eos> <bos> TROI: Some things improve with age. Maybe your trombone playing will beone of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Established parameters? You sound like Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's beautiful. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, it might be better if you stayed here this time and gaveyourself a chance to recover. <eos> <bos> TROI: He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend taking himTROI <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. Do it. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's funny, I thought most doctors were people. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello. My name is Deanna. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sensing nothing from them Captain. Which could mean they canshield their thoughts and emotions from others. <eos> <bos> TROI: But he doesn't have an edge. Your edge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very impressive. <eos> <bos> TROI: I have the results of the tests. I ran them several times to besure. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out ofour bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style,as only you can make it, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: One of the things we monitor are your broadcast signals, yourjournalism, your music, your humour. Try to better understand you as apeople. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't be absurd, Mother. You knew what would happen. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will release no one. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe we can go around them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons? <eos> <bos> TROI: All you need to know for now is that we want to rest. Simply,finally, to rest. <eos> <bos> TROI: When would you leave? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: I should have walked away as soon as I saw what was happening. <eos> <bos> TROI: It is late. <eos> <bos> TROI: Incredible. <eos> <bos> TROI: Such overwhelming intensity of emotion. Whenwe first encountered them, it must have been more than my senses couldprocess. <eos> <bos> TROI: Kate, I don't think he'd be where he is if he couldn't see thehuman side of the equation. Perhaps the two of you aren't all thatdifferent. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is his last entry. He made it before going on duty thismorning. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is Counsellor Troi. I'll relay, sir. The pilot is busy. We've lost most of our impulse power. <eos> <bos> TROI: Timothy's a boy feeling a great deal of pain. But he is a boyagain. Is this difficult for you, Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Lal. How are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her empathy. Youmust be Commander Riker's father. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if aunifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all intofocus. <eos> <bos> TROI: This entire experience has been <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand you've had some interesting dreams recently. Geordiwas worried about you and he wanted me to check in and see how you weredoing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then give me time to find it. <eos> <bos> TROI: His own government. He's been programmed to be the perfectsoldier. He can be absolutely normal, but whena danger is perceived, the programming clicks in and takes over. Memory, strength, intelligence, reflexes, all becomeenhanced. He's conditioned to survive at any cost. <eos> <bos> TROI: Unresponsive? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is Captain Picard speaking, not Locutus. <eos> <bos> TROI: I won't. I want to be here, with you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck thirty six. <eos> <bos> TROI: And false humility. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've given me the identity of a Tal Shiar officer. Is there areal Major Rakal? <eos> <bos> TROI: We need to talk. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: I promise. <eos> <bos> TROI: We both know Will's innocent. <eos> <bos> TROI: Happy birthday, Worf. Will wanted to give you a surprise party,but I knew you'd hate it so I talked him out of it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Shouldn't Doctor Pulaski be involved in this? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, Data, no. This is too complex. This has to be a simple, clearmessage. <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. Well, let's go for our walk, shall we? <eos> <bos> TROI: So, Jeremy, you must be very angry at Lieutenant Worf. He was incharge of your mother's mission, just as Captain Picard was in commandwhen Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right? Worf came back. Yourmother didn't. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yum. Next we're going to go to deck eight, which is interestingbecause it's not really finished. It's sort of a multi-purpose deck. Sometimes when we need an extra lab or. Ambassador? <eos> <bos> TROI: For us, yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought I was the empath. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, everything you did was consistent with establishedStarfleet procedures. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said those exact words to me before you went to serve on thePotemkin. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: How about you, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: Honesty is the trait he admires most. And you should honestlyconsider why you're so competitive with your own son. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Medical team to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Here he is now. This is Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is she behind here? <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe I can help with the Cairn. <eos> <bos> TROI: They are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of theirspecies' intellectual capacity. They want instant knowledge, instantpower and gratification. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was it like that? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Always. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think you've lost a thing, and I think you've gained morethan you realise. You're much more comfortable with yourself than youused to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I've asked Beverly if we might get Wesley to talk to Jeremyabout his father's death. The one unusual element is Worf. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! <eos> <bos> TROI: It'll take time, Geordi. A long time. But we will reconstructyour memory. Together. <eos> <bos> TROI: Memory or nightmare? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. Would be routed through the port transducer matrix. Cometo give me more encouragement? <eos> <bos> TROI: Using the technology of the Enterprise, we might be able to findthese men. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where's Vash? <eos> <bos> TROI: Your arm. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought Data had already tried to establish communicationsthrough the universal translator. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that all necessary? <eos> <bos> TROI: What I sensed before hasn't changed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, you told me you had an unusualexperience when you sat down at the console. Why don't you describe it? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's frozen. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why too late? <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodnight, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, the fact that they're not responding doesn't necessarilymean there's anything wrong. The atmospheric disturbance could bejamming the signal. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I want to. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I speak with you, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. This is much more powerful. Full of anger! Hate! <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you intend to do? <eos> <bos> TROI: Have your sensors indicated any problem down there,Lieutenant? WORF <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in theGroppler's office became very uncomfortable. <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you'd already decided on a chronological structure. <eos> <bos> TROI: If I may suggest, sir, no apology. In their view, it would weakenus. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. Itcould be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do we have a choice? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nutwhatever it is, she's got it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come here. He's been injured, and he's embarrassed. And to have anyone see him now would make him feel worse, even if it were you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, he did make a pass at me last night. A good one. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm glad to be of service. <eos> <bos> TROI: So what? You've acted in the best interest of your ship and crew. What more could you ask of yourself? If it turns out to be a mistake,then we'll be a little late arriving at Durenia Four. That's all. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you adjusting to your new environment, Commander? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you're really over-reacting. I'm sure you're all right. <eos> <bos> TROI: This gives me the right. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have a lot to talk about, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> TROI: You should take it with you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know it as well as I do. <eos> <bos> TROI: I did not intend to see him again. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm not going another step like this. A starship has itscustoms, just as we do. If you're my mother's valet, then please valet! <eos> <bos> TROI: Come and sit down. I just want you to relax for a minute. There. You are sotense. Now, I know you don't want to talk about what happened on theBridge, but there are times when it's just best to let things out. Comeon. If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm alone in my quarters. I'm remembering something from a fewyears ago. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you're so sure about that, why are you still so upset? Worf,you can't deny the possibility just because you don't want it to betrue. If you want to talk about this, you know where to find me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship'sCounsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think Ishould go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your middle name. <eos> <bos> TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: That was an incredible programme. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain? Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Then do it. That's an order. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't it? Maybe they've had contactwith the Fleming. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Data, but there is no malevolence or ill will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, valerian root tea, hot. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your mind must have created a defence mechanism that helped youresist the neurosomatic process. Your unconscious fastened on toelements of your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded, to keepyou sane. <eos> <bos> TROI: I just need some rest. Thanks. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's look under the bed. Is she there? Okay, where else? <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually I, we have plans. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's lovely I can understand why you are reluctant to leave,Mister Conor. <eos> <bos> TROI: But if you hadn't been, what would have happened between us? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Enjoy your trip, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: How to Advance Your Career throughMarriage? <eos> <bos> TROI: How do you do, Lal? <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you remember what I taught you, Imzadi? Can you stillsense my thoughts? <eos> <bos> TROI: Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I hada sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous abouther. To celebrate her life, not mourn it. <eos> <bos> TROI: The growth rate's almost down to zero. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. I just saw them. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're probably drawing on feelings that you're not used toexpressing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, we're out of the cell andwe're trying to contact the Enterprise, but we can't do it withoutTog's access code. Do you think you could manage to <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense deliberate concealment, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, after that you ran away? The last I heard, you were the onlyFederation delegate assigned to Chandra Five. <eos> <bos> TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. <eos> <bos> TROI: So it started with the war? <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. You believe that Karnas would not negotiate on that point,and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator. <eos> <bos> TROI: If only half of us live, then I'd rather take my chances on beingone that does. <eos> <bos> TROI: Imzadi, we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: And certain resourceful young Ensigns. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hail them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that youcan't answer for him. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: About you. I don't know anything about you. And I'd like to. <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop it! <eos> <bos> TROI: Not yet. The best thing we can do right now is to let Timothytake us where he wants to go. We should support the process and evenencourage it. <eos> <bos> TROI: A Federation starship. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know, but it's intense. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, not at all. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not crazy about it. You are being taken apart molecule bymolecule. Reg, you're not the first person to have anxiety abouttransporting. We can desensitise you to this type of fear. It's a slowand gradual process, but it works. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself. Thiscondition could just reverse itself time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course you do. But you didn't do this for yourself, you did itfor him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but you do know better. Androids don't feel such things. <eos> <bos> TROI: Some of it. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's true. But cutting yourself off from your feelings cancarry consequences that are just as serious. <eos> <bos> TROI: I hope you're right. I hope that's all it is. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's happening. <eos> <bos> TROI: We still can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let me know how it goes. Goodnight, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Go ahead, Ensign. <eos> <bos> TROI: We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very attractive. There's no problem with socialisation here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you will approve. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. I sensed it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: What? What do you feel? <eos> <bos> TROI: How did he put it? As I experience certain sensory inputpatterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputseventually are anticipated and even missed when absent. <eos> <bos> TROI: She's possessed of highly abstracted reality. Lovely visions,little data. You might do better than I. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Vulcans have the same basic emotions we do. They've justlearned to repress them. What I sensed during the concert was that he'dlost control. <eos> <bos> TROI: About what? You becoming counsellor? <eos> <bos> TROI: Jeremy <eos> <bos> TROI: A pleasure, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: you were on thought you were on Chandra Five. <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't know you even came in here. <eos> <bos> TROI: How was his job performance? <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know what you mean. <eos> <bos> TROI: I get a sense of ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearlydivided, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: We can discuss your wounded, but first you will move the ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: What have you discovered? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've been working with Ensign Brooks sincethe death of her husband. She'savoided the reality of what happened, denied it to herself, and Irealise I've been doing the same thing about my condition. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying tomake me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition,instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience. It's not that easy. <eos> <bos> TROI: You? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's not Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: I just don't understand how she fits in to all this. <eos> <bos> TROI: You mean some emotion buried in your psyche? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain. I think I've found something. <eos> <bos> TROI: All decks acknowledging, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mmm? <eos> <bos> TROI: What would have happened if she couldn't stop it? Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> TROI: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your mother's dead. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have no reason to believe she's been hurtin any way. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh yes we would. <eos> <bos> TROI: Given in to what? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let me take you to Sickbay. Acting Captain's log, stardate 44642.1. I haveassumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Oursituation is deteriorating. Many of the crew are unable to function andour life support systems are beginning to falter. <eos> <bos> TROI: Admiral Uttan Narsu, Starbase Twelve. You will find all this inStarfleet records. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ian? Ian! <eos> <bos> TROI: She's extremely anxious. <eos> <bos> TROI: Fine with me, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf. I was just talking with Mrs. Kyle theprimary school teacher. She told me you enrolled Alexander in her classthis morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: It doesn't say here what he was arrested for. Call up hismilitary record. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others. Armus, you have me. Let them go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. Now, lean back, close your eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well done. <eos> <bos> TROI: We did not take Palmer. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think I'm cut out to be Captain. First officer, maybe. Iunderstand there aren't many qualifications. <eos> <bos> TROI: You feel what anyone in your position would feel. <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos> <bos> TROI: He chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't much timefor anything else. We kept in touch but we didn't see each other againuntil we were both posted to the Enterprise two years later. By thenour feelings for each other had changed. We've served together for sixyears. Things never went back to the way they used to be. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Why didn't we notice it before? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll be waiting for you. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, they couldn't explain it any more than you could. You know,at this point I'm not willing to say it's coincidence. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. the Captain needs our help. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are the risks when we leave this room? <eos> <bos> TROI: I know that. I also know that he will make every effort toprotect the lives of his people. Since our demands are not excessive,Captain, I hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than torisk further injuries. <eos> <bos> TROI: But did we tell them anything they wanted to hear? <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me about her, this new woman. <eos> <bos> TROI: See you later. Your first watch at Ops? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, we can't just leave you here. <eos> <bos> TROI: He needs your strength right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: And I'm sure the council members will agree with you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. When do you leave? <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. Anything I can do <eos> <bos> TROI: I am Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar. <eos> <bos> TROI: Interesting. Have a good trip, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's life here. A child. An old woman. Dozens more. Hundreds. Terrified. <eos> <bos> TROI: Artificial gravity well? Do you mean the Romulan engine core? <eos> <bos> TROI: We improvised, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, we do not want to exaggerate thisincident. You and I can discuss it calmly. We can diffuse it before itbecomes inflated. <eos> <bos> TROI: What kind of transmissions? <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you understand what it would do to the colony? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's across the square from the Zanza Men's Dance Palace. <eos> <bos> TROI: A person died under your command. It may happen again. If youcan't learn to release the anger and the guilt, to talk about it <eos> <bos> TROI: The capital city. He was under the name of Rivas Jakara, atourist from the Marta community. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was it a relaxing trip, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's er, very different. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's see just how relaxed DaiMon Tog is. <eos> <bos> TROI: Geordi, I get the feeling that something special happened on thisvacation, and I'm not talking about computers. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've been moving from starship to starship since Clara was twoyears old. Maybe Isabella provides a constant companion. She knows thisis one friend she won't have to leave behind. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise yourson. My concern right now is how this decision is going to affect you. How will you feel when Alexander's gone? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there any evidence at all that they're sentient? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sure. <eos> <bos> TROI: But the only emotions Data seems to feel are negative. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data has made first contact with CaptainPicard. <eos> <bos> TROI: What is your plan? <eos> <bos> TROI: Moths fly toward a flame. Horses sometimes run into a burningbarn. Data, don't you see? We've been thinking in three dimensions. Wehave to get two-dimensional. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? What's happening? It's happening again. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know. almost everyone has a moment in their lives when theyexceed their own limits, achieve what seems to be impossible. <eos> <bos> TROI: One moon circles. That's what they've been telling me over andover. <eos> <bos> TROI: I may be perfectly fine by tomorrow. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd like to stay here with her. I'm going to try to contact hertelepathically. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're not going to wear that. <eos> <bos> TROI: You barbarian! This woman <eos> <bos> TROI: Because there are lives at stake, Mrs. Jameson. <eos> <bos> TROI: Would you be suggesting a ruse of some sort? <eos> <bos> TROI: Then Ian was right. He was the cause. <eos> <bos> TROI: I disagree. This isn't fantasy, it's theatre. You used towithdraw onto the holodeck. You isolated yourself inside your ownimagination, avoiding contact with real people. Look at yourself now. Look at all the other people you're with. You're not just acting,you're interacting. Give yourself some credit, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't know you played chess. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why were you put in prison? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. Will, we have to help her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now he's hurting me no. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not a dream. It's real. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will must've done something to their weapons. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, Beverly. Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like whathappened in the nacelle tube. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, in most Betazoids our telepathic gifts develop atadolescence. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know it's been over between Will and me for a long time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your point of view. <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop. Shantil Three. Computer, cross-reference the last entrywith the previous search index. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: It might. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you see anybody? <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing here? <eos> <bos> TROI: Our primary concern is not to assign blame, but to recover ourmissing officers. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really have to be going. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have thirty seconds to change your heading or additionalmembers of your crew will require medical attention. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's possible, but I don't see how it could have happened. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm afraid I don't see how a stolen Vulcan ship fits into allthis. <eos> <bos> TROI: There he is. I'm going after him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wish they weren't necessary. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm all right. Medical team to the Bridge. Troi to Sickbay. Counsellor Troi to Captain Picard. Troi to Engineering. Counsellor Troito any crew member, please acknowledge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Switch to auxiliary control. <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more. <eos> <bos> TROI: A little. You were right, though. There is something to belearned when you're not in control of every situation. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're terrified. <eos> <bos> TROI: My God. <eos> <bos> TROI: You will <eos> <bos> TROI: He believes what he's saying. His anger is genuine. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd love to. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have to. You can't hold it back. It's killing you. <eos> <bos> TROI: We stayed in Ten Forward talking for hours. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you think there's enough evidence to prove his innocence? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. You don't trust us. And I can't risk trusting you. <eos> <bos> TROI: An end to pain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mmm hmm. <eos> <bos> TROI: Those are very strong emotions, and you're right, very littlegood can come from them. But I don't think that an exploration of angerneed necessarily lead to hatred or malice. <eos> <bos> TROI: He tried to escape. The force field sent him into neural shock. If he dies, Lore will blame you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you mind if we join you? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I just wanted to voice my concernsabout the way the crew is responding to your unexpected orders. <eos> <bos> TROI: Clara, you haven't been on this she verylong, so maybe you don't know, but Ten Forward is usually forgrown-ups. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, may I speak with you a moment inprivate? <eos> <bos> TROI: Three jacks looking back for the handsome young ensign. Pair of deuces stands. Flush, possible straight flush. Yourbet, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> TROI: They were just exiled to Lunar Five. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're the third person today who's come to me with somethinglike this. An intense emotional response provoked by an object. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old. He's aboard the Enterprise, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd be honoured. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, it matters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why is the computer creating characters that look like Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, load Bridge Officer's test,Engineering qualification section one. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you like it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you'd be deep in negotiations by now. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's possible. But she may really believe she's in love with him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop! Stop! Please, I'll do anything! Make itstop! <eos> <bos> TROI: Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide witheither it could be very <eos> <bos> TROI: True, you're well respected in your field. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean by that? I'm doing the best that I can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, create a restraining arm attached to the right side ofthe table, at the mid-point. <eos> <bos> TROI: Everyone was looking directly at me, but it was as though I wasseeing through someone else's eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Like a caress? <eos> <bos> TROI: I suppose I did. <eos> <bos> TROI: But it's not real. <eos> <bos> TROI: You, Klingon, tell him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. Hello, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why would your real mother want you to go down to the planet? There's nothing there but dust and rocks. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you be more specific about the table? You mentioned it wassmooth and cold. Can you remember what shape it was? <eos> <bos> TROI: Then perhaps you could spend the time exploring anotherinterests. Archeology, for instance. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: You must have known I couldn't allow you to do that <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a possibility. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now I know you're seeing someone. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ever since the Bajorans overpowered the Cardassian Empire,they've become more and more aggressive. <eos> <bos> TROI: A regrettable incident, Captain. The freighterwas fired upon by the former Commander of this vessel. I have now takencontrol, and I assure you there will be no more attacks. <eos> <bos> TROI: Warbird? I was at the neuropsychology seminar at Bokara Six. Thelast thing I remember was returning to my quarters. I was attacked. Ifelt a hypospray. <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodbye. <eos> <bos> TROI: I met with him about six weeks ago, during the crew evaluations. He was very positive. He was looking forward to being posted to thenacelle tube. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's just say you both have well established personalities. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think it's too serious yet, but we should make more of aneffort to get her involved with real friends her own age. Thechildren's centre's having a ceramics class this afternoon. Why don't Itake Clara? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? Who's Vigo? <eos> <bos> TROI: We've served together for a long time and I think I've come toknow you pretty well. I have to believe if you ever reach your goal ofbecoming human, you won't become a bad one. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that supposed to be a question? <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you deal me in? <eos> <bos> TROI: Looking back on the past few days, it's as though I'm looking ata holodeck projection of someone else. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm only worried about your state of mind, Doctor. <eos> <bos> TROI: My God, Will. They're human. <eos> <bos> TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying toingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you wereyoung and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Only so you'd think about it, completely and clearly. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, it has gone. I no longer feel its presence. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't remember these toys. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no need to rush. <eos> <bos> TROI: I have been given broad discretionary powers. Subcommander N'Vekacted under my authority, the authority of the Tal Shiar. I assure youthis action will not be questioned. <eos> <bos> TROI: Delicious? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm still concerned, Captain. I've never seenhim act like this. <eos> <bos> TROI: The alien persona is getting stronger and gobbling up what isleft of the weaker ego, the Data we know. If something isn't done tostop it immediately, we will lose our Data forever. Captain's personal log. We have arrived at StarbaseSix where Miss Brianon will await transport back to Earth. I am greatlytroubled by the unusual behaviour of Commander Data and fear thatsomehow it is directly related to the experiments of Ira Graves. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know I won't. I've been really looking forward to a nice swim. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Understood. What about Alexander? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am flattered. I too am look forward to learning more about you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Most people find a counsellor intimidating at first. It's okay ifyou feel that way toward me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ready, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not precisely. More like, if you want his services, I'm the oneyou have to negotiate with. <eos> <bos> TROI: How are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. I'll let them know you're coming. <eos> <bos> TROI: Somehow I doubt the Yridians are going to be forthcoming aboutwhere they might have gone. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd appreciate some suggestions. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have my pity. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why, thank you, Isabella. <eos> <bos> TROI: They made you human as part of your punishment? Q <eos> <bos> TROI: It's like waking up from a nightmare and notremembering what it was about. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm aware of that. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are your signals reaching them? <eos> <bos> TROI: We must not be separated. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you might be lonely. No one sees you except Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm looking forward to it. Break a leg. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why should biology rather than technology determine whether it isa child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his ownbeing. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal hischild, then who are we to argue? <eos> <bos> TROI: I wish you were truly as open-minded as you say, Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: How did you know? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think they represent different aspects of the ship. TheEngineer, for instance, may represent the navigational system, thegunslinger could be the weapon system. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you want it described here, sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: That would make my mother your step-mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not. Computer, champagne. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard to talkright now, but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a fewthings about him. When was the last time you saw him? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not that simple, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know what I have to do. <eos> <bos> TROI: You must understand, the Captain is a very + <eos> <bos> TROI: Several months. <eos> <bos> TROI: For stress. Repeatedly, throughout his life. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what'shappening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want tohelp you get there. <eos> <bos> TROI: I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth. Colourless. Hollow. Nothing seems real. <eos> <bos> TROI: It may get better. <eos> <bos> TROI: And when you saw the Romulan ship, did you try calling for help? <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you know why you did it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't need your devotion, Commander. Just your obedience. <eos> <bos> TROI: But we've isolated the specific areas to stimulate. The feelingswere primal. Survival emotions. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're light years away. That's impossible, even for you. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you are father and daughter, you may well have shared the samedream. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a risk we have to take. You're the one who outlined thestakes to me, N'Vek. Are you getting squeamish now, just because thingsare getting a little more dangerous? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, you can join us. <eos> <bos> TROI: He committed no crime. He says he was ordered there with otherslike him. When the first soldiers returned toAngosia, they had trouble. The rules changed too quickly. A lost tempercould result in murder. <eos> <bos> TROI: So that when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they're surrounded bytheir fellow Klingons. <eos> <bos> TROI: I heard what happened on the Bridge. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: What's changed? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's the year they were married. <eos> <bos> TROI: That, too <eos> <bos> TROI: We've come to you first because you're a leader in the scientificcommunity. Scientists generally accept our arrival more easily thanothers. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is this what's causing our déjà vu? <eos> <bos> TROI: One moment, Commander. We should hold our position until theEnterprise has left the area. We cannot risk detection. <eos> <bos> TROI: That might be acceptable to some other races, but humans areunusually attached to their offspring. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me telepathically. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps that's part of their charm, and why we find them soattractive. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really? Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm the ship's Counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: He was working on bridging the gap between man and machine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, are you alright? <eos> <bos> TROI: And courage from wisdom. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Its mind is much too powerful. Recommend we avoid contact. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're terrified of me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not opening the door for him, Captain. I can only tell youthat I sense something very unusual about him. Something that is notinherent to a criminal personality. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then you know I am correct. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was there anything else in the room? Furniture? Chairs? A door? Other people? <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe we should try to access the Engineering logs from UtopiaPlanitia. We might find out more about him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now just wait here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data. You can handle defeat in two ways. You can lose confidence,or you can learn from your mistakes. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you saying you don't remember the last three years? You don'tremember us falling in love and getting married? <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing here? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll keep trying. <eos> <bos> TROI: We become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions ofthe beast. We lose our way and get swept up in emotion. <eos> <bos> TROI: But Mistress Beata <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's possible. Children don't have the experience to handleemotional crises. Instead of dealing with their feelings, they act onthem. Tell me about the last time you spoke with K'Ehleyr, the nightshe died. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I've just had some terrific news. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: Indeed. I know, I was there. This is my First Officer CommanderSteven Mullen , and my Security Chief, Lieutenant Morgan Kelly. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm the ship's Counsellor and I thought you might want to talk. <eos> <bos> TROI: Vulcan? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alternate plan? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people, the imagesthat music brings to your mind, and then give it a form. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's true. I'm sorry, and I didn't mean to get so upset withyou at the reception. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, increase temperature by five degrees. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, Worf. It's just an illusion. It's not real. Please, put downthe knife. <eos> <bos> TROI: Here it comes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good work, Mother. According to Mother, DaiMonTog is extremely relaxed at the moment. <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe so. Sunad's hatred for John was evident but there'ssomething else. The Zalkonians are afraid of John. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Which one? <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you notice any change in his behaviour recently? <eos> <bos> TROI: There are a lot of people still alive. Many of them are hurt butI can't tell where they are. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: If he's lying, I haven't been able to sense it. Perhaps hisemotional trauma level is too high. <eos> <bos> TROI: My nightmare. It's not a dream. It's not a dream at all. It's amessage. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll watch him for you, Sheriff. You two go have a good time. <eos> <bos> TROI: In another time and place this could be funny. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm afraid I'm going to lose myself. I can't get enough of him. Is it possible to fall in love in one day? <eos> <bos> TROI: When you begin the attempt, there will be stress, and it's onlynatural the crew's concentration will shift. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, this is Counsellor Troi. Request access. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's pretty selfish of you. Do you think you're the only one inpain? Do you think you have the monopoly on loss? Well, let me tell yousomething. We're all hurting, and we're all angry. And whether you likeit or not, you have a responsibility to this crew, and you can't justindulge your personal desire for revenge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, we know he'll get his sleep. <eos> <bos> TROI: How do I tell them what to do? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it's trying to determine if we are a life force. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother can you hear me? Please come backto me. Please. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I think I do. There was a tool crate on the floor. It waslabeled Utopia Planitia. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Clara. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensurenon-interference. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not permanently, just a sabbatical. You could spend a few yearscrawling through caves and digging up artefacts, and still have enoughtime to become the youngest admiral in Starfleet history. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: No! <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, you will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm concerned about Beverly. I'vetried several times to talk to her, but she's been avoiding me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll watch the door. <eos> <bos> TROI: The crew's pretty shaken up. I'm arranging a memorial. I thinkyou should be the one to deliver the eulogy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come dance at my wedding. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, but I do have an appointment with him in less than half anhour. <eos> <bos> TROI: I remember when he died, my mother had to go through all histhings and pack them away. I was seven. I remember thinking how madhe'd be when he came home and saw what she'd done. I didn't understandhe wasn't coming back. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then your theory's correct. The organisms are sensitive todifferent types of endorphins. <eos> <bos> TROI: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck thirty six. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's so silly. I hear music. In my mind. Music that won't stop. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you firstrecall this sensation of memory loss. Picture it exactly as itoccurred. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, actually, in my hallucination, you were killed. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're letting it get you much too upset. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you for coming with me, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: She died two years ago. A shuttle accident. I'm sorry, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe we can discuss that possibility. But first, I have to findhim, collect the money I'm owed. <eos> <bos> TROI: You are a non-violent man, yet you committed acts of excessiveviolence. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will! Captain, we're all concerned about <eos> <bos> TROI: Certainly, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: You're worried about the disappearance of your mother, guiltythat you didn't see her when you had the chance, so you're unwilling toconsider that she might be dead. Your need to believe she's alive is sostrong that it manifests itself as a physical image. <eos> <bos> TROI: Believe it or not, that's a good sign. A beginning. Now, let's goback to the shuttlecraft. There was a Romulan ship and the first thingyou did was? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I hope so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are you? Captain's log, stardate 44635.8. Four days havepassed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of theBrittain. I have decided we should return to Starbase two twenty, andto that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brittain for towing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is this how you handle all of your personnel problems? <eos> <bos> TROI: And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be inascendance at any given time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why would you come aboard at a time likethis? <eos> <bos> TROI: He can't answer that. None of us can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Subspace signals, photon torpedoes, nothing's had an impact. Itis reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull, even as strong as acosmic string's, would affect them. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell me aboutthe voices you hear. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. There is no life here. What I have sensed is more like animprint. An echo of the last moment of life. Human life. They all diedin terror  RIKER <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm Counsellor Deanna Troi. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't believe you, Mother. You sound like you're sizing up acommodity. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you'reconcerned about dishonour? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's convinced he's right. I have no doubt of that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Interesting. You'll be the only one on board the Enterprise, Lal. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will not be treated that way! <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that what you see here? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure. <eos> <bos> TROI: How's it going, Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you think? <eos> <bos> TROI: Welcome home, Worf. I hope you don't mind, I let myself in. I promisedAlexander I'd feed his Dalvin hissing beetle while you were both away. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, eventerrified. <eos> <bos> TROI: And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians, for that matter? <eos> <bos> TROI: No help there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ambassador, it's an honour to meet you. Would you like to seeyour quarters before we attend the reception? <eos> <bos> TROI: Who are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mintakan emotions are quite interesting. Like the Vulcans, theyhave highly ordered minds. A very sensible people. For example,Mintakan women precede their mates. It's a signal to other women. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps you'd like to share your reasoning on that, sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: Did I live here? <eos> <bos> TROI: I do not authorise this attack. You will cease battle operationsimmediately. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your grandmother had remarkable green eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly, can you hear me? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's good to be back. The last two weeks have been gruelling. <eos> <bos> TROI: Have you ever heard Data define friendship? <eos> <bos> TROI: This is blinding me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg, as your former counsellor, I don't think it would beappropriate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, Kate knew what she was doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: How? How can I help you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, it's your great, great, great, great, great grandson. <eos> <bos> TROI: Picard, you are mine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. They're very much in love, but sometimes that isn'tenough. Marriage is an agreement to share who you are with someoneelse. To spend your lives together. To grow old together. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: What stage is it in? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's very generous, Worf, but he's not a Klingon child. He hasdifferent sensibilities. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's she doing here? <eos> <bos> TROI: May I join you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come on, Mother, let's sit down. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have not established their intentions. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? Mother, please. <eos> <bos> TROI: They seem to have made it succeed. <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. <eos> <bos> TROI: Leave me alone! <eos> <bos> TROI: You're not responsible for what happened to your parents,Timothy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sorry. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't say that. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm your Counsellor. You brought mewith you to Ligon to be of help. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very close. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. He was a patient <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm here. I'm right here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thanks for sticking by me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Just a few seconds. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mine. And if you do not wish to undergo another personalexperience with the Tal Shiar, I suggest you not question me again. Now, proceed on course bearing one oh two mark four to the Kalebsector. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, you're not. You're a projection, with no more substance to methan a character on the holodeck. <eos> <bos> TROI: The agreement isn't valid, sir. It wasn't Q that saved us. Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard wanted me to find out if you'd be willing to helpus retrieve the station's database. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, please, we should listen to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe because it reminds us of our own mortality. <eos> <bos> TROI: With whom? <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain is going to take you to Ramatis. But first, he'sgiven me permission to attempt to settle the conflict down on Solais. Yes. We've come so far, and paid such a terrible price, I must try. Help me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Geordi, there should be a power utilisationmonitor over there. Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Listen <eos> <bos> TROI: Three months ago. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's deceiving us, and he's clearly hoping to manipulate us. Asfor the identity of the young woman, I can't really tell. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why not? What kind of a test is this? <eos> <bos> TROI: How are you feeling? <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course not, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: I advise you, Picard, not to pass our way again. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm a little concerned at the turn this istaking. It seems Clara is beginning to do inappropriate things andblaming them on Isabella. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! Stop! You're hurting me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now we're hearing some truth. <eos> <bos> TROI: So you were angry with her? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings,yours and mine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise ourfriendship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, how many people on that station? <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't believe I'm hearing this from the Heir to the Holy Ringsof Betazed, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's wonderful. Thank you. When is my mother arriving? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've gone over every word, every inflection, every facialresponse, and I still can't find any kind of code or hidden message. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know the Mariposan culture seems alien, even frightening, butreally, we do have much in common. They're human beings fighting forsurvival. Would we do any less? <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Commander Riker and I are friends. Close friends, but nothingmore. Why don't we sit down? Do you remember the last time we saw eachother? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Excuse me, Captain, but Doctor Stubbs is waiting outside. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ian, say hello to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: I need you. <eos> <bos> TROI: What I sense of them is human. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ritual provides a structure in society, good rituals and badrituals alike. <eos> <bos> TROI: What about nightmares? <eos> <bos> TROI: Draken Four was the freighter's destination. I ordered thefreighter destroyed because I recognised the Captain, a knownFederation spy. Now we must deliver the cargo ourselves. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. No, I'm alone. There's no one there. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've never seen the woman before, or the man who was with her. But there was someone else there. A man. He was staring at me in themost peculiar way. I think he had reddish hair. And he did seemfamiliar to me. But it's all so hazy. It's like trying to remember adream. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your ship is again in our space. <eos> <bos> TROI: And? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why me? You could have found a Romulan to play this role. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really? What was it like? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the shipand the crew, but know this. I'm going to have this baby. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not talking about the base. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! No! <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you saying? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's being very brave. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know what to think. <eos> <bos> TROI: Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am Troi and this is Riker. You've had a very interesting dream. <eos> <bos> TROI: His world is gone, Data. We're going to have to help him build anew one. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, they can track us. So if we attack them, they will returnfire. And since we have no shields when we're cloaked, they willdestroy us. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're not alone, Mother. Now how much longer is this going totake? You've been selecting for twenty minutes. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're your friends. We allknow the stress you've been under. I'm sure everyone understandsperfectly. <eos> <bos> TROI: Humans no longer own each other that way, Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: The tension on the ship is very high. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, you do need time. You cannot achieve complete recoveryso quickly. And it's perfectly normal, after what you've been through,to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again. <eos> <bos> TROI: We've all heard about you, and I felt certain things. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. Thetruth might be devastating to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> TROI: Look at him. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's lovely. I remember that sound, and all the good times wehad. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I suppose in a way it is. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are we being transformed into? <eos> <bos> TROI: Please, we're your friends. <eos> <bos> TROI: How many people were on that ship? <eos> <bos> TROI: The finalists will be here in half an hour. You have to pick afirst, second and third place, and four honourable mentions. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, not him. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! Don't! No! No! Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried aboutmaking mistakes, and they need some encouragement. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. You, the wolf, my father. It was though she were summoningall her defences to keep me away. But keep me away from what? What isshe protecting? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why have you kept it a secret? <eos> <bos> TROI: In a way, you're very lucky. You might have a chance do what mostpeople can only dream about. Have a second childhood without the painof growing up again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'd like to introduce you to thewinners of the primary school science fair. This is Marissa, JayGordon, and Patterson. They're here for their tour. <eos> <bos> TROI: That is not a problem. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. How big is a quantum filament? <eos> <bos> TROI: We wish you well, Mister Ramsey. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll say. Devinoni Ral. It's ridiculous, and wonderful. I feelcompletely out of control. Happy. Terrified. But there's nothingrational about this. <eos> <bos> TROI: Look at what he's carrying.

Seek outthe crystal that powers our flight. <eos> <bos> TROI: You couldn't wait? The Captain would have done it for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, are you sure? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, come on, sit down. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not getting much, Captain. A few words, disconnected phrases. I can feel his terror but I can't seem to get through to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: It looks like the Enterprise has been damaged. There, on the portnacelle. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's it like being an android? <eos> <bos> TROI: What is our engine status, Ensign? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not our help they want. <eos> <bos> TROI: The sun chasing an animal? <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. I'll tell the Captain. Well, I have to go. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: If any one of you defies the Tal Shiar, you will not bear thepunishment alone. Your families, all of them, will be there beside you. I am now Commander of this ship. You will take orders from me and noone else. Remove Commander Toreth from her station. If she resists,shoot her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Roga, tell them what you want. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think I know what she's doing. You have to fight to get herback, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, perhaps you over think things. <eos> <bos> TROI: The plague? <eos> <bos> TROI: The same. He's withdrawn. He's very frightened. All of his lifehe's been in control, and now for the first time he doesn't have anyanswers. The doctor gave him a complete medical examination. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm so sorry, Aaron. I wish I could do something to help. <eos> <bos> TROI: I doubt they see of you as an amateur. Not when it comes to TagusThree. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored yourdistress call but then you never acknowledged our response. <eos> <bos> TROI: By easing his pain. She's very confused byour resistance, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lower the force field. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you spell knife with a K. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's the perfect opportunity. The Enterprise is nearby. If we cancommunicate with them, they might be able to help us. <eos> <bos> TROI: How do you feel at this moment, as you lean over him to take thespecimen? <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand his frustration. We created himand we created her to be the woman he loves. Surely we have someresponsibility to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: It has troubled you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it. <eos> <bos> TROI: You wanted her to suffer. You have a great need. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's used to us, and we're used to him. It's like finding outsomeone you love has a terminal illness and <eos> <bos> TROI: Why are you here? <eos> <bos> TROI: So how much do you remember? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, she does. I'll contact Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him totransmit a copy as soon as possible. There may be some clues there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, stop it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Leave? You are going to die. No, you can't! Sickbay, this isCounsellor Troi, I need the Doctor in my quarters now! Ian! Ian, no. Ian. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why, Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd book my next vacation at your hotel, if you had one. <eos> <bos> TROI: It could be. We know so very little about them. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, but it's certainly unusual behaviour for Barclay. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you. Thank you for making me face my other half. <eos> <bos> TROI: My first appointment isn't for a few minutes. Why don't we talkfor a while? <eos> <bos> TROI: You think they're weak. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. Just waking up here. Why do I feel so frightened? What happened to me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where did he go? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain <eos> <bos> TROI: How do I know I won't be killed anyway? <eos> <bos> TROI: What we want is to get the dissidents to safety. Now answer thequestion. Is there a way? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, if I may recommend? With our attention on the Ferengivessel, we have ignored the planet. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think he's right, Captain. Look at the common themes playingout on the holodeck. A puzzle being put together, a foundation beinglaid, a paper doll being fashioned. They're all images of somethingbeing constructed. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was a terrible tragedy. The worst thing that can happen to anyparent. I know you feel responsible but it was an accident. And whatyou're doing isn't fair to Kestra. <eos> <bos> TROI: And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has anabnormally high need for achievement. Self image to him is a functionof what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too highcan kill to meet them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Just right. Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because I know how I'd feel if I was asked to replace Data at hisstation. <eos> <bos> TROI: I knew that was part of being in command and I thought I'dprepared for it, but when the moment came I hesitated. Maybe you wereright. Maybe I'm not cut out for this. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's put his entire self-worth on the line with this experiment. He is telling the truth when he says he'd rather die than leave. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you didn't like people. <eos> <bos> TROI: To be honest, he's testing even my limits. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our sensors do show some passages, sir. Perhaps you and I? <eos> <bos> TROI: I suggest working out an equitable system with the rules clearlyspelled out. For the child and the parent. You must make a list of yourresponsibilities, too. What would you like your father to promise,Alexander? <eos> <bos> TROI: Code Forty Seven. Captain's eyes only. <eos> <bos> TROI: The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archivethat seems bent on taking us over? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't wish that, Beverly. You can't be open to love if you don'trisk pain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, it's freezing in here. <eos> <bos> TROI: It doesn't feel right to leave while Beata is determined toexecute those people. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, I think Tasha's been infected too. <eos> <bos> TROI: We still have to learn how to live in the real world, Mother. Allof us. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's king of his particular hill, Commander. You'll have to treathim that way. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nearly fifteen hundred now, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: sleep occurs at a different frequency forBetazoids than other humanoids. I believe the beings are using thatfrequency to communicate telepathically. <eos> <bos> TROI: I got a little dizzy for a second. <eos> <bos> TROI: Angry. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. But I do keep reminding myself. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. You needn't worry about a thing. So, tell meeverything you know about Vertiform City. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Amanda, how are you feeling about all this now? It must beoverwhelming. <eos> <bos> TROI: Just tell me there's some chocolate here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you saying that you caused them to become individuals? <eos> <bos> TROI: What is it you're looking for? <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. Chief. I'll take you to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: She wants to take you away from me. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're the Captain, sir. You're entitled. <eos> <bos> TROI: That was going to be my question. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me, mother. Please. <eos> <bos> TROI: That terrifies you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, buttheirs continues to elude us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's not guess what might have been. I love my work aboard theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can I see a police record on Roga Danar? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're alive! You're all right! <eos> <bos> TROI: What is it you want from him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Meet me in Transporter room three at nineteen hundredhours. It's important. <eos> <bos> TROI: You were honest with him, Mother. You had to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can we tighten the pattern further? <eos> <bos> TROI: Would you and Isabella like to come for a walk with me? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to put it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you open it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I'm here, Data. Geordi said you wanted to see us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Am I interrupting? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's time to go, sweetheart. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ha! <eos> <bos> TROI: No! No! <eos> <bos> TROI: I do it to help my crew, not outmanoeuvre them. And I don't hidethat I'm an empath. <eos> <bos> TROI: The creature is filled with rage. Undirected, unfocused rage. When he confronts it, his guard goes down because he's feeling itinstead of suppressing it. Acknowledging his needs makes himvulnerable. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: That cargo is the property of the Tal Shiar. You will not touchit. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? Because I'm not the most technically-minded person on theship? I may have trouble telling the difference between a plasmaconduit and a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officerthan memorising technical manuals. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hit? I'm sorry, but anything could be important. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's very hard to accomplish. <eos> <bos> TROI: Remove her weapon. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, perhaps if we understood your thinking, if you couldexplain <eos> <bos> TROI: We deal with our pain in many different ways, but over the yearsI've discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individualis revealed. If I can help a person back to a state of joy, well, myrole has its rewards. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. Come in for a drink? <eos> <bos> TROI: What do your feelings tell you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Excuse me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, the situation down there has changed. <eos> <bos> TROI: And painful. Early diagnosis and special training did help Tamadjust, but he has some problems. <eos> <bos> TROI: Isabella would you like some too? <eos> <bos> TROI: I never fully appreciated how difficult and how rewarding it isto be human, but I had a lot of help. Thanks. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm glad you stopped by. <eos> <bos> TROI: We will take them with us and see that they were reunited withtheir families. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, make this a metal table. <eos> <bos> TROI: This must be very strange for you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think what we've gained far outweighs anything that might havebeen lost. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly hoped that meeting him like this might make an impact. Help you remember. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why, is he coming along? <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander, if Mister Conor doesn't mind, I'd like to stay and seemore of his colony. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander Riker. It is inappropriate for you to lead the awayteam. Until the return of Captain Picard, you are in command of theEnterprise. We're in a state of war, and your place is on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's getting much, much colder, sir. How far down is it likely togo? <eos> <bos> TROI: But that's what's so odd. It wasn't tense at all. In fact, Isensed no tension from you or Goss. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is anything wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Wes, your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk toJeremy. Why is that? <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, I doubt that. <eos> <bos> TROI: It might be that, I don't know. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm still here. I haven't gone anywhere. Do you remember anything more? <eos> <bos> TROI: What about your Chorus? <eos> <bos> TROI: Or more. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're not Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir. According to the Ligon Code of Honour, Lutan has done whathe set out to do, achieve recognition for being daring and bold. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, have you been in my quarters? <eos> <bos> TROI: Everything. Every time I think about this war, our mission, Ifeel a sense of panic like a hand's closing around my throat. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I do. Only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to mymind's wishes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Give Clara a chance. As she learns to make friends on theEnterprise, you'll probably find that she'll leave her imaginary worldbehind. Captain's log, stardate 45852.1. The Enterprise hasarrived at four seven, a nebula which has formed around a neutronstar. We are eager to investigate this unique formation. <eos> <bos> TROI: You seem so strong in your support. I'm curious. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? Does the thought of my having contact with them make youuneasy? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations, and whenthey're done I'm going to reward myself with two ice cream sundaes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why don't you ask Maques to do it? <eos> <bos> TROI: To the planet? <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I know the best thing to do is to gradually wean her awayfrom her fantasy, and she did make some new friends today and had agood time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Nara, may I ask you something? The work LieutenantKwan was doing, was it unusual in any way? <eos> <bos> TROI: After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home. <eos> <bos> TROI: Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain? Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: I sensed nothing unusual last night. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you go in and get her back? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that all, Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now thanever. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there are eleven thousand inhabitants in this colony. Atthis range, I should be sensing something. I'm not. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's difficult to explain. I feel there's something differentabout these two people. I'm sorry. I can't be clearer than that. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, not at all. But I believe that she's been thinking about you. Do you know why? <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand. I should have realised. Humans, young human malesparticularly, have difficulty separating platonic love and physicallove. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wish I could. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, what are you doing here? You can't just stroll on to theBridge whenever you feel like it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I get some hot chocolate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor, why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact thatthe exocomp could be alive? After all, you're talking to a livingmachine right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Klingon exercises, actually. Lieutenant Worf teaches a class. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Tam is a telepath of extraordinary talent,even for a Betazoid. He's a specialist in first contact with new lifeforms. <eos> <bos> TROI: We see and hear you now. We didn't know you were there. You arebeautiful to us. All life is beautiful. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! Let them go or you will all die. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor ! <eos> <bos> TROI: The thanks should go to N'Vek. He sacrificed himself to savethem, and me. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's alright. I'm getting used to it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come by my quarters and I'll show it to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Since his records show no previous mention of that, the fact thatit's happened now could be important. But all I sense from him isconfusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then I won't use telepathy. We'll work verbally. <eos> <bos> TROI: Isn't Barkon Four inhabited? <eos> <bos> TROI: But I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the PrimeDirective. True, they are not actual allies, but <eos> <bos> TROI: Something's very wrong, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: But I feel perfectly fine otherwise. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've got it. From all of us. We don't need any more convincing. Please, obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. <eos> <bos> TROI: We are. <eos> <bos> TROI: Was he prone to mood swings or depression? <eos> <bos> TROI: I've got some things to take care of. <eos> <bos> TROI: We've been trying to wake you up for the last five minutes. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wonder if I shouldn't warn him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Eighteen people lost their lives. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you know how to deactivate this? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why did you stop me? Someone needs to set her straight! <eos> <bos> TROI: Passionate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't believe this, Will. None of it's real. You're still with uson the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not a thing. I was empathically aware of you right up to themoment you froze, and then it all stopped. The past few dayshave been exhausting. Maybe it was my imagination. There were momentsin that lecture hall when I thought time was standing still there, too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Those you can see in the mirror. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you tell us what it is? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, they apply to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? What's going on? What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Which aspects are you referring to? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're up to something. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's right, Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Someone close at hand and yet unattainable. I can do anything foryou, Captain. Anything you could ever imagine. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're feeling profoundly sad. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you feeling sad? <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't seem to be the kind of man to give up so easily. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Mother <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, all I'm sensing from you is anger and hatred. Have you feltany other emotions? <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, emergency procedure. Eject antimatter storage unitthree. Authorisation, Troi omega omega three one. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg, you were faced with a difficult transport. Anyone would havebeen apprehensive in that situation. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can I share something important with you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you. You tend tosuppress them. There are a few hours until we arrive. Perhaps youshould use this time to analyse your feelings and put them intoperspective. <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! <eos> <bos> TROI: They didn't take everything away. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's getting weaker, isn't he? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos> <bos> TROI: But you might need me if you have to negotiate with Taris again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Who's Hedril, mother? Why is she here? Is Hedril me when I was alittle girl? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, he doesn't understand you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe she can protect herself. After all, she has a great deal ofpower. <eos> <bos> TROI: She has decided to focus all of her sexual energy on one male,who will, of course, eventually become her husband. It seems, Captain,that you are the early favourite. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wesley. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think we should. I'll see you in the morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, I find it strange that none of our visitors feels muchremorse about the two freighter passengers who perished. Yet thatbarrel of cargo is a source of great anxiety to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can imagine. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: I have felt no pain. <eos> <bos> TROI: My God. <eos> <bos> TROI: Fine. It was good to see some old friends. I'd lost touch withmost of them. It's interesting to see the different paths some of theirlives have taken. Beverly, you don't usually stand a watch on theBridge even when Data's not here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our presence in the Neutral Zone is provocative. It could forceher to respond. <eos> <bos> TROI: Visionaries who don't see this planet as it is, but as it willbe. <eos> <bos> TROI: A little shaken but all right. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, let's assumefor a second you're right, that things did happen as you remember them. Are you saying that everyone's memory on this ship has been altered butyours? <eos> <bos> TROI: How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? <eos> <bos> TROI: Can I have a glass of water? It's so cold inhere. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm no longer Imzadi to you? <eos> <bos> TROI: How long has it been since your last diplomatic contact? <eos> <bos> TROI: Only what you tell me. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain. Yhatyou're fighting something. What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Eyes in the dark. That's what the voice said in my dream. Is thatwhere you heard it? In a dream? Over and over? Beverly, I know what itis. I know what's happening. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, that's bound to cause a dream or two. So, shall we startgoing over the personnel reports? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: If only I could go back to the control room without beingoverwhelmed by the experience. It might help me remember some detailthat might be relevant. <eos> <bos> TROI: The ship was protecting itself again. Stopping us frominterfering. Whatever it's doing it intends to continue. <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand. The idea of raising a child can seem a tremendousburden, particularly to a solitary parent. <eos> <bos> TROI: If the aliens have been killing people there, well, someone mighthave noticed something unusual. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor Stubbs, I know how much this means to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly <eos> <bos> TROI: Why not? You've eliminated all the technical explanations. And itmakes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex, more human,that you might experience the same kind of psychological complexitiesas a human. <eos> <bos> TROI: You cannot apply human style logic to this, Captain. A Betazoidwoman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful, should youspurn any such advances. She would take it personally. <eos> <bos> TROI: Kestra was here a few moments ago. Talk to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Captain, it's just a rare pleasure to meet this sideof your personality. <eos> <bos> TROI: I did not ruin anything. We've became very good friends. <eos> <bos> TROI: As you can see, there are three other planets in this sector thathave environmental conditions similar to those here on Dorvan Five. They're all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's that? <eos> <bos> TROI: The Romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface. <eos> <bos> TROI: That was a beautiful. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's Will Riker. That's right. I was thinking of him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our apologies. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is wrong. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Conor and I have had a relationship. <eos> <bos> TROI: You want to leave. Why can't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: All your friends on board do. <eos> <bos> TROI: This might sound crazy, but for a moment I thought I was stuck inthat wall. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've never felt anything like it. It was asthough they were calling to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why don't you go with him, Worf? We'll see what we can do here. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! No! No! Don't! <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, don't worry about it. Geordi explained everything to me. Itwasn't your fault. But somehow I thought turnabout would be fair play,so I made us a little something to snack on. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you know of any reason why he might do that? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: And obviously you do. <eos> <bos> TROI: If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. And you might be surprised at just how good you can be. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Data. I don't seem to be much help without my empathicabilities. I just don't know how to draw on my human instinct. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, I think it's time you tell me about this mysteriousmarriage to a man you've never met. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's correct. For instance, we know that Darmok was a greathero, a hunter, and that Tanagra was an island, but that's it. Withoutthe details, there's no understanding. <eos> <bos> TROI: Several thousand? <eos> <bos> TROI: Everyone has tempers. <eos> <bos> TROI: I do. He was at the university on Betazed when I studiedpsychology there. <eos> <bos> TROI: If there are no medical objections? <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened to Amanda's parents? Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, don't start. <eos> <bos> TROI: Aaron, you acted in the best interests of your people. There wasno way to avoid what happened. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lotalike. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you aren't up to it then you don't deserve to be here. Isn'tthat right? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I know you and he have had some problems. <eos> <bos> TROI: Voices? What do they say? <eos> <bos> TROI: The new night duty officer? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos> <bos> TROI: You were always welcome. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was so awful to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: You will keep me informed of our progress. <eos> <bos> TROI: You are a most unusual species. Worthy of a second chance. Proceed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Security override, authorisation Troi Delta two nine. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Look at what we have so far. Evidence that these aliens have beentravelling back in time to Earth. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is it responding to us? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think you need an empath to sense that woman's feelings. There's hostility that she seems to have transferred from Lore to Data. Perhaps you shouldn't have forced them together so soon. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know if this means anything, but I seem to have anability that the others don't. I have a very strong sense of what otherpeople are feeling at times it's almost <eos> <bos> TROI: Does this have something to do with Captain Picard? <eos> <bos> TROI: There was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stagein front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress. <eos> <bos> TROI: He wished he could have been here when you got back from shoreleave. You should have seen him, Worf. He stayed up all night talkingabout how proud he was of his father. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. There were literally thousands of people involved in buildingthe Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know you do. Just take that memory and put it aside for amoment, and tell meeverything you remember about the shuttlecraft trip after you left theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sounds delicious. <eos> <bos> TROI: In two or three weeks, nanites may be all that's left of theFederation. <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good question. Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, you'll work verbally too. The point is for you to get somerest, mother. Besides, it'll do them good to have to figure things outwith words. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are we going now? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. I feel it too, but don't you worry. <eos> <bos> TROI: How well do you remember your mother? <eos> <bos> TROI: Pain. Such pain! Pain! <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mmm-hmmm. Devinoni Ral. Who are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's nothing these people have done. I'm certain of that. Theirminds are so open. <eos> <bos> TROI: Health and safety inspections? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is it really so complicated? <eos> <bos> TROI: What? What? <eos> <bos> TROI: All our technology and experience, our universal translator, ouryears in space, contacts with more alien cultures than I can evenremember. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotionalfitness of the crew. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, you do understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: I find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough toput my mind off most frustrations. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree toit. <eos> <bos> TROI: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a longtime ago? <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh? What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no reason to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month,talking with Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll make sure he reaches your parents' home safely. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am. <eos> <bos> TROI: My mother's so diligent about her journal. why would she havestopped making entries for so long? <eos> <bos> TROI: Purple omelettes? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sense nothing but good intentions from them, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Right. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe it died. It has been a few years. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. I think it would. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: You mean he never knew he hadn't left the holodeck? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think so. My mother never mentioned her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Something like that. Oh, Beverly. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, I didn't see you there. You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm going to head back to the ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. Something <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodbye. <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't know it was possible for a human anda Klingon to produce a child. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, we're among non-telepaths. It's impolite not to speakaloud. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, Bill was concerned that you might be upset that I caredeeply for him, too. <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand, but let go of it. You're here now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Everything I've read suggests that he was well-adjusted andoptimistic. It just doesn't make any sense. Can I get you anything? <eos> <bos> TROI: Isn't it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Chocolate is a serious thing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thanks for waiting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, it's all right. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor? <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodnight. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Bridge. He can hear you. Captain's log, supplemental. Following an abortedattempt to take control of the Bridge, Counsellor Troi, Mister Data,and Chief O'Brien have seized Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> TROI: I suppose that's true. <eos> <bos> TROI: Live with it. Computer, execute my original command. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where's the Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ensign. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm glad you think so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Everyone was talking today about the way you absorbed theCaldonian bid. <eos> <bos> TROI: They certainly are. <eos> <bos> TROI: But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is asupervisory position, I'd go with her. <eos> <bos> TROI: A little. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me one thing. Is there a solution? Or is this simply a testof my ability to handle a no-win situation? <eos> <bos> TROI: She's right. It is important that you be able to make the claytake the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to beconcentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on thefeelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what doyou think about when you see a bird? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, it's not. It's him. It's Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want to make you more comfortable. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really enjoyed the scene you just performed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Good morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: His feelings towards you are very warm. He's attracted to you inmany ways. <eos> <bos> TROI: I agree, but she does have the right to make that choice, even ifwe don't feel it's a good one. <eos> <bos> TROI: So what else has your research uncovered about William Riker? <eos> <bos> TROI: Not sure of yourself? <eos> <bos> TROI: I just want to take a quick look. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, suddenly I'm sensing something else. Satisfaction. Enormous satisfaction. <eos> <bos> TROI: Right now, I feel as two-dimensional as our friends out there. Inthe universe but barely aware of it. Just trying to survive oninstinct. Data, what if they're simply acting instinctively? There areinherent, inborn forces in every species. What they need, what theyfear. We have to discover what drives this species. <eos> <bos> TROI: Among other things, his relationship with his father. No moreholodeck, Mother. Please. And why aren't you all absorbed in yourwedding plans? It's only three days away. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: You were waiting for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: You can. We can. <eos> <bos> TROI: I always thought this room could use a little more colour. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's okay. Close your eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Or the emotions that they produce. <eos> <bos> TROI: The ophidian the aliens were carrying. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will come onto your ship. Please, lower yourshields and prepare to beam me aboard. <eos> <bos> TROI: Those stairs are where we entered down here, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our captain needs a vacation. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe we could do something to help Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, if you'll excuse me, I have the Bridge this watch. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually no, it's more like they're not what they say they are. <eos> <bos> TROI: The board shows green, Captain. All go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: He was left here. Abandoned. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I'm fine, thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Little One? You called me that when I was five. Now stopdemeaning me and address me as an adult! <eos> <bos> TROI: Leadership grows from self-confidence, which is also part of aStarfleet officer's education. <eos> <bos> TROI: The other day, when I told you about how Commander Riker and Ididn't meet on Risa, what I didn't say was how disappointed I was. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leavinghim on Earth would not have protected him. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's impossible. He's been in prison. <eos> <bos> TROI: We can't track down any element that might be responsible. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know this much. We are unimportant to it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If wetry to avoid that pain, we can make it harder on ourselves in the longrun. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is this Tagus Three? <eos> <bos> TROI: If Isabella is making you do things you know are wrong, then youmust tell her it's not acceptable. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, please, don't do this to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you might like some company, if you're not too busy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Standing by. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hedril, I asked your father to bring you herebecause I wanted to talk to you about something. You know thatLwaxana's sick, don't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: We had business dealings. He owes me money. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you have a point to make, Commander? If so, it has escaped me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Once before you said double. What didyou mean? What is double? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's no use, Captain. He can't answer you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm on my way. Let me know if you find anything. <eos> <bos> TROI: I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I sensed that allwere not concerned for the same reason. Undoubtedly there are survivorsfrom the Odin on this planet. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello. Pleased to meet you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, show me a rectangular conference table. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know this is difficult for you. Is thereanything I can do to make you more comfortable? <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly! <eos> <bos> TROI: By the way. The next time you call me aristocratic. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I wish I had a good answer for you. Perhaps when they're ready, they will. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll see you later, Mother. Excuse me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: You. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said there was no way to stabilise the containment field fromthe Bridge. Could it be done from Engineering? <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm absolutely lost. You have to dosomething. <eos> <bos> TROI: They need you on the Bridge, now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why not ask his wife if she'd like to attend? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: Step back, now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Excuse me? <eos> <bos> TROI: The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel? Timothy, listen to me. The damage to your ship might have occurred atthe same time your arm touched the panel, but it was only acoincidence. This wasn't your fault. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there something we can do to help? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I certainly wouldn't wish to throw off your entire balance. <eos> <bos> TROI: He desperately wants to leave this ship. Captain's log, supplemental. We continue on courseto Endicor. We are now less than two hours away from our rendezvouswith ourselves. <eos> <bos> TROI: What if they've chosen a course to the cosmic string? A case ofpure stimulus response, driven by instinct, just like the moth to aflame. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I am only halfBetazoid. My father was a Starfleet officer. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jeremy, it's time for this to end. It's notreal and it's over now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, of course she is. I have no wish to harm her or to harmanyone else. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then if some types of endorphins attract them <eos> <bos> TROI: Your cowardice does not befit a Romulan soldier. <eos> <bos> TROI: Like what? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, it's just not the same. Have you ever been for a realmoonlight swim? <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing else since? <eos> <bos> TROI: I hope I see you soon. Maybe we can be friends. <eos> <bos> TROI: Brull's ready to negotiate. He just wants privacy so that hewon't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. <eos> <bos> TROI: Betazoid blood is also practical, Captain. The odds are very goodshe'd defeat Lutan's wife easily and you would win all the bargainingpoints you need. <eos> <bos> TROI: It wasn't your fault. Please. My mother misled you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. When I was in the nacelle room I had an empathicexperience. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. They have the energy and drive, and the clones possess theemotional maturity and the technological knowledge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you should be careful. This isn'tjust some experiment you're running, Data. Jenna is a living, breathingperson with needs and feelings that have to be considered. <eos> <bos> TROI: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is fivehundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. Theyconsider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexityto avoid any future misunderstandings. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: So you're no longer a human? <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, I can't read Ullians, but I do know a certain Betazoid motherwho is a great deal like your father. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you're feeling a certain confusion about this mission. <eos> <bos> TROI: I agree, entirely. Mister Ral asked me not to tell anyone he hasempathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in anegotiation. And yes, it did put me in a conflict of interest, which Ihope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral has used your fear ofcontinuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies toundermine our position. I also believe that this incident was staged byRal and Goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of theChrysalians. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. It happened several years ago and it's well behindboth of us now. I just thought you should know. <eos> <bos> TROI: You could have easily been right. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I'm just not sure she wants to escape. It's the only way oflife she's ever known. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then it's possible they may have changed over the years. <eos> <bos> TROI: We will be cloaked. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I make a suggestion? <eos> <bos> TROI: If you can ask the question, I'd say no. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't like good-byes. How about, until next time? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're a very entertaining patient. <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck thirty two. Clara, do you want me totalk to Isabella? <eos> <bos> TROI: In a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively. <eos> <bos> TROI: Strength comes from love. <eos> <bos> TROI: An end to grief. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander. Those aliens. What they feel is not helplessness. Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger, great danger. <eos> <bos> TROI: My first duty is to the ship. The ship! <eos> <bos> TROI: It's Geordi. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell me. Whatever it is. we can face it together. <eos> <bos> TROI: When Professor Manheim's name was mentioned, you reacted withintense emotion. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother? <eos> <bos> TROI: Why are you doing this? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all right. They're home. We were wrong. The cosmic string itwas never dangerous to them. It was the one place in the galaxy theymost wanted to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but sixteen years. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly, you're in love. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: We alarm him for some reason. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job? <eos> <bos> TROI: But you always say you like surprises, Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly? We've contacted the nearest Starbase for a searchvessel. I'm afraid the closest one is almost a week away. <eos> <bos> TROI: Have you dreamt about scissors recently? <eos> <bos> TROI: She called out to me. She does want me to help. <eos> <bos> TROI: There is limited information, but I will prepare something. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. What happened to you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Orton is not as calm as he looks. He's very agitated and nervous,as if something's gone wrong. <eos> <bos> TROI: All right. Switch the EM power inverter to the lateral. No, wait. Use the neodyne relay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Need? <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. Let me help you relax. <eos> <bos> TROI: Night Bird! <eos> <bos> TROI: It was like this for you and Jack? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: No! <eos> <bos> TROI: We are visitors. We've come to trade our cloth. May we speak? <eos> <bos> TROI: If we have established that the Romulans were not responsible forthe destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent to withdraw? <eos> <bos> TROI: I suddenly became dizzy. I'd think I'd better go to my quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you recall if anything unusual happened there? <eos> <bos> TROI: You may wait outside. Make certain we're not disturbed. <eos> <bos> TROI: We can't delay much longer. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly, this is important. What were you thinking when you hitWes? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hot chocolate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: Tam? <eos> <bos> TROI: Activate forward disruptor array. Fire when ready. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why can't you do that? Why can't you turn your disadvantage intoan advantage? <eos> <bos> TROI: We'll just go and get a treat, and then <eos> <bos> TROI: Clara, would you like some clay of your own? <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't mean right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't want to interfere with your personal life, but unresolvedstrong emotion can affect judgement. <eos> <bos> TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's headed toward the caves. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. <eos> <bos> TROI: I remember. <eos> <bos> TROI: But why is this happening? What does the archive hope toaccomplish? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's as if I were to say to you, Juliet on her balcony. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Beverly and I have been getting unusual reports. Peoplebehaving strangely, others hearing sounds that aren't there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it? <eos> <bos> TROI: So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if theCaptain led this away party. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for thisone. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why are you here? How did you know? <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's see if we can find out. Computer, this is Counsellor Troi. Request personal history on. What are their names? <eos> <bos> TROI: Groppler Zorn, sir. A great fear just ahead. <eos> <bos> TROI: I already have a job as Counsellor. If you want to know what happens to Arridor and Kolin the Delta Quadrant, here is thetale. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

They're all very interesting. Do you have afavourite? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't worry she'll be fine. This is something I think you'll findinteresting. It's a jewel plant from Folnar Three. The plant secretes aresin which is collected within the blossom. By the time the bloom hasfaded, the resin has hardened into a rare and beautiful gem. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then the flow of negative emotions and feelings were reversedback to him somehow. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is real Bajoran foraiga. <eos> <bos> TROI: How did you know? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's intelligent, thoughtful, typically Angosian. I know whathe's done, but when I'm with him I cannot believe he is randomly anddeliberately violent. in fact, inherently, he has a non-violentpersonality. <eos> <bos> TROI: Imzadi. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really thought you'd tell me you were an artist. I just feltyour mind very much on these. They are your work, aren't they? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's also possible that they just want to talk to us. I think weshould respond. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alkar, is there anything I can do? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you for the encouragement. <eos> <bos> TROI: As you know, there is very little availableon the Romulans. <eos> <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know what the worst part of this is? And I've seen it happento so many patients. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't dislike you, Professor. <eos> <bos> TROI: He must have thought you would have wanted it. <eos> <bos> TROI: It would take time. One of your days. He is immune to ourinfluence. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's just hope, Beverly. Not false hope. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's a story the Doctor will tell you. <eos> <bos> TROI: You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences areunique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learnfrom the experience. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. you're making quite an effort to be cheerful. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you remember when the Enterprise hit that quantum filament andI was in command on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's in it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Uh un. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there areresidual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violentlyby the Borg. Kidnapped, assaulted,mutilated. <eos> <bos> TROI: This was delivered for you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. He's my friend. That means you are, too. I promise I won'thurt you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually I wanted to ask your opinion about something. I've beenthinking about taking the Bridge Officer's test and becoming a fullCommander. <eos> <bos> TROI: He can't, Mother. He has his orders. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm very worried about his behaviour and what I've just hearddoesn't make me feel any better. Data, you're the onlyone he's reached out to, because you rescued him. We can use yourrelationship with him to help his recovery. <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't want to frighten you. She has opted for the onlydignified option open to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now I know why you wore that dress. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will we? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's up to him, and he's stopped cooperating. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: They'll need to speak to you as well, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: And will you provide for his education, his health, his growth, acareer, a wife? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd love to. <eos> <bos> TROI: We can speculate on the available evidence. <eos> <bos> TROI: So many minds on this ship, all free. Released, <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Data. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know, but something terrible happened in there. I feltit. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean, quantum realities? <eos> <bos> TROI: You must save him. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you tried to keep that knowledge from us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but she never lets up. <eos> <bos> TROI: Daddy? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's not what I asked. <eos> <bos> TROI: Never. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: Cancel them. Cancel everything till after lunch. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I think there's been a slight miscommunication. Did youwant to meet with Gul Lemec in here? <eos> <bos> TROI: He didn't show up for his appointment. I assumed he must still behere. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your last valet tried so hard to rid me of it. Whatever happenedto Mister Xelo? <eos> <bos> TROI: Our stun field had no effect on him. He remained conscious whilewe tried to take over the ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe so. Like a thought, but rather mechanical in nature. <eos> <bos> TROI: Really? <eos> <bos> TROI: As a Starfleet Security Officer, she may have represented hisriskiest prize. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your plan has failed. This ship must be destroyed. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's good you don't feel set back. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alex. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard has every right to be curious. <eos> <bos> TROI: Give everyone something to do, somewhere to focus theirattention. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wanted to see how he was doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's it, sir. It's just one alien that I'm sensing here. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I prefer a mode of transportation that doesn't have a mind ofits own. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. I'd like you to talk to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ian said he's the reason the ship is in danger. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard talks to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure I looked terrible with my eyes all red and swollen fromcrying. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, it really is quite late. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. An animal is always at its best when hunted. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's still in shock. it's hard to know what's going on in hismind right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, if Jeremiah is returned to his family in his presentcondition, it would be a wrenching experience for everyone. Especiallyfor him. He needs to re-discover his identity, make some connectionwith his roots. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, don't. <eos> <bos> TROI: Which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all right. Have you considered the possibility that this wasjust a dream? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hasn't that been the problem all along? Throughout your careeryou've had lofty goals, but you've never been willing to do what'snecessary to attain them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Imzadi, we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Darmok. Well, it seems to be a point of contention between them. Perhaps something the Tamarian captain proposed that the First Officerdidn't like. <eos> <bos> TROI: He feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there. Ifhe's right it may mean that she's suffered some kind of trauma that hermetaconscious just can't tolerate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mrs. Carmichael. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've seen another one, like Palmer. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hang on, Will. Hang on. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, belay that order. <eos> <bos> TROI: We come from a federation of planets. Captain Picard is from aplanet called Earth, which is over two thousand light years from here. I'm from another planet called Betazed. <eos> <bos> TROI: We were orbiting Angosia when you escaped from Lunar Five. <eos> <bos> TROI: Bill, more than anything else in the world, anything, you want tobe a starship captain. True? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're empathic? <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect to findanyone up except Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe I should go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Similar. It's only at mid-life that a Betazed female becomes,well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean. <eos> <bos> TROI: We certainly have. <eos> <bos> TROI: You always say that. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's true. He still cares for you, despite the physical changeshe's undergoing. <eos> <bos> TROI: The facts are the Ferengis did fire at us, but we were chasingthem. Since then, all they've done is searched our computers, trying tolearn who and what we are. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. Have you foundanything? <eos> <bos> TROI: The Sacred Chalice of Rixx is an old clay pot with mold growinginside it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I am, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: If our positions were reversed, I wouldn't have been in heretreating skinned elbows while you were lying passed out on your officefloor. I'd have been there a lot sooner. Perhaps in time to preventthis from ever happening! <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: You've been glowing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as LieutenantKwan? <eos> <bos> TROI: I know things must look very strange to you, but everything'sgoing to be all right. No one's going to hurt you. We're friends ofNikolai and Worf. Don't be afraid. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you serious? <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, continue the programme. <eos> <bos> TROI: With all due respect, Captain, you don't know what you're talkingabout. That is a common belief with no scientific basis, no doubtcreated by normal people who felt uncomfortable around the disabled. Iam disabled, and I'm telling you I cannot perform my duties. <eos> <bos> TROI: I really have to finish this. I have some appointments thisafternoon. <eos> <bos> TROI: My God, you've been shot! Computer, end programme. Troi toCaptain Picard. Troi to Security. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you afraid of what it might say? <eos> <bos> TROI: We will each take a hostage for protection. <eos> <bos> TROI: But I can't help feeling that I'm taking something from her. Something precious. A part of her childhood she'll never have again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hannah, let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Whydon't we go for a walk? <eos> <bos> TROI: I knew you'd encourage me. <eos> <bos> TROI: The paracortex is the Betazoid telepathic lobe. She communicatedwith Maques telepathically just before she fell. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do what you feel is necessary. In the meantime, we must protectourselves. Engage the cloaking device. <eos> <bos> TROI: My mother bought our freedom, Captain. She doesn't want to staywith Tog. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't be sure. The emotions of the crew are particularly strongright now. It's difficult to filter them out. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, that and the table. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an importantclue. <eos> <bos> TROI: If I don't find him, I'm going to have to move on. Are you sureyou haven't seen him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, we have to talk. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there's been a great deal of damage to our computersystem. Maybe we're not getting the correct information. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, you know what they say, Mister Worf. Hell hath no fury likea woman scorned. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Computer show me a table. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ensign Calloway. That doesn't sound like a man who's planning ontaking his own life. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm afraid so, Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, if it's a distress call, I think they'd be asking for whatthey need, not what they already have. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know how much the Professor meant to you and how much you wantto find out what happened, but staring at these numbers isn't going tobring him back. The conference on Atalia Seven has been scheduled forsix months. Starfleet is relying on your mediation efforts to <eos> <bos> TROI: Wouldn't you rather be alone with me? With me in your mind? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's more than that. I'm been sensing very erratic emotions fromher. Even the clothes she's wearing are unusual. They're so subdued. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's understandable, sir. Sharing an orbit with God is no smallexperience. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wonderful! Wonderful. <eos> <bos> TROI: His fear is escalating. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your single-mindedness, your need to have this experiment work. <eos> <bos> TROI: In class. I've alerted the teacher to expect us. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's so loud! It's getting louder! Please, I can't stand it. Makeit stop! <eos> <bos> TROI: At least this way, he'll be alive in the other time frame. Wemight have a chance to save him later. Is the Romulan still alive? <eos> <bos> TROI: She's not a ghost. She's here right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's a general feeling of disorientation on board, but nothingserious as far as I can tell. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, I told you it's not my decision. Your father doesn't want to <eos> <bos> TROI: The temporary presence of these humans should not interfere withyour plans. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're not. I was just leaving. Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: We might be able to run time back to a point before the warp corebreach occurred and then find a way to prevent the power transfer. Andthen when time goes forward <eos> <bos> TROI: How could that happen? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's overwhelming to have so much of your life missing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, Ensign. Proceed. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: I feel the same about being here. I'm something of a student ofhuman nature, and I find this all fascinating. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know that. Geordi, could you repair the conduit? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Could I? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, humans sometimes find it helpful to have an outsider setthe standard by which they're judged. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I don't know what to do. <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll be sure to tell her you said so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Time well spent. <eos> <bos> TROI: That will bring them here in just minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's in neural shock, <eos> <bos> TROI: Has something happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: You only ask to torment me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please, don't hurt me, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Go ahead, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. What he wants most is to captain a starship. <eos> <bos> TROI: You were really surprised they came back. <eos> <bos> TROI: You want me to raise Alexander? <eos> <bos> TROI: What about our children? <eos> <bos> TROI: Tasha! <eos> <bos> TROI: You would like my opinion about you and Commander Daren. <eos> <bos> TROI: Here. There. <eos> <bos> TROI: It all seemed so real to me. I can't believe that everything Iexperienced happened in just those few seconds. <eos> <bos> TROI: Strange, isn't it? You'll travel light years, dodge asteroidstorms, brave hostile aliens, and yet when asked to assume a parentalrole, you cringe. Why do you suppose that is? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, when I'm ready for bed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Coward. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wish I knew how to help, Captain, but under the circumstances <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, when that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was overI realised that a part of me missed it. Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I feltlike I was exploring a whole new side of myself. Not that I want togive up counselling by any means, but I really would like to stretchmyself a little. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, maybe he's just tired of hearing you complain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Listen to yourself. A few days ago you wouldn't even talk to us. This is my fault. I'm so sorry. <eos> <bos> TROI: Run programme. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain is well aware of the gravity of the situation,Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. Hello, Worf. <eos> <bos> TROI: I remember. Where did you get this? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Not specifically, but there are two things that seem unusual. Thebartender is an artificial lifeform. <eos> <bos> TROI: Were you hear all along? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that so? <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jeremy, I know your mother loved you very much. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies onLigon. <eos> <bos> TROI: How did this happen? <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, this is my mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's not easy having an overbearing parent. Believe me, I knowhow you feel. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. It's like he's trying to confuse us, misdirect ussomehow. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander? Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship? <eos> <bos> TROI: I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it. Perhapsbecause I've had the opportunity to spend more time with her and get toknow her better. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's been taken. <eos> <bos> TROI: We did our best to prepare him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure the health and safety inspectionwon't last much longer. And in the meantime, I'm really glad that wehave this opportunity to get to know you. May I ask what businessyou're in? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's Tarmin. It's your father. Captain's log, stardate 45433.2. We have set acourse for Starbase four forty, where the Ullians will disembark andreturn home. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: You have an imaginary friend? <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> TROI: All right. <eos> <bos> TROI: I, too, would never say goodbye, Imzadi. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm going for a walk in the arboretum. I wouldn't mindsome company. <eos> <bos> TROI: You saved them, Will, you and the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's like it belongs to someone else. Nothing feels right. Thisroom, this ship, most of all this war we're fighting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ambassador, I'm curious. Now does your species procreate? <eos> <bos> TROI: That was a long time ago. Many things have changed, includingTomalak. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, increase ambient temperature by two degrees Centigradeand increase relative humidity by ten percent. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one ofmy father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turnedup. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know it sounds unusual, but it is understandable. Technically,it's called enantiodromia. Conversion intothe opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotionalto being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He'sjust found a new way to suppress it. <eos> <bos> TROI: On a straight line to the cosmic string. You're convinced thestring's gravitation is pulling them in? <eos> <bos> TROI: Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness,serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that youhope to draw out in others. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, no, I'm fine. It's just I feel before we continue it'simportant you know that. Okay? <eos> <bos> TROI: Are we children to you now? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd be happy to. But first, I'd like to talk about how the changein command is affecting the crew. <eos> <bos> TROI: Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel mainly friendship, and happiness. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Barclay, you're exhausted and highly agitated, and Icannot allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others. Ithink <eos> <bos> TROI: You are not fit to command. Step down. Step down or I will haveyou removed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did the table do something wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's impossible. The Romulans use an artificial quantumsingularity as their power source. Once it's activated, it can't beshut down. <eos> <bos> TROI: You made this? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Very well, Lieutenant. Hot chocolate. <eos> <bos> TROI: You will plot a course for the Draken System. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain is waiting for you inside. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard Day is one of the children's favourite schoolactivities. They look forward to it all year. <eos> <bos> TROI: What stage is it in? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are you? I have to find you. I have to tell you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've grown so accustomed to it, I forget it's there. <eos> <bos> TROI: My mother is beginning a physiological phase. It's one that allBetazoid women must deal with as they enter mid-life. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would imagine that your self-disciplinehelps you in your work. <eos> <bos> TROI: There are over a thousand lifeforms on this vessel. How could youassure their silence? <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain does seem detached from his emotions. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: And that was disturbing to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Two minutes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain? Excuse me. <eos> <bos> TROI: They illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here. Thenthey asked you to keep secrets from your superiors. Effectively, todisobey Starfleet regulations. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think I can do anything, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, please. <eos> <bos> TROI: For several years. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please, sit down. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll bet Isabella is very pretty. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not that I recall. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you must have one, I'm sure we can replicate it for you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Absolutely not. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure it is safe, otherwise it would not have been loaded. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're lying. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has focusedits attention entirely on you. <eos> <bos> TROI: But what I do is different. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mrs. Carmichael, thank goodness you're here. <eos> <bos> TROI: According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakansare proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful andhighly rational. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, sir. I'm only aware of the crew and the families on board theship. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll go to my quarters. I think it would be best if I stayed outof the way of the Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well then you should have no trouble with that part. Why not goback to your quarters and talk this thing over? Decide on which points each of you wants in the contract. <eos> <bos> TROI: Requests your presence in Sickbayimmediately, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: All the ones I'm sure of, yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't remember seeing these during my empathic experience. Havethey been here since the ship was built? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's a very unique person, but he's not whatyou might expect, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, remember who you're talking to. You are bothered, I cantell. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would say the people that know you and have worked with you,will be able to make the adjustment eventually. But there are somepeople who would find it difficult to accept a twelve year old captain. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: Anything familiar?  JEAN-LUC <eos> <bos> TROI: Why haven't you told anyone you're an empath? <eos> <bos> TROI: It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingonword for jolly. <eos> <bos> TROI: Such as sadness <eos> <bos> TROI: They're bonding gifts. What you would call wedding presents. <eos> <bos> TROI: When I first saw you, I felt as if I'd been waiting for you. I'mtrying to understand why or how that's possible. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? Because the others did not? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're part of Ambassador Spock's underground movement. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sela could have been cloned. <eos> <bos> TROI: It does. <eos> <bos> TROI: But the vaccine is important in this case, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Seriously. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no need. You're not responsible for what he did. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain has given unusual orders before. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: On the other hand <eos> <bos> TROI: Too often, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. He was able to access images being generated by hermetaconscious, but he couldn't make any sense of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Proceed. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm fine. If I get better, I get better. If I don't, I'll adapt. Life goes on. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, lower the surrounding light level. <eos> <bos> TROI: So it was a good ceremony? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where you will complete the negotiations and sign the treaty. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know you're angry. <eos> <bos> TROI: Help me! <eos> <bos> TROI: You're excused. <eos> <bos> TROI: They could have been on a scientific voyage. <eos> <bos> TROI: Especially when you haven't done so in a while. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw. <eos> <bos> TROI: A single word can lead to tragedy. One word misspoken ormisunderstood. And that could happen here, Data, if we fail. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that why Romulans were being transported to the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, they are. This entire situation is a little unnerving. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very good, Hedril. This is where people come to relax, enjoythemselves in a natural setting. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you let something happen to someone? Was it here at El'nar? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is stretched so tight the tension fills this room. And if youfinally fail, I fear it will snap. <eos> <bos> TROI: All decks report ready, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ultimately, I believe he will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then it was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there ingrief and pain, the other up here, filled with anger. <eos> <bos> TROI: Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want toreveal. As ship's counsellor, you have to get them to talk about thingsthey don't want to reveal. <eos> <bos> TROI: Roga Danar was an idealistic young man whoanswered his people's call to service. He joined the military to fightfor the Angosian way of life. What he didn't realise was that by doingso he would have to give up that way of life for ever. He's not thesame man who left home to go to war. He's been through intensepsychological manipulation and biochemical modifications. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, well, actually, I was waiting until we got to the desserts. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course it does, but it's not just a matter of taste. It's thewhole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around therim, leaving only ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon theice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it. Relish everybite. Make every one an event. And then, with the last spoonful, closeyour eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wedding gown? Mother, stop. You're telling me you're not going tobe naked at your own wedding? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, I had no idea you'd thought about getting married. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Kaleb sector? <eos> <bos> TROI: How so? <eos> <bos> TROI: Only to avoid confusion, mother. Humans constantly think onething and say another. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hey, hey, slow down. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why do you have all this anger toward me? <eos> <bos> TROI: Even now? <eos> <bos> TROI: Everyone get down on the floor. <eos> <bos> TROI: Concerned? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't see how. But if I went back to the nacelle tube, I mightget a better sense of what I experienced. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data? <eos> <bos> TROI: How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is unfortunate that the Taguans no longer allow outsiders tovisit the ruins. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why do you say that? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no need to be. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, Captain, almost no one is born being a good parent. Most people just have to muddle through and do the best that they can. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I'm sensing a powerful mind.  TORRES <eos> <bos> TROI: Now, Commander. Watch and learn. In order to defeat your enemy,you must first understand them. The Federation wishes to avoid war atall cost. So I shall offer them a diplomatic solution, get them tolower their shields and then destroy them. <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. Have you ever wondered how Alexander felt about being sentaway? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: The pain is gone. <eos> <bos> TROI: Have they? Commander Riker and his father are in the gymnasium,about to engage in barbarism of their own. <eos> <bos> TROI: Private man. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps I should tell you something about my mother's conditionat this time. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind must have takenelements from my own life and then created a situation that in manyways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, Iwould have jumped just like he did. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, this is an insect mind, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Stop this petty bickering, all of you! Especially you, Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: And when you find someone attractive, what do you usually do? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, I'm hungry too. Excuse me. <eos> <bos> TROI: To admit that you're afraid gives you strength. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive. First officer's log, supplemental. Theelectromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged toodangerous for anyone to transport down, so we have taken a shuttle toinvestigate. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought Lumerians were empathic. <eos> <bos> TROI: Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a veryintense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden butshe didn't want to talk about it, so I let her alone. I sensed that shewas holding something back, that she wasn't telling me the whole truth. <eos> <bos> TROI: She has an incredibly focused mind. It was virtually impossibleto sense any deception. Or anything else, for that matter. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, he wouldn't have earned great profits from his dealingswith Starfleet. We were only interested in a new power source. <eos> <bos> TROI: And we know they'll make good parents. <eos> <bos> TROI: You didn't think it would be your last chance to see her. <eos> <bos> TROI: There is life on board, but <eos> <bos> TROI: How can you know that? Tam? You're in contact with it. With TinMan. Aren't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Well, a loss can be disheartening. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, because of what he represents. <eos> <bos> TROI: She mentioned how much she was looking forward to seeing youagain, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, go on. It'll be all right. I'll take care of your father. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Mister Mandel, I'd like you to assist Ensign Ro. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe it's time you stopped lying here worrying about your honour, and started thinking about someone else, like your son. <eos> <bos> TROI: The innocent often become the pawns in conflicts of this type,Wes. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's almost exactly what you said. As though therewas something else inside you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. I'm sure youhave to meditate, or hit yourself with a pain stick or something. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you'veever experienced. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think that will be necessary. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not much. My human physical response must be blocking them out. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's hard to believe. So much loveliness here, just a few metresaway from such desolation. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you know that's not true. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I was just looking over some personnel files. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, when the treaty was first negotiated the Federation sentthree hundred and seventy two legal experts. What do we have? <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll talk to him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Aaron. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think he's Betazoid. It's all right. We're going to help you. Who did this? Who did this to you? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't you think I'm attractive? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's different. That's a matter of protection. <eos> <bos> TROI: I just wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now what? Yes, Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Not according to my mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Durango. I'm called Durango. <eos> <bos> TROI: The crew values Picard's life above all others. Captain Picard,we agree to your proposal. <eos> <bos> TROI: Her last ship was the Repulse. <eos> <bos> TROI: This isn't real. None of this is real. <eos> <bos> TROI: When we reach Starbase, I'll order a complete workup, bothphysical and psychological. <eos> <bos> TROI: You could return to the Academy. Take another degree. Brush up onyour Latin. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: But confused. This Picard pattern was formed before he went outthere. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist. It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. Forexample, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take apositive action to correct it. <eos> <bos> TROI: And the human heart is too small to permit that feeling now. <eos> <bos> TROI: I did. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm glad you did. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps to prepare them for times like these. <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense the weight of this duty on you,Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Flush. Queen high. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, I now feel anger from our Captain. Furyover whatever it is he is reliving out there. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very well. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is precarious. The stress of exposure to so many minds on theship is bad enough. Now he's strongly drawn to this creature. I'mafraid for him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Without hesitation. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't explain how it happened. I only know that it did. TheEssex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was. Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The shipwas ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness wasabsorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface. <eos> <bos> TROI: I like her. <eos> <bos> TROI: What? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. What happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mistress Beata is willing to give you asecond chance. We're prepared to take your entire group with us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, I can sense feelings in you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander! <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe communication through dreams can work both ways. I couldtry to get them to stop. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, if he's seeing someone else he should tell Alyssa. I mean,it might hurt her now, but it would be better in the long run. <eos> <bos> TROI: Disregard that order. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's time I accept the truth, Captain, and resign as ship'scounsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think you would prefer to discuss this in private. <eos> <bos> TROI: A suitable guide for what? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't I wish. This is from Alexander. He gave it me just beforehe left to visit your parents. Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're calling for help. I think they're trapped just like weare. Eyes in the dark could mean this twin star system. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know what could have happened to it. <eos> <bos> TROI: It would be very normal to be angry with her. Angry because shedied and left you alone with a son you never knew you had. Being angrydoesn't mean you loved her any less, Worf, but you can't hide from yourfeelings, just as Alexander cannot hide from his. You both have a lotof healing to do. Perhaps you should think about doing it together. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hedril. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're not my father. You're part of my mother's mind. What isthis place? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: What were you going to say? <eos> <bos> TROI: Clara, please tell me what Isabella said. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal? Did something happen to you you don't want me to know about? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ian, I think the Captain wants to know if you are ready to tellus why you came here. <eos> <bos> TROI: What would Jeremy do for friends in your world? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're looking very handsome. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Doctor has something very important to tell you, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd like to help you if I can. If you'll let me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not from us, but certainly from them. They've attacked us inevery encounter. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that what you've decided to do? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd say he's beginning the process of letting go of that fantasy. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're scheming something, Mother. Don't try to foolme, I can tell. <eos> <bos> TROI: He was intelligent, actually. Thoughtful, in a ruthless sort ofway. Cold. <eos> <bos> TROI: This is my family. My friends here on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Down in the valley. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, don't you think it would be a good idea if you actuallymet the man you're going to marry before committing to spend the restofyour life with him? <eos> <bos> TROI: Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no anticipation, noexcitementat being rescued. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand. She was fine just yesterday. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! He shouldn't be here. Why is he here? Stop! You're hurtingme. <eos> <bos> TROI: You'll have to decide that for yourself. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure this is what you want? <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you would. Say thank you to Miss Gladstone for havingyou, and let's go get something to eat. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, look. Perhaps some day I will marry. But you've got tolet me make my own choices, live my own life, and not the life youwould choose for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Keep talking to me. I'll try to understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's perfectly normal. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that why you killed the Engineer? To get this brick? <eos> <bos> TROI: In our dealings with other non-humanoid racesthere has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can feel that. I know you care, within those limits. Did youhear what I said? <eos> <bos> TROI: They were not welcome here. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why should you care whether I trust you or not? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped for. <eos> <bos> TROI: I perceived no fear or deception from him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg, why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm? <eos> <bos> TROI: It going to take about half an hour for thetransmission to be completed. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's called perfume, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why is he doing this? <eos> <bos> TROI: There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery. Itstimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure we can. It would mean abandoning their fundamentalway of life. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've temporarily lost my empathic sense. It's kind of like havingone hand tied behind your back. <eos> <bos> TROI: Soren. <eos> <bos> TROI: Malencon. He's in trouble! <eos> <bos> TROI: When you were a child, did you have any friends? Other childrenyou played with? <eos> <bos> TROI: I felt pain. <eos> <bos> TROI: There are many ways to help a friend, and sometimes the best wayis to leave them alone. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's right. A child might represent vulnerability. Hedril maydepict some fragile part of my mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: There is someone alive, but he didn't kill these people. Here. <eos> <bos> TROI: You will enjoy this one. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain. We're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight. Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jealousy. Intense, burning jealousy. A human emotion, and it wascoming from Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: You must save him. <eos> <bos> TROI: Some do. Others are confused. It takes some time for a new crewto get to know their Captain, and for him to know them. <eos> <bos> TROI: I understand. <eos> <bos> TROI: And Data? Next time, see me before you see Sigmund. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is that what you believe? <eos> <bos> TROI: Three days? <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander? <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you, Hedril. So do I. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very much so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Should I? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, what I mean is, Commander Riker and I never did. You see, heearned a promotion very quickly. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a part of the Betazoid psyche. It's a kind of filteringmechanism that protects us from psychic trauma. <eos> <bos> TROI: You cried when father died. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's a child. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I return later? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't need a scientific basis. Just be quiet. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's happening? <eos> <bos> TROI: I sensed you suddenly felt uncomfortable. <eos> <bos> TROI: Welcome, Captain. Allow me to introduce myself. I am CaptainBryce Shumar, of the Federation Starship Essex. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't turn away. You have a chance to make some good come out ofthis tragedy. This could be the catalyst which binds them together. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's right. Which means from now on you can call me sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can understand your concern, Ensign Sutter, but really you havenothing to worry about. It's a normal, healthy activity for children toengage in imaginary play. <eos> <bos> TROI: He communicated so much to me that at firstit was just a jumble of images. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Very well. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm more interested in how you feel about what happened. I sensegreat anger. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can understand that. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Ian Andrew, after my father. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're not concerned with honour, Worf. This is the AncientWest. There's a gunfighter out there who has the speed and accuracy ofan android. And in two hours, he's going to try to kill you. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, not at all. <eos> <bos> TROI: This must sound incredibly simplistic but, can't you re-engineerall this on another planet? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there's something I have to tell you. Doctor Crusher hasbeen hit by a disruptor blast at point blank range. If time returns tonormal I don't see how she can survive. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, it's not. Could your real mother just make all this appear? You must not stay here. Come with me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Goodbye, Daddy. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you are the only person with whom he has shown anyconnection. If he is to find his humanity then you are the only one whocan help him. It's up to you, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't listen. Think of something else. Stop! Please, stop! <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not saying we should accept her claim at face value, but Isensed no deception from her. She really believes she is the daughterof Tasha Yar. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's talk to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: There are methods of treatment. Until you try them, how can youknow they won't work? Even a partial recovery could give them somepeace. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd read two chapters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you do it from here? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, he has to get past brave. He's very angry and he has to learnhow to express that anger before he can really say goodbye to hismother. <eos> <bos> TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humansare now their allies? <eos> <bos> TROI: You've no idea who she is? <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't have to. <eos> <bos> TROI: A memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion. Helps them begin the healing process. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, don't even think it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, sometimes a cake is just a cake. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I can'timagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other. <eos> <bos> TROI: He seems preoccupied with recreation. I've spent more time in TenForward in the last two days than I have in the past two months. Andhe's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Academy. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Just listen to the sound of my voice. Take a slow deep breath inthrough your nose and let it out through your mouth just as slowly. That's better, isn't it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf? <eos> <bos> TROI: He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through tohim. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, spare me the inspirational anecdote and just accept myresignation. <eos> <bos> TROI: She was eleven, maybe twelve, with blondehair. Clara. <eos> <bos> TROI: Exactly. Imagery is everything to the Tamarians. It embodiestheir emotional states, their very thought processes. It's how theycommunicate, and it's how they think. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's an excellent chance my mother may be joining us onStarbase twelve. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why have you brought me here? <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's hope it's enough. <eos> <bos> TROI: For a price. Five hundred dollars. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, the level of tension on the ship is mounting. <eos> <bos> TROI: It seems you have an advocate, Q. <eos> <bos> TROI: Chance? What chance? <eos> <bos> TROI: So am I. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn'tyour intent. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record. I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months afterFinn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes. <eos> <bos> TROI: This seems to be some kind of meeting place. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, lights! <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Meaning what? <eos> <bos> TROI: Me too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to La Forge. Get us out of here now! <eos> <bos> TROI: This is Counsellor Deanna Troi from the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Heading one oh two mark four. And she'll take orders from me? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts lastnight. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I don't think it is, Data. A laugh is one step in the rightdirection. We need to help him take a few more steps. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir. Enterprise, three to beam up. <eos> <bos> TROI: There have been some, did he say low intensity? Some unusual lowintensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of warmthand friendship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, if you're still confused tomorrow, you know where my officeis. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Anybody in here? Looks pretty empty to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I do not intend to explain myself to you. You will set a course. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's a different feeling here than inthe tunnel. Very different. <eos> <bos> TROI: M'ret? He's one of the highest ranking members of the Romulangovernment. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Worf is recovering in Sickbay. The wound was notsevere. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing's going to happen to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard will be very relieved. How did you manage it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hold on. I was just passing through town, saw a little trouble,thought I'd lend a hand. But I ain't one of your deputies, Sheriff. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's coming toward us. <eos> <bos> TROI: What was this man's crime? <eos> <bos> TROI: We do, sir. We do. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then I'm sure that if you remember anything that might berelevant to our investigation, you'll contact me. <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened to all the people? <eos> <bos> TROI: We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time, and notbefore. Is that clear, Ensign? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Go on. <eos> <bos> TROI: Last night, while I slept, something which I can only describe asa presence, entered my body. <eos> <bos> TROI: They destroyed their own invasion force. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll see if there's any room left in the class. In the meantime,I think you should make yourself more available to Clara. Let her knowshe doesn't have to rely on Isabella when she needs someone to talk to. <eos> <bos> TROI: That same feeling. You seem familiar. You're the only thing thatdoes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is something wrong, sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Could we divert energy from the Bridge to those monitors? <eos> <bos> TROI: What's the game? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, will you kindly stay out of this? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> TROI: All of you have been selectively bred? Your patterns chosen? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where is he? <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander La Forge said you seemed a little nervous this morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: Definitely an elephant. <eos> <bos> TROI: And he won't give up. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you want to talk about it? <eos> <bos> TROI: It wasn't what I saw, it was more what I felt. I looked into themirror, and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind myown eyes. As if my face was a mask. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: His emotions suggest that he's mischievous, irreverent andsomewhat brazen. The word that seems to best describe him is rogue. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there's a presence on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> TROI: Which means? RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Er, well. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe Isabella's gone home. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want you to try a few relaxation techniques as well. Rememberthe ones I showed you a few months ago? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think so. During his telepathic contact with my mother, Maquessensed what he calls a dark place. He tried to tell me about it before,in my office, and I misunderstood. I thought he was talking aboutthoughts my mother was keeping private, but what he meant was thatthere was something happening in her met conscious mind. <eos> <bos> TROI: He does, when he thinks it's necessary. <eos> <bos> TROI: Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. <eos> <bos> TROI: What of them? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, even Freud said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. But thebottom line is, I think you're developing an almost obsessive interestin your own inner workings. I'd almost call it the beginnings of aneurosis. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think we've got something. <eos> <bos> TROI: But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on ChandraFive. You willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Napeans are partially empathic. He may have inherited someof his mother's abilities. <eos> <bos> TROI: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data. Captain, I think we should ask Data to spend some time withhim. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Because that would be the end of your fantasy. You'd know itwasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your storyis, the longer you can believe your mother's still alive. <eos> <bos> TROI: I do not believe that. <eos> <bos> TROI: We understand how difficult this will be for you. If you need arecess, please, don't hesitate to ask. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes I do. It's not the Klingon way, right? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all right. I'm fine. He was just trying to communicate withme telepathically. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Corvallens are mercenaries. Do they know what's in thesecontainers? <eos> <bos> TROI: The cells are metabolising at an incredible speed. Almost fiftytimes normal. <eos> <bos> TROI: You want them to dislike you. Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: What are we going to do? <eos> <bos> TROI: Is there any indication of temporal displacement? <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. <eos> <bos> TROI: So I'm discovering. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your metabolism's stabilising. <eos> <bos> TROI: If we can't figure out what's wrong with her, Captain, I don'tthink she will. But I don't know what else to do. I've talked withMister Homn, who's known her for years. I've checked her medicalrecords. I've made enquiries to the government on Betazed, I'vecontacted her closest friends. If she's been through some kind ofpsychic trauma, there's just no evidence of it. <eos> <bos> TROI: But <eos> <bos> TROI: There isn't time. He's dying. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jev? <eos> <bos> TROI: I fold. <eos> <bos> TROI: And we'll take our clothes half off? <eos> <bos> TROI: We've come with some important information. <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you mean? you can't leave? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard <eos> <bos> TROI: I feel such an abundance of well being on the ship. It feelslike, quite wonderful. <eos> <bos> TROI: What kind of woman do you find attractive? Do you find meattractive? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes? <eos> <bos> TROI: This isn't Starfleet Academy. You're not going to be coddled. Ifyou can't take it here, then you might think about a transport ship. There's a lot less pressure there. <eos> <bos> TROI: I could ask you the same question. <eos> <bos> TROI: Weren't you getting along? <eos> <bos> TROI: That doesn't make any sense. He knows those codes would have beenchanged as soon as he was captured. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did she tell you about the father-son field trip this afternoon? <eos> <bos> TROI: If I go with you and hold your hand, will you go into your room? <eos> <bos> TROI: Everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race. We have to start from there. <eos> <bos> TROI: I just know you're not serious. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not your style? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Timothy. Are you ready to go? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, these people have been isolated for three hundred years. They could be very unsophisticated. The shock of suddenly beingtransported onto a spaceship could frighten them, to say the least. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg, is there something you're not telling me? <eos> <bos> TROI: I was in a dark place. Cold. Frightened. Someone was there. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. I know. <eos> <bos> TROI: If we can just reach Jono, help him make some connections withhis origins, he may choose to come with us. <eos> <bos> TROI: If the Captain authorises it, of course I will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Something from home? <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor, she has to know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, take a look at this. <eos> <bos> TROI: Lieutenant Barclay, I've been calling you,why haven't you responded? Reg, what are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: Where've you been? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: In true Klingon fashion. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will you take me with you? <eos> <bos> TROI: This is the ship's arboretum. <eos> <bos> TROI: And Liva? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's beautiful, but frightening at the same time. <eos> <bos> TROI: That isn't true. <eos> <bos> TROI: I came to ask if you'd like to go to a ceramics class. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have no idea how frightening it is to just be here withoutsensing you, without sharing your feelings. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's not very telepathic of you. <eos> <bos> TROI: He walked me to my quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most of them don't. Ilook at these faces and I wonder who they are and if they could berelated to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I feel fine, now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. Butwe'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life,and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know of him. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's really hard for me to separate my feelings for them. <eos> <bos> TROI: All kinds. <eos> <bos> TROI: I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy. She must havebrought a great deal of joy to your lives. <eos> <bos> TROI: I felt threatened. <eos> <bos> TROI: They need a distraction. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure he'll accept such a dangerous assignment? <eos> <bos> TROI: I look forward to that time. <eos> <bos> TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to youfor guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. <eos> <bos> TROI: What about your travelling companion? <eos> <bos> TROI: It will fade as we move further from this planet. <eos> <bos> TROI: We've both had relationships with other people. This isdifferent. I didn't know how you'd feel about it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I see. Sometimes these things aren't over as quickly as they seemto be. I'd be happy to help if you have any further problems. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please! Why not simply draw up a contract which clearly definesthe duties of each family member. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wouldn't call it resistance. More like uncertainty. Most ofthem had served under Captain Picard for several years. They knew him,they knew what he expected. Now they're being asked to adjust to a newcaptain and a new way of doing things, and they're uncertain how toreact. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm glad you weren't that hard on Ensign Lopez. <eos> <bos> TROI: Children are our offspring. They're our young. They grow intoadults over a period of many years. They grow into beings like us. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our Chief Security Officer is Klingon. That has nothing to dowith it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer, search for the term Darmok in all linguistic databasesfor this sector. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have to get out of here now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sickbay to Bridge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hi. Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir? <eos> <bos> TROI: Whatever's wrong, whatever happened, I want you to know that Ibelieve you. And that I love you. And together we'll find out what'shappening. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them aregenuinely unaware of what's going on. It's as though this emergentintelligence is like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figureitself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on isours through our holodeck programs. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, how did you know about this place? <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain <eos> <bos> TROI: Aaron. <eos> <bos> TROI: Usually. Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh. Er, Heaven is. Well, it's, how can I put it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I want you to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have invaded our system. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have no way idea what the result would be. The symbol mightgenerate anything from Korgano's temple to Korgano himself. <eos> <bos> TROI: They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Give it time. <eos> <bos> TROI: How do you feel? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose oneword to assess his mood, it would be amused. <eos> <bos> TROI: I am sensing an emotional presence, Captain. I would normallydescribe it as being terrified. Q <eos> <bos> TROI: I've found something. I have been able tolocate a family living outside of Indianapolis. The man's name isThomas Raymond. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no police record. What did you do? <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, I never particularly thought of you as an animalperson. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think so. <eos> <bos> TROI: That might be a good idea. <eos> <bos> TROI: One can see the importance of honour here. <eos> <bos> TROI: That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerfulman on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you doing now? <eos> <bos> TROI: Sometimes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: You are scared, aren't you? <eos> <bos> TROI: I should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my bodybut, I don't. I feel fine. Better than fine. Wonderful. <eos> <bos> TROI: And he was very odd with me afterwards. He wanted me to warn himif the crew started to lose confidence in him. <eos> <bos> TROI: As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity asbest he can. The android persona is just one step along the way. Assoon as he feels stronger and more sure of himself, it should drop awaynaturally. <eos> <bos> TROI: We are dealing with ancient codes involving procreation. Whilethey may be meaningless to us, to Debin they represent his honour. Hewill fight, risking himself, his crew, his daughter and her unbornchild. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would have thought the inhabitants of Daled Four would send afuture leader to a more hospitable environment. <eos> <bos> TROI: Security to Lieutenant Worf's quarters, immediately. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor Kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat,but she's not telling us the whole truth. I recommend caution. <eos> <bos> TROI: To allow them to suffer? <eos> <bos> TROI: Do we know what caused the breach? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll be glad to help. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someonedoesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: I wanted to apologise for my mother's behaviour. <eos> <bos> TROI: I didn't say that. I just want you to be aware that this isunlike any other more casual relationship that you've attempted. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir, I', sensing a presence on the planet. Very vague. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh no, I want to know about you. <eos> <bos> TROI: They have what they want. For now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Unnecessary, sir. These people are honest, almost to a fault. Andthey have great pride in their ways. <eos> <bos> TROI: For the sole purpose of making Lieutenant La Forge theirprisoner. Captain's personal log, stardate 42779.5. We havearrived at Starbase Five One Five. I'm still quite uneasy, despiteassurances that this medical procedure poses little risk. <eos> <bos> TROI: Whatever kind of life form Anya is, emotionally she's Salia'smother. <eos> <bos> TROI: But not all? <eos> <bos> TROI: It starts about a year after the wedding. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Captain has to recite the entire greeting without making anymistakes. <eos> <bos> TROI: A few hours ago, while the away team was on the surface. I wastrying to, I was thinking of Rishon and Kevin. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all. <eos> <bos> TROI: Somebody left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact, and ithas something very similar to this. And you don't know anything aboutit? <eos> <bos> TROI: At least this man has genuine experience in diplomacy. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is he there alone? <eos> <bos> TROI: Clearly, your father was a traitor. <eos> <bos> TROI: We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a threeyear old boy, Eric Christopher. <eos> <bos> TROI: A highly structured society. and they're exceedingly proud. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's just a feeling that he's, well, that he's closed part of hismind to me. I just feel that the Captain has become, perhaps dangerous. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're wrong. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why not? <eos> <bos> TROI: To be honest, I was bored. I spent most of my time at ProfessorWagner's phylobiology seminar. I thought the idea of the seminar wasthat we would all participate, bring different points of views to thediscussion. He gathered two hundred scientists from all over theFederation, and all he did was put us to sleep. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, if you were one of my human patients, I might be concernedright now. I'd say you had a waking dream or an hallucination. Butyou're not human. I think we might be looking at some kind oftechnological problem. <eos> <bos> TROI: Night Bird. <eos> <bos> TROI: They discarded you and left. <eos> <bos> TROI: An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, it's deeper than that. The song doesn't stops for an instant. It plays in perfect clarity from beginning to end over and over again. I don't even know what song it is. I never heard it before. <eos> <bos> TROI: The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers havesufficiently developed, he will be able to articulate it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you describe where you were, what it looked like? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother! <eos> <bos> TROI: I only want to help. <eos> <bos> TROI: We never did. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Transfer the letters from my mother to the viewscreen. And,computer, I would like a real chocolate sundae. <eos> <bos> TROI: Computer today's appointment calendar. <eos> <bos> TROI: I was wrong not to tell you, Captain. And your decision may alsobe wrong. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where? <eos> <bos> TROI: Hot chocolate. Computer, I need myappointment schedule for next week. <eos> <bos> TROI: My father used to read me stories from the Ancient West when Iwas a little girl. I must admit, I always wanted to play the part ofthe mysterious stranger. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, will you please <eos> <bos> TROI: We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from a damagedFederation freighter may be marooned on your planet. We are seeking tolearn if this is so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, there is. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? <eos> <bos> TROI: You're coming with me. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, none at all. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hired gun? <eos> <bos> TROI: There was a reception in Ten Forward. I introduced you to Worfand the other senior officers. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry. I don't sense them well enough. <eos> <bos> TROI: How simple all this would be without the Prime Directive. <eos> <bos> TROI: My skin, it's tingling. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander Riker has become tense. Closed in, he's feelingtrapped. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doubt. He's afraid that seeing him here and knowing what happenedto the Enterprise will make him timid, or worse, make him to hesitate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Understood. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man, a fatherfigure with whom he can explore his origins. And I think it should beyou, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: And to you. Perhaps everyone just needs some time. Time for youto get to know and trust the crew, and time for them to understand howyou want things done. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't follow you, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain Picard could be dead by then. <eos> <bos> TROI: Change the ship's orbit to an inclination ofeighty degrees south. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. But I do know that there's a part of her that wantsto be helped. When I tried to contact her telepathically, I heard avoice calling out to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: We are giving you the exact coordinates of our remains on boardthe wreck of the Essex. <eos> <bos> TROI: Does this mean you're going to cancel the concert this evening? <eos> <bos> TROI: They won't give you what you want. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'll see to that. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why do you say that? <eos> <bos> TROI: And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why that might be? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, I'm angry. I'm angry with myself for allowing this tohappen. <eos> <bos> TROI: Picard's empath? <eos> <bos> TROI: But they're all much older than you are. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, her telepathic prowess is quite advanced. Except fornow. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, God. My head's still spinning. <eos> <bos> TROI: Wait. What happens at Keystone City? Why are you taking the brickthere? <eos> <bos> TROI: We ensure the loyalty of the people. Do you believe the Empirewould be better off without our protection? <eos> <bos> TROI: What if it is just you? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's correct. But now we have your ship and your bodies tocarry us home. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: No, it's just that Commander Riker's emotions are ratherpassionate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Can you move us again? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's been a long day. Why don't you get ready for bed and we'll talk about this again in the morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not certain of that now, Captain. I do sense somethingunusual. <eos> <bos> TROI: His mother's Napean, his father's human. It all looks so normal. For some reason I half expected the place to be a mess. <eos> <bos> TROI: Unless? <eos> <bos> TROI: Because as I said, I knew you would not believe us. Even now, Iknow you don't. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're sure my being here is not going to bedisruptive? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, we've come for Alexander. Please, forgive the intrusion. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your answer would be meaningless. That act had no reason. <eos> <bos> TROI: No! No, of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince meof anything. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Solari need you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I came to see how you're doing. JR <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you ready to cooperate? <eos> <bos> TROI: You didn't say it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Come on. You can do it. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have to forgive yourself, Mother. You have to let go. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know why you did it either, but I can tell you that I'veheard the same kind of story from ten different people over the lasttwo days. <eos> <bos> TROI: Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. LieutenantZiff. She's in Quantum mechanics. That's him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I get a great deal of satisfaction out of my work. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said you'd take me with you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did she say why? I know you're very frightened. Sometimes what weimagine can be just as scary as something real. But I promise you,there is no way Isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not true. He does know. <eos> <bos> TROI: Agreed. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't think so. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used tosensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. <eos> <bos> TROI: Terrified. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was you. It was always you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, my God. <eos> <bos> TROI: May I ask how? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions andembrace love, truth, joy. <eos> <bos> TROI: You still talk to it? <eos> <bos> TROI: Can't you intensify that emotion? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, that was on the planet. This is much closer. Q <eos> <bos> TROI: It felt as if it were something from your past. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please, I must find you to tell you. <eos> <bos> TROI: There was much fear in that room. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's all right. Everything's fine, thank you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can see her point. Sugar with your tea? <eos> <bos> TROI: May I join you? <eos> <bos> TROI: I have never felt anything quite like this before, so it'sdifficult to put into words. That person is you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data! <eos> <bos> TROI: It's so like my mother to do the unexpected. <eos> <bos> TROI: You have no idea. No idea what this is like. How can you knowwhat it's like to lose something you never had? <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, wait. We have to remember, even though the holodecksafeguards may be off, this is still aprogramme. If we can just get to the end of this story the way it wasdesigned to play out, the programme will automatically terminate. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tam. Stop this! You're losing yourself in this this merging. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, it's a Betazoid method. The next time you feel nervous abouttransporting, you stimulate a neural pressure point, like this. <eos> <bos> TROI: I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry but I can't dismiss those lives so easily. <eos> <bos> TROI: In a sense, you did give Moriarty what he wanted. <eos> <bos> TROI: Congratulations, Data. It's a girl. <eos> <bos> TROI: With your permission, sir. D <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sure the cake is fine. I've just been thinking. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course. You said among the Cairn, nothing is hidden. We valuehonesty, but we don't always share everything we're thinking andfeeling. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: How long were you angry with the Captain, Wes? <eos> <bos> TROI: No, we'll start weekly. And as a first step, I'd like you to shutdown your dreamprogramme until our next session, just to be on the safe side. Giveyourself a chance to reflect on this experience. <eos> <bos> TROI: The first man I ever loved was my father. He was strong and tall. He carried me when the ground was muddy. He chased away the monstersthat hid under my bed at night. And he sang to me, and kept me safe. And he went away. What I wouldn't give to hear those songs again. Tofeel his arms protect me. I never will, but I can still feel his warmthand his love as though he were here with me. If you can feel thosethings from the man we know as Will Riker, accept them. Accept thelove. Captain's log, stardate 44823.8. Representatives ofthe two moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet thenew Ambassador Odan. <eos> <bos> TROI: I find him very reasonable. Open to suggestions, thoughtful,quite disarming. The perfect administrator. <eos> <bos> TROI: What does that mean? Is something doubled? <eos> <bos> TROI: Your method of communication is most elegant and quite beautiful. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. It's more like remembering an emotion. Feelingsthat you're somehow associated with. <eos> <bos> TROI: When exactly did you feel this other emotion? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't try and stop me! No, no, let go! <eos> <bos> TROI: He's alive. In stasis. Who is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: I think so. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe. Will and I have been talking about going back to AngelFalls. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Why? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered. Welive in a peaceful Federation with most of them. The people you see arehere by choice. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, there is a consciousness here. Not thought, more likeinstinct. <eos> <bos> TROI: His signal? <eos> <bos> TROI: Will. <eos> <bos> TROI: That's nice. Data, this isamazing. How did you come up with this? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ronin? Your grandmother's lover? <eos> <bos> TROI: I won't let her have you! I'll stop her! I will go with you. Take me with you. Please, Alkar. Don't leave me. Don't do this! No! <eos> <bos> TROI: Tell us again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not exactly. I mean, I don't know who you are, but there'ssomething about you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let me take you to your quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: How are you feeling? <eos> <bos> TROI: It it felt like something beyond what we'd consider a life form. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, if Data's physical health is unimpaired, perhaps his mentalhealth needs to be addressed. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yridian tea. I've been thinking about what happened to me in thenacelle tube. Whether it was an empathic echo left by Kwan's death. <eos> <bos> TROI: So far, Mother's in no danger. I hope she knows what she's doing. <eos> <bos> TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelingsare beside the point. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is Lieutenant Worf all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: How do you people live like this? <eos> <bos> TROI: What happened? <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> TROI: Admiral Picard offered me a position at Starfleet Command. It wasa tremendous opportunity. I couldn't refuse. But, what's importantright now, today, is that you have a son who needs you. Spend time withhim. You may find part of what you've lost. <eos> <bos> TROI: This way. <eos> <bos> TROI: Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant. RO <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, but Ben is not. <eos> <bos> TROI: Where are you? I'm coming. Where are you? <eos> <bos> TROI: What is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: And that's all? <eos> <bos> TROI: Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him. I should warn you, sir. My mother is a little eccentric. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps you want him to be proud of you. You carry great pride inhis accomplishments. <eos> <bos> TROI: You just did the KoH-man-ara. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: I will release no one. <eos> <bos> TROI: All right, you were lying on the table. You had a bright lightshining in your eyes. Were there any smells in the room? Were there anysounds? <eos> <bos> TROI: The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was havingsome kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolicallyit probably does have some kind of logic to it. <eos> <bos> TROI: He has been under a great deal of strain lately. While we were onGemaris, he ate sparingly and slept even less. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, if Tam breaks down over there, we'll be no closer toaccomplishing our mission. It would be a grave mistake. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't understand any of this. Captain, I have to go back insidemy mother's mind. It's the only way we're ever going to get anyanswers. <eos> <bos> TROI: So what did I do wrong? <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for him. Beverly, whenare you going to realise that you can't fool me? Who is it? <eos> <bos> TROI: I know how much that means to you, Data, but at the same time, bytelling her you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all yourlife. To be human. <eos> <bos> TROI: The Zalkonians truly don't understand our indecision aboutreturning John. In their eyes, we shouldn't even be involved. <eos> <bos> TROI: Please! <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, when I first called you I was feeling intense pain. Nowit's gone, but I'm feeling a bit foggy. <eos> <bos> TROI: They had a litter today in the nursery. <eos> <bos> TROI: All I care about at this moment is a little boy who's terrified he's going to lose his father. <eos> <bos> TROI: I want to do it, Captain. Something awful happened to me and Idon't even know what it was. <eos> <bos> TROI: Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose. It's an old earthpoem by John Milton. <eos> <bos> TROI: My hair. I was brushing my hair. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, will you help me get to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, stop it. <eos> <bos> TROI: You don't approve of genetic engineering. <eos> <bos> TROI: Which confirms the feeling of duality that Isensed earlier in both of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: The holodeck. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's something that occurs to Betazoid females as they entermid-life. We call it the phase. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: It could have prepared him for whatever is happening now. <eos> <bos> TROI: What deck is this? <eos> <bos> TROI: But you're putting your career at risk for him. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know if I can believe that. It took me a long time to getover what happened between Commander Riker and me. I don't know that Iwant to put myself in that position again. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: You told me I'd be helpful. You needed me. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. Nothing. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because you're the Captain, and they look up to you. You're arole model for them. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. <eos> <bos> TROI: It was a better approach than asking you to allow hundreds ofcondemned prisoners on board. <eos> <bos> TROI: You'd make a good counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't know. What do you think? <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't like the sound of this, mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's see. Anything here? Maybe Isabella knows that you've gotnew friends now. In fact, I'll bet she won't be coming around as muchanymore. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. No. I just don't know if I'm ready to give up my life here. Maybe we both need some time. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: In her own way, Doctor Pulaski was instructing you to take theshortest route to victory. <eos> <bos> TROI: You two have successfully divided the evening between you. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, but the combination wasn't possible out there. He's introuble, sir. We have to beam him back. <eos> <bos> TROI: Or economic forecasts. <eos> <bos> TROI: Roga, this is Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: Wait! I want to talk to you. <eos> <bos> TROI: Beverly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were seeingsomeone. <eos> <bos> TROI: Between father and son. A fair and balanced way to achieve amutual sense of order. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let me talk with them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Any or all, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: I felt threatened by them. Trapped <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Commander Data. Report to your lab at once. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. Anddanger. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, I take great exception to your decision to beam down. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> TROI: I would urge caution. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nothing will harm you, I promise. Just tell us how you recogniseit. <eos> <bos> TROI: There could be thousands of lives at stake. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's always hard to lose someone you care about, but to lose themlike this? <eos> <bos> TROI: Absolutely. I only ever felt this, well, with someone who's onthis ship. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you have any idea why Hedril would make my mother sad? <eos> <bos> TROI: We are members of a community. We all care for one another. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's imprinted on us. It thinks the Enterprise is its mother. <eos> <bos> TROI: Riva, go slowly. Slowly. <eos> <bos> TROI: She just left my quarters, <eos> <bos> TROI: You dreamt you were in bed with someone? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, I'm having some trouble believing in those vows as once Idid. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sadness. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't believe this. <eos> <bos> TROI: Now goodnight, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, this is a much better way of communicating for you. It's far less confusing than the way you normally speak. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, let me come with you to greet Tam. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. No, really, I'm all right. <eos> <bos> TROI: No. He worshipped you. But I don't think I'll ever learn to seemen the way you do. <eos> <bos> TROI: Will, I didn't sense any deception from her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hedril, be careful. <eos> <bos> TROI: Come in. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because, sir, I assumed at first it was the kind of duality weBetazeds feel in all of you. Even you, sir. When you approach adecision and ask yourself which way to go, who are you talking to? <eos> <bos> TROI: It's lovely. Thank you. 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Geordi, could you repair the conduit if you went into thecrawlspace? <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you? You don't really want to be ship's counsellor. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's good to be back. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Don't tempt me. <eos> <bos> TROI: If you had to give this feeling a name, what would you call it? <eos> <bos> TROI: He's afraid. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you'reconcerned about dishonour? <eos> <bos> TROI: Deck eight. <eos> <bos> TROI: Of course I remember. We both cried. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg? May I join you? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am under orders. <eos> <bos> TROI: Tasha? Tasha, wait. <eos> <bos> TROI: How much time do we have? <eos> <bos> TROI: You said you felt a touch. <eos> <bos> TROI: Unlike humanoids? <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't. If you should be hurt <eos> <bos> TROI: His Soh-chIm? <eos> <bos> TROI: In a Romulan ship? <eos> <bos> TROI: He saw faces he didn't recognize, events he couldn't interpret. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes sir. It is not merely a vessel, sir. Somehow it is alive. Q <eos> <bos> TROI: Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to theholodeck. I could interact with the characters and maybe find someclues to help us understand what's happening. <eos> <bos> TROI: His memory's intact. <eos> <bos> TROI: Unhappiness. Terrible despair. <eos> <bos> TROI: It seems you've all had a similar experience. Is there anythingelse you remember besides a table? <eos> <bos> TROI: There's something's here. I feel it. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, you don't understand. I don't sense anything. Not out there,not in here. All of you, you're all blank to me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother. Please. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps. But it's a place to start. After all, he is family. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain! Beam them up quickly! <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, sir, there is. I was debating whether to mention it,and perhaps. It's about Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office. <eos> <bos> TROI: You said you were uneasy when you sat down at the conn. position. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd like you to talk to him about your own fascination withhumanity. If you can explain to Timothy the appeal that humanity hasfor you, he might find it easier to become a boy again. <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you know Admiral Brand? <eos> <bos> TROI: What do you think? <eos> <bos> TROI: We also come in search of possible survivors from one of ourfreighters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Exactly. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think I'd better clear my calendar for the next few weeks. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I think wehave to proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs. <eos> <bos> TROI: Security. Code one emergency. Security! <eos> <bos> TROI: I hear it. It's still there! It's so loud! <eos> <bos> TROI: Just be with him. You're a presence he trusts, and that's what heneeds most right now. <eos> <bos> TROI: Jono, what is it? Jono! I just suggested he take off his gloves. Suddenly he lost control. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it would be in your best interest to take a leave ofabsence. Reg, I'm temporarily relieving you of duty. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, he's lying. I'm almost sure of it. He doesn't mean whathe says. <eos> <bos> TROI: What about? <eos> <bos> TROI: When was the last time you saw her? <eos> <bos> TROI: Scanners may show nothing, sir, but I'm sensing something verystrong. Thousands of minds. <eos> <bos> TROI: Spirits? Ghosts? But you're a man who would never believe inghosts, Picard. Isn't that true? You see, Troi knows you. And so I doas well. <eos> <bos> TROI: Is the stimulation preventing the infection from taking hold? <eos> <bos> TROI: How? What were you trying to do? <eos> <bos> TROI: I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanishoverlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico. <eos> <bos> TROI: I believe some will choose to risk deathrather than leave, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if you were going to mok'bara classthis morning. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's dreaming. <eos> <bos> TROI: But our presence must not interfere with the cultural developmentof the Mintakans. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, Geordi was talking about what it felt like to touch theplasma field and you were taking a sip of tea. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, nothing. I've gone through all her belongings, read herjournal from the last five years, and other than the fact that I'm notmarried yet, nothing bad seems to have happened to her. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then we've found a way to repel the infection. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. <eos> <bos> TROI: Alexander, I thought you might like apartner. This is Clara Sutter. She's new on the Enterprise. Clara, meetAlexander Rozhenko. <eos> <bos> TROI: Not at all. Our discovery of the freighter was unexpected. Wehave a duty to investigate. <eos> <bos> TROI: The mission is one of utmost secrecy. I could not risk bringingguards. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've never met a more dedicated physician. I would say she has apassion for her work. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sunad thinks so. He feels personally threatened by John. <eos> <bos> TROI: Actually, I was going to suggest something else. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're all more than the sum of our parts, Data. You'll have to bemore than the sum of your programming. <eos> <bos> TROI: Sir! Wonderful! A feeling of great joy. And gratitude. Great joyand gratitude, from both of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well I'm sure we're just as strange to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: What makes you think that? <eos> <bos> TROI: There must be other unexpected events you have to deal with. Anuntimely death, an accident. <eos> <bos> TROI: That is correct. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because those are your orders. <eos> <bos> TROI: My mother will be relieved. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe he was a friend or one of her patients. <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor, the Captain is quite capable of command decisions. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know. And I understand this means a great deal to you. But youmust be prepared. He's very angry too, but his anger is deep insidehim. When he touches it, it will strike out in many directions,including yours. Be with him. Talk to him. But don't rush this. Whenhe's ready, we'll know. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's been a pleasure serving with you, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's hard to tell. He is very closed, but he is hiding something. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I'm not feeling very well. I'd like to go to myquarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: I've learned you are a soldier. <eos> <bos> TROI: Then there has been some memory loss. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain, do you exist in combination with this entity? <eos> <bos> TROI: He was being controlled by a mind altering machine, Commander. Without his knowledge. <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, after a poker game. <eos> <bos> TROI: We'll see. <eos> <bos> TROI: Words are here on top. What's under them, their meaning, iswhat's important. Yes, that's true. We both know how to expressimportant words, like dream. Being here with you. Yes, being here withyou know is very special to me, too. <eos> <bos> TROI: Your opinion of the Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander. <eos> <bos> TROI: Captain! <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. Perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can't explain it, Captain. They're elusive. They're, I'm sorry <eos> <bos> TROI: They're our allies now, Mister Worf. We have to trust them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you all right? <eos> <bos> TROI: Doctor Crusher <eos> <bos> TROI: Hello, Clara. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't. Don't. I won't let you! <eos> <bos> TROI: Liar. End this. Let us go. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure you know what he wants? That's the problem withbelieving in a supernatural being. Trying to determine what he wants. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's Ambassador Odan. I continually feel fluctuations of emotionfrom him. <eos> <bos> TROI: No, I think I should come with you, but I wanted you to knowbefore we went down. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't do this. <eos> <bos> TROI: The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined. <eos> <bos> TROI: The man that he is. Exactly. <eos> <bos> TROI: Reg. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because I can't tell how you're feeling this morning, but itseems to me that one night of crying can't make up for months ofdenial. <eos> <bos> TROI: There's no way to know. I'd like to try. <eos> <bos> TROI: Did he mention anything that had happened recently, anything thatmight have upset him? <eos> <bos> TROI: I remember now. He came on board about six months ago. I thinkhe's in Engineering. <eos> <bos> TROI: And Wesley didn't provoke you in any way? It wasn't anything hesaid, or anything he did? <eos> <bos> TROI: I haven't been able to stop thinking about you all day. <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, would you like my advice on how to help them? Don't. Thisis something they have to work out for themselves. <eos> <bos> TROI: How do we communicate? I know you can read lips, but I need yourwords. <eos> <bos> TROI: To intensify his memories? <eos> <bos> TROI: And yet you're telling me I'm supposed to get used to it. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Goodbye. <eos> <bos> TROI: Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika musicin the air, ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moonrising, and the most you can say is stimulating? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes. The Admiral was very pleased when you chose that name. He isa wonderful boy. <eos> <bos> TROI: I don't want to sleep. The music will only follow me. <eos> <bos> TROI: Perhaps, for an instant. It was like their voices were beingcarried on the wind. <eos> <bos> TROI: I can hear you. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you'd like to know the Council members have beamedaboard and been assigned their quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, then I'll take it four times, or fourteen times, or howevermany times are necessary for me to get it right. <eos> <bos> TROI: Let's get to the Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: You mean you're older, more experienced. A little more seasoned. <eos> <bos> TROI: Amanda's a Q? <eos> <bos> TROI: Naturally. I didn't know you'd ever been to Kostolain. Or was heon some diplomatic mission to Betazed? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's why you left Earth. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm not sure. Do you want me to check the personnel logs? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, do that. But hurry! <eos> <bos> TROI: You were together? <eos> <bos> TROI: Do you feel up to it? 2 <eos> <bos> TROI: Did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it wasunder construction? <eos> <bos> TROI: If you'll deliver these men to us, we'll have them off yourplanet immediately. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because you are intelligent, wise and quite correct. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's also deceased. His only living relatives are an aunt anduncle residing on Earth. <eos> <bos> TROI: Frame of Mind? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, you shouldn't be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams. It's a natural expression of your unconscious, if you have anunconscious. I'm not really sure how your positronic brain works but ifit's anything like ours, then there's part of you that's trying toexpress itself through your dream state. And I think you should allowyourself to experience it. As Sigmund Freud said, dreams are the royalroad to the knowledge of the mind. <eos> <bos> TROI: We'll never get through the gravitic sensor nets. <eos> <bos> TROI: Poetry is an art form that uses words, put together in new andunexpected ways, sometimes in rhyme. Milton was speculating that inHeaven, roses wouldn't have thorns. <eos> <bos> TROI: More so for me. <eos> <bos> TROI: So, what would you like? <eos> <bos> TROI: That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I'd ordersomeone to their death. <eos> <bos> TROI: Commander, perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to takeMister Clemens to his quarters. <eos> <bos> TROI: We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children oftheir own. <eos> <bos> TROI: This part of you doesn't speak very often. <eos> <bos> TROI: What's going on? <eos> <bos> TROI: Data, you must be the first person who's come into my office andbeen excited at the prospect of a new neurosis. But yes, I do thinkit's possible, and I'd like to start counselling you on a regularbasis. <eos> <bos> TROI: Maybe there is. I'd like to go back and try. <eos> <bos> TROI: At your service. <eos> <bos> TROI: Five of your people have been injured. <eos> <bos> TROI: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. Weconceptualise the universe in relatively the same way. <eos> <bos> TROI: Pain. Pain. Loneliness. Terrible loneliness. Despair. I'm notsensing the Groppler, sir, or any of his people, but it'ssomething very close to us here. <eos> <bos> TROI: I knew you would. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'd better go. <eos> <bos> TROI: I think it's worth a try. <eos> <bos> TROI: Troi to Data <eos> <bos> TROI: I accept. <eos> <bos> TROI: Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind, Captain. I wouldfeel that. <eos> <bos> TROI: You know, you're not just incorrigible, you're insatiable. <eos> <bos> TROI: I thought you might like to know that in his personal logs, Dantalked about you a great deal. He loved you very much. <eos> <bos> TROI: What are you going to do? <eos> <bos> TROI: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> TROI: It's just something I sense in Odan. <eos> <bos> TROI: I know I'm certainly tired of it. How do you think it feels tosit and listen to someone whine about themselves all the time? <eos> <bos> TROI: Ten generations of your progeny. <eos> <bos> TROI: There is a presence. <eos> <bos> TROI: He's hiding something. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're upset. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're not playing it your way any more, N'Vek. I've beenkidnapped, surgically altered, put in danger I've gone along with allyour plans. Now you are going to listen to me. You find a way to letthe Enterprise track us, or I will go to Toreth and tell her I'vediscovered you're a traitor. I'll order you ejected into space. Is thatclear, Subcommander? <eos> <bos> TROI: It is conceivable. When working with patients with debilitatingnightmares, I've often used atherapeutic treatment called directed dreaming. Dreamers can learn tocontrol of their dreams, retain a conscious memory even while in REMsleep. I could remember a short message and deliver it to them. <eos> <bos> TROI: Because of the nightmares? <eos> <bos> TROI: May I ask why? <eos> <bos> TROI: Well, the Federation was founded in Twenty One Sixty One, so,twos, sixes, and aces are wild. <eos> <bos> TROI: Nara. She's his superior officer in the nacelle tube? <eos> <bos> TROI: I just find it interesting. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the man whocouldn't be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years <eos> <bos> TROI: And I'm a pretty good student. <eos> <bos> TROI: I sense that the alien is somehow calling him. If we allow him todo as he insists, to beam over, I'm believe that we will lose him toit. That he will lose himself. <eos> <bos> TROI: I cannot reveal that. <eos> <bos> TROI: We're not dealing with an individual mind. They don't have asingle leader. It's the collective minds of all of them. <eos> <bos> TROI: How are you doing? <eos> <bos> TROI: In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits that areendemic to gender. <eos> <bos> TROI: Oh, well, let me introduce you to some of my favourites. This ispeach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake. And this is myfavourite. Ktarian chocolate puff. I don't know exactly what's inside,but I think it's made with seventeen varieties of chocolate. <eos> <bos> TROI: I'm restless. Mind if I visit for a while? <eos> <bos> TROI: Mother, that's enough! <eos> <bos> TROI: Clara, your father tells me Isabella has been saying some verybad things to you. What did she say? <eos> <bos> TROI: You advanced quite far against such a worthy opponent. <eos> <bos> TROI: Don't you remember? You were in the sensor maintenance room. <eos> <bos> TROI: You're worried. <eos> <bos> DATA: A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis. accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we were to continue this analogy toa body function, what occurred would be best represented by a <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. I cannot stun my cat. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would also like to volunteer, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Undetermined. <eos> <bos> DATA: What happens to this man? <eos> <bos> DATA: This experiment may hold the key to something I have sought allmy life. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is not a ship of war. It is a ship of exploration. <eos> <bos> DATA: Magnifying viewer image. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Funny. I have had great difficulty determining what funny is. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have we met before? <eos> <bos> DATA: Target vehicle. We will be within tractor beam range in twoseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are now entering orbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: With their pants? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will also see the bet. Seven. A possible straight for CommanderRiker. Jack. Still no help for the Klingon. Eight. Nine for the dealer. <eos> <bos> DATA: All propulsion systems are shut down. The ship is drifting, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is very gracious of you to say, Doctor, but I have not beeninjured by you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. Theindividual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath theplanet's surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are cause for concern. However, I still have Counsellor Troiand Captain Picard. The odds are that at least one of the procedureswill be successful. <eos> <bos> DATA: A neutrino pulse would send non-charged particles back up throughthe atmosphere and would be detectable by Geordi's Visor. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small shipis approaching. I believe Mister Orton has dropped his defence shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved,I am mainly conducting research into <eos> <bos> DATA: We are losing containment in the starboardnacelle tube. <eos> <bos> DATA: But are we doing a good thing now, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a clear memory of my journey. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was shortly before his death. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order toexperience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve themystery until then. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we are to investigate, sir, we must get closer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the moon's trajectory has movedpoint three percent. Point-four percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters. power levels rising. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to. <eos> <bos> DATA: Course set, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I, however, am not sure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's specs into the computer and ran acontrolled test on them. There was no improvement in engineperformance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sneezing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you have visual contact? <eos> <bos> DATA: We have found one such phenomenon on the planet's surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: I've been delivered here against my wishes. I would like to knowthe reason. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did, buthis wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with whatwould be best for her. <eos> <bos> DATA: He has a child's body, but we have found him to be much more. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report shows that it deliberatelyattacked. <eos> <bos> DATA: That explains the chroniton fields I am detecting in here now. For your own safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it could take more than two hours to reach the vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have none. The rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion,but I am picking up no evidence of a subspace field. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have lost helm control, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Her is in a state of ribocyatic flux. Her genetic codes arebeing re-sequenced and her cells are mutating as a result. At afundamental level, sir, she is no longer human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker just has been encased in some kind of energyfield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not really. My technique was to look for some thing, no matterhow small, that was common to both groups, and then to begin a processwhere one person or one group expresses themselves to each other. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented theEntity from <eos> <bos> DATA: Say nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: We appear to be caught in some kind of energy matrix. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Hull stress has returned tonormal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not precisely, Geordi. True fossilisation requires severalmillennia. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is present course, conn? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. You must now change the input matrix in my secondaryoptical port and then connect the conduit. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the energy flowing through that arc were interrupted by anonconductive material, it is likely the circuit would be broken. <eos> <bos> DATA: Disengaging safety systems. Going to fulltolerance levels, now. <eos> <bos> DATA: But, Geordi, your Starfleet specialty is antimatter power,dilithium regulators <eos> <bos> DATA: Affirmative, sir. But the colony's principal interest was science. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has disappeared once again, sir. I believe it may have beencoming to a halt. <eos> <bos> DATA: Despite your suggestion that I continue? <eos> <bos> DATA: Particle accelerators at full power. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears Counsellor was correct. Pierce was partiallytelepathic. His maternal grandmother was born on Betazed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have completed the analysis of the parent's coursethrough this system. <eos> <bos> DATA: One moment. Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are welcome. Doctor Crusher is expecting you in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering. To function aboard a starship,or in any human activity, you must learn to form relationships. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship appears to be regenerating. Perhaps this explains whythey have not taken notice of our presence. Their collective effort isbeing directed into repairing this vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is she all right, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: What choice of vocation would have met with your approval, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever thedebris is. <eos> <bos> DATA: We downloaded the Yamato log, and contained in the log was theprogramme. <eos> <bos> DATA: They seem to be re-programming the commands I have entered. <eos> <bos> DATA: Comic, continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You did ask me to be thorough. <eos> <bos> DATA: As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasinglydifficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. Theprobability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. Icame to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself downand start again. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors report the Hood isclosing on an intercept course at high warp. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which is the nearest Starfleet vessel? <eos> <bos> DATA: Instability. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an ice man. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe what could be termed the Manheim Effect is becomingmore pronounced. <eos> <bos> DATA: Clearance is granted. The shuttle is under way, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: They have restored the servo link to thecore. We can begin downloading the database. <eos> <bos> DATA: An interesting approach. He must have been planning toreintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan CentralInformation net. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, anyone who is willing to transport in this manner, wouldsuffer significant internal damage that could be detected. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: On what do you base that assumption? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have computed a possibility, Commander. Since even deep spacecontains trace gases, sir, a vessel in the Picard manoeuvre might seemto disappear, but our sensors could locate any sudden compression ofthose gases. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it is an emergent property. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr, you have made it clear that my presencedisturbs you. However, I do not see how we can achieve our task if youcontinue to ignore me. <eos> <bos> DATA: The fusion reactors that power the array areextremely unstable. There is a high risk of overload. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Proceeding immediately, sir. Data out. <eos> <bos> DATA: In fact, there have been many ages which have come and passedsince Makto. <eos> <bos> DATA: Strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive forapproximately three hundred years. The vessel is carrying variousunstable waste products. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is aware that our sensors are unable to track him, yet heseems to be purposely leaving a trail for us to follow. <eos> <bos> DATA: How did you come to that decision? <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor. I did not have a chance to apologise for my actions. <eos> <bos> DATA: In the game of poker, there is a moment when a player mustdecide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winninghand. This decision is based not only on the odds, but also on anappraisal of the man. Is he bluffing or does he have the cards? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I should attempt to communicate withthe Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am a Frenchman. <eos> <bos> DATA: Guinan! Excuse me. I must speak to youimmediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi has altered her appearance. <eos> <bos> DATA: We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by atleast seven percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have incorporated a micro-replication system into the devicein order to fashion tools. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is fortunate we were able to coordinateyour return on the Teldarian cruiser. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will enter the sun's photosphere in threeminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counterwith the el-Mitra Exchange, particularly since I have already takenboth your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your kingvulnerable. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was created on a planet <eos> <bos> DATA: The positronic matrix I designed for her was unstable. She onlylived a short time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, with all due respect, perhaps it would be better if youchoose another to serve as your First Officer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is expanding toward us, sir. It appears to be interfering withour engines, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimatelyfail. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating tricorder emissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It does not appear in any Federation charts of theCorridor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. The Romulan Information net employs aprogressive encryption lock. I have been unable to penetrate theirsecurity measures. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Yar? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. We must speak to Goshevenimmediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. Although Commander La Forge and I designedthe chip, Mister Crusher derived the equation governing its operation. <eos> <bos> DATA: We could then lower them in a controlled manner. <eos> <bos> DATA: It projects an image of someone the subject will trust, gets asmuch information as possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work. <eos> <bos> DATA: The stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three pointsix hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warp shell is definitely having an effect, sir. The anomalyis collapsing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons, highenergy X-ray lasers and merculite rockets. No match for the Enterprise,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: At maximum warp, in two years, seven months, three days,eighteen hours we would reach Starbase one eight five. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do not be apprehensive. Wes. I found the Academy examinationsquite elementary. <eos> <bos> DATA: All stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: I assume your hand print will open the door whether you areconscious or not. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would like to learn how to dance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to. I have been studying the Krocton segment, asyou asked, and have selected an appropriate site for our transport. <eos> <bos> DATA: Webster's Twenty Fourth Century Dictionary, Fifth Edition,defines an android as an automaton made to resemble a human being. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uh, oh. <eos> <bos> DATA: You consider it important to please humans? <eos> <bos> DATA: Abandon ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: It's never been done, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The translator is now offline, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Doctor, this is not ego. I am concerned about giving theCaptain unsound advice. <eos> <bos> DATA: It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance it islikely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, therecould be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cellmembrane, but. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not perceive your skills to be in doubt, Q. The Captain ismore concerned with your ability to interact successfully with hislittle trained minions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello, Timothy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unidentified ship heading toward us. Two life forms are aboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your empathic powers do not perceive anythingbecause as an android, I have no emotions. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply. It will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would need to see the programme schematic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The explosive was a triceron derivative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, how long has it been since you've seen a physician aboutyour Irumodic Syndrome? <eos> <bos> DATA: Hmm. Yes. I find it fascinating that yourfamily chose to drop the prefix Pel from your surname. It was myunderstanding that Pel Orton is a more noble appellation on Arkariathan simply Orton. <eos> <bos> DATA: At times, I too find it difficult to share my thoughts withothers. I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in amanner which humans can comprehend. But do I know that <eos> <bos> DATA: And when you check, I believe you will find that this poor soulis the victim's common-law wife, who has been dreading the release ofthis a vile and abusive man. <eos> <bos> DATA: We can initiate a brief, high intensity warp pulse from ourcurrent position. We should be able to attain sufficient velocity toenter the rift, beam the crew off the Fleming and exit without usingour warp engines. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in theE-band. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. May I inquire how your investigation is proceeding? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it was a beacon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensor readings show it to be a small class-nine vessel, probablyan interplanetary cargo ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was not meant as a joke. The tongue slipped. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the joke was not funny. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are back on course to Endicor. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear that you require a third party to intervene onyour behalf. I will be happy to speak to her. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe we have changed direction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Cardassian warship is moving on the Phoenix. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. We will attempt to expedite our work. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot, sir. The emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place. Our linkup signal cannot penetrate them. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is by no means certain, Doctor, but I was referring to you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, that would place the ore directly off the ship's starboardbow. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sound itself appears to have been real. However the acousticenergy does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voicecommunications sent at the time you heard it. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility, sir. I recommend we run a level onediagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is thecase. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain that either human or Bajoran rites are fitting,and I have researched the funerary customs of over five thousandcultures to no avail. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sustained. I will draw my own conclusions, if you do not mind. Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: To be precise, Commander, you ordered me toreach the Neutral Zone before it is too late. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, he may refer to an incident which occurred nine yearsago in the Maxia Zeta star system, in which an unidentified starship <eos> <bos> DATA: Radiation and pressure levels still stable. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is unlikely that they would receive our communication, sir. The Topin system contains an unstable protostar. It generatessignificant magnetoscopic interference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Accessing. Negative, sir. There is no record of any Federationvessel encountering anything remotely like this. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Captain's log, stardate 45351.9. Doctor Moseley hasmet with the colony leaders, who all agree they are willing to take therisk. <eos> <bos> DATA: Better is a highly subjective term. I do not, for example,possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do. <eos> <bos> DATA: All of which you will learn more about when the Captain hasapproved your being on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. The gratuity. Thank you for your assistance. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can not allow you to endanger your well-being. <eos> <bos> DATA: Technically, Geordi, we were not wrong. Serova's theories restedon assumptions which were unprovable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cake? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have had one hundred eleven dreams since I first discoveredthis programmenine months ago. In all of that time, I have never experienced suchstrange and disturbing imagery. I believe it was a nightmare. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, away team reporting in. LieutenantWorf standing by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Throughout history, many lovers have suffered the samedifficulty. Anne Boleyn was quite distressed that Henry the Eighthpreferred the company of his huntsmen over that of his wife. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. Placental barrier, maternal antibodies and amnioticfluids all serve as a filtration system. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is a biospectral analysis of the temporal aperture. Theorganic readings originated from these dark spots. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. It is as if he originates from adifferent quantum universe. <eos> <bos> DATA: The computer has configured the drilling pattern and specifieddepths. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on theplanet. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are many possible explanations. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show anestazine concentration seventy parts per millionwithin the cargo bays. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I am happy to do it. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have considered that possibility as well. It may also be thecase that every starship in the Federation is equipped with anartificial lifeform such as myself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sustained. The advocate will refrain from expressing personalaffections for her opponent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: Until then Commander Maddox, I will continue learning,changing, growing, and trying to become more than what I am. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I heard no fluctuations during the performance. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm afraid not. According to the Tkon use of galactic motionarystartime charts, after Bastu came Cimi, Xora, Makto <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the target was not the ship. The weapon was designed todrain the shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: I noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibellevels. <eos> <bos> DATA: Several, sir. The nearest is approximately three light hours fromour present position. <eos> <bos> DATA: I tried to caution you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready for departure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Botanists. Originally from the aquatic city New Martim Vaz inEarth's Atlantic Ocean. Residents of the Rana Four colony for fiveyears. You, ma'am, are eighty two years of age and a composer of Taoclassical music. You, sir, are eighty five years of age and aspecialist in symbiotic plant life. You have been married for fiftythree years. I memorised the colony register on the way to Rana Four,in the event that such information would be needed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor? Lal has narrowed the choices to four. Would you liketo see? <eos> <bos> DATA: That was not a request. I was simply talking to myself. A humanidiosyncrasy, triggered by fascination with a particular set of facts. Or sometimes brought about by senility. Or used as a means of weighinginformation before reaching a conclusion. Or, as a <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Otherwise their course and speed have been constant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hiya Doc. What's cooking? <eos> <bos> DATA: The contract agrees to deliver the people of Ventax Two into thepersonal servitude of Ardra after one thousand years of peace. I havecompared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet. Thelanguage of the agreement is correct in every detail, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have analysed the imaging logs. It appearsthe Array was reprogrammed to observe several Federation sites. <eos> <bos> DATA: Behind him and to the left, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. However, the sensor data gathered thus farsuggests a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties. <eos> <bos> DATA: Integrity field stress exceeding eighty twomillion kilodynes. Recommend immediate shutdown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event? <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engaging force fields, Captain. Transportersdown. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard theEnterprise that shed their skin in this fashion. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Juarez child? <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to away team. Please respond. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: For any event, there is an infinite number of possible outcomes. Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theoryin quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen, do happen inalternate quantum realities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: For what, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, there are other ways to challenge oneself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I will work on staying within myself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Scott. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no records of any negative thoughts about you. Hispersonal journals indicated that he was proud that you were such a finescientist. <eos> <bos> DATA: As do I, sir. Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shipwide life support failure in fifteen seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The rupture is beginning to close, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, given the EM field properties of this moon, I recommend asearch pattern beginning in the southern polar region. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no sign of the freighter, sir. Weare the only ship in the area. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Set course three five zero mark two one five and engageat warp eight point five. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields reduced to one fifth intensity. <eos> <bos> DATA: But there is a problem here, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is nothing left of OutpostDelta Zero Five. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, Commander. At Starfleet Academy. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was only trying to carry out his wishes. I just wanted to keepmy promise to him. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus. The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross theborder. <eos> <bos> DATA: Still nothing, Captain. I've conducted a full sensor sweep out toone light year from the Pasteur. No temporal anomalies, no particlefluctuations, nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: As Doctor Pulaski would at this juncture, no doubt, remind us,life is rarely fair. <eos> <bos> DATA: But that would not affect the engines in any way. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there has been an incident. <eos> <bos> DATA: Any further delay would put us all at grave risk. <eos> <bos> DATA: We were heading for a medical facility. I was taking the boy'sbrother to Sickbay and <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to thedistress call. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I have completed level one computer diagnostics. There areno malfunctions. <eos> <bos> DATA: By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotionsare within my grasp. Perhaps I will experience other emotions as timegoes by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing so far, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then it is perfect timing, Doctor. What better occasion tointegrate my results into your study? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that the Cardassians were specifically interestedin capturing Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Extremely rude behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Recent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive thepassage of time. For example, I have often heard people comment thattime seems to pass more slowly in one instance, or more quickly inanother. In reality, the actual passage of time remains fixed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despitewhat happened to her, I still have that wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have cleared the asteroids, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no other emotions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> DATA: Five card draw, deuces wild. <eos> <bos> DATA: The storm is beginning to subside, Captain. We should have a window in less than an hour. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would consider them insignificant. <eos> <bos> DATA: All of the ship's records are available to you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is possible. I may also have been inadvertently responsiblefor the unexplained appearances of the number three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: These nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control anddefensive systems. We believe this is why the ship jumped to warp. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. We speak often. It is a young female, humanoid. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is often the case that children learn languages more easilythan adults. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ishara. What are you doing? The fusion generator is overloading. You are attempting to disable the defence system. For what reason? Wehave rescued the crewmen. <eos> <bos> DATA: Forty-one seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reconfigure photon torpedo warhead yields. Set for high energyburst level six. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. It is possible that those are memories of my childhood. Andof Mrs Soong. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you will find all of the missing items in the vessel,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information inmy tricorder, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: As am I. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The system's sun has entered a period of severe flareactivity. <eos> <bos> DATA: That while I believe it is possible to download the informationcontained in the positronic brain, I do not think you have acquired theexpertise necessary to preserve the essence of those experiences. Thereis an ineffable quality to memory which I do not believe can surviveyour procedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly, as soon as my work here is completed. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have some doubts about the value of human customs in this. My brother! <eos> <bos> DATA: I could go over it with you now. It would not require more thantwo hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have to beam back and get them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Atmospheric contaminants have dropped to less than one part pertrillion. The ecosystem has been restored to its natural state. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: Take my Worf. Please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Permission granted. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only a layer of dust. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, please access all volcanic andtectonic plate activity in Drema Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have further information regarding the tornado that killedAmanda Rogers' parents. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot be hurt. But she can. <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing three three sevenmark ten. It has disappeared again, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not nervous. I am confused. <eos> <bos> DATA: They have received the message, Captain, but are ignoring it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are being hailed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Good for you. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I was playing only for a standoff, a draw. While Kolrami wasdedicated to winning, I was able to pass up obvious avenues ofadvancement and settle for a balance. Theoretically, I should be ableto challenge him indefinitely. <eos> <bos> DATA: No one regrets that necessity more than myself. You do understandmy reasons? <eos> <bos> DATA: There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, but the computer can replicate such an instrument. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard? I have amalfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is identical to what happened to the outposts along theNeutral Zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has restrictions. The information from Geordi's visor is socomplex it is difficult to encode. Therefore the signal breaks downeasily. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed another full scan of thearea, sir. There is no further indication of the anomaly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bearing one eight seven mark four. I am unable to determine ourdestination, however we are heading away from the Mekorda sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain, sir. However, joined together they would make arectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty one square metres. Ifput end to end vertically, they would make a pole forty four metreshigh, or two of twenty two. <eos> <bos> DATA: I thought it was a topic you were interested in. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by to energise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the aliens have disappeared, and sohas the shuttle. <eos> <bos> DATA: I estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty five minutes toproperly configure the torpedo. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish I could feel it with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have compiled all available records pertaining toJason Vigo's criminal record, and <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating interface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tomorrow will be your first day of school, Lal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Oh, you are early. Just a moment please. <eos> <bos> DATA: The primary plasma system does not indicate apower drain from any of the transporters. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have tried other stimuli, but they have been unsuccessful. Iunderstand your objections, but it is my life and I have a right torisk it if I choose. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where are the Bynars? <eos> <bos> DATA: I anticipated that diversionary tactic based on his pattern todate. We are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven metresin length and three metres in diameter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shall I, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal is realising she is not the same as other children. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifteen thousand, three hundred eleven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no life signs aboard, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, that is a flower, Lal. Inhale. <eos> <bos> DATA: Heading, Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> DATA: I was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk Iremoved from the module's computer. Her name is Clare Raymond, agethirty five, occupation homemaker. Must be some kind of constructionwork. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ten seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have complete confidence in your ability to representmy interests. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to themicroorganism is. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain keysystems until primary control is restored. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scout ship is severely damaged, Captain. Engines inoperative,shields are down. <eos> <bos> DATA: I did, but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage. <eos> <bos> DATA: Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not familiar with <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Pressure wave harmonics dispersing. Temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so. I will make another attempt. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue. <eos> <bos> DATA: What do you think it is going to be? <eos> <bos> DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across thespectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifty two stars sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD. Itcorrelates with the debris we found. Colonel S. Richey. Rest in peace,Colonel. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spotlacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses tomy commands. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twentythree minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have thecuriosity of humans, but there are questions I will never have theanswer to. What is it like to laugh, or cry, or to experience any humanemotions. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps. After I painted the smoke, it then occurred to me topaint a bird's wing. I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birdsflying in formation. An individual feather. If the image of a bird isrelated to my vision, I do not understand how. I am left with more of amystery than ever. Geordi, I would like to recreate the experimentwhich caused my initial shut down. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must decline. <eos> <bos> DATA: In both cases, the time distortions occurredalong the same continuum as a preview or a reprise of a specific pointin time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lieutenant CommanderData. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have not observed anyone else on board consulting you abouttheir procreation, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not wish to frighten you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Something to write home about. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escapepod. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beam is scanning the shield's perimeter. The probe isemitting an unusual particle stream. <eos> <bos> DATA: And was the sole member of the committee to oppose my entrance onthe grounds that I was not a sentient being. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly. There is a great deal ofinterference, but I am getting some readings. This is very unusual. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Direct hit, sir. Moderate damage to their aft shield generators. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most humanoids have the potential to be irrational. Perhaps youshould attempt to access that part of your psyche. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Cardassian ships are changing course, sir. They are crossingthe border. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. If I could further scan the aperture, it might bepossible to <eos> <bos> DATA: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivatedland is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few peopleengaged in agricultural activities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hull breach is imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would not be advisable. You must cease your descent. <eos> <bos> DATA: The tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket ofour universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard is not satisfied with KiMendrossen's assurances that the Ambassador is in good health. Do youconsider Sarek capable of carrying out his mission? <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I have completed the adjustments on the interface. I am nowwaiting for Commander Riker to finish moving the probe. Do you need tobe comforted? <eos> <bos> DATA: After analysing the sensor logs of theBrittain and the Enterprise, as well as the data from the last seriesof probes, I conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupturein space, into which energy is absorbed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal suffered complete neural system failureat thirteen hundred hours. I have deactivated the unit. <eos> <bos> DATA: I expected nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not appear so. Computer, has anyone been in my quartersin the last twelve hours other than Commander La Forge and myself? <eos> <bos> DATA: I see. So the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning inzero gravity environment, coupled with the adverse effect it would haveon the psychological well being of the average human male, is whatmakes this anecdote so amusing. Yes. Very humorous indeed. Hysterical,in fact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I can explain if you would just give me a moment. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg. I looked down at hisbody. I felt something. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our present speed of warp four, sixteen hours, forty fourminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. <eos> <bos> DATA: One enemy target destroyed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, it is important. Very. Eight weeks ago I received atransmission, a simple four word message, 'Is anybody out there?' Ianswered it. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is alive, sir, but just barely. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must say goodbye now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Structural integrity of the barge has been compromised. Disintegration is continuing. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable toblock it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have reviewed and stored five distinct signinglanguages. Here is an example of the first. This is blue. This is ablue ocean. This is a blue ocean at sunset. This is two people walkingalong the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is two happy people inlove walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is twopeople <eos> <bos> DATA: I can hear you coming, Captain. My ears are better than theaverage dog's, you know. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I will delete the appropriate programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two of the silver-grey entities areapproaching it. They have released the forcefield. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot say. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there any indication that Gosheven has changed his position? <eos> <bos> DATA: These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is anancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where CaptainPicard was killed were also Romulan in origin. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. The debris consists primarily of duraniumand polycomposite fragments which suggest a ship. Furthermore, thefield contains sufficient mass to account for the Fleming. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. Please arrange to take Kivas Fajo into custody oncharges of murder, kidnapping, theft. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is for your trouble. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a skill my programme has never mastered. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Quite correct. Then may I ask another question after this one? <eos> <bos> DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, you are putting me in a difficultposition. Please, cease your descent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certain cyanoacrylates. <eos> <bos> DATA: The problem's originating in Sickbay. There has been anunauthorized access into the computer's bio-imaging systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Borg are in pursuit. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish, Counsellor. Check. <eos> <bos> DATA: Whatever it is, it could be what they are covering up, and thereason someone killed Malencon. Captain's log, supplemental. On my order, Data'sstartling discovery of a possible life form has been beamed aboard sothat its true nature might be uncovered. But unlike life on Earth andelsewhere, it appears to be completely inorganic. <eos> <bos> DATA: But no one has bet. <eos> <bos> DATA: So it seems. <eos> <bos> DATA: By order of Starfleet, I hereby take command of this vessel. Please note the time and date in the ship's log. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed, there are many races that are not empathicallydetectable. The Breen, the Ferengi, the <eos> <bos> DATA: You share all of those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you shouldtry to build on your similarities. <eos> <bos> DATA: No life signs, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir, but it will take some time to decipher thepatterns. <eos> <bos> DATA: It sounds intriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. The body Geordi discovered. <eos> <bos> DATA: Medical assistance to Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment withnon-relevant conversation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Blame you? <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most of these are ordinary G-type stars. This would appear to bea neutron star, possibly a pulsar. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are not my mother. That is the appropriate response for yourstatement that I am behaving foolishly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundredmetres wide. We would need to cross-connect six units and align them sothe fields overlap. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eightyseven million years. <eos> <bos> DATA: Set the pattern enhancers around whateverobject you wish to transport. I will proceed to the transporter roomand begin modifications. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you believe that I lured the Entity here? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system. Perhaps weshould try to pinpoint the exact moment when events becamediscontinuous. Do you remember the first change? <eos> <bos> DATA: A subspace phase inverter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Activating the remote sensors. Initiating interface now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, I am capable of distinguishing over one hundred andfifty simultaneous compositions, but in order to analyse theaesthetics, I try to keep it to ten or less. <eos> <bos> DATA: What happened to her? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra Two by a malevolent entity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: We are on the Bridge of the Enterprise. My cat is present, mypotted plant, and my paintings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, readings correspond with the findings of the probe. Nosigns of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain. Geordi, please return power to thecontrol console in this room. I wish to reactivate theprogramme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I had been your biological offspring, would you have left meon Omicron Theta? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronicsubprocessor. But I am fine. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. She is in grave danger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Estimate intercept in three minutes. Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. While en route tothe Endicor system, we have encountered a Federation shuttlecraft,which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There are no indicationsof where it came from or how it got out here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal, this is Geordi La Forge. <eos> <bos> DATA: You wished to see me, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we will need to reach our transport site in fourteenminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: He just collapsed, sir. Captain's log, stardate 42823.2. We're departingfrom Starbase Seven Three to investigate the source of the mysteriousdistress signal. Meanwhile, my Security Officer remains in Sickbay,where Doctor Pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Foley discovered this in the pond. Thespecies is Zan Periculi. It is not indigenous to Betazed, but to LappaFour. A Ferengi world. <eos> <bos> DATA: Or the oligarchy on Atifs Four, whichrequire a young <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, Chancellor Alrik is waiting to receive you inholodeck seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, request permission to investigate this vehicle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. The subspace signal configuration is unchanged. What iscausing the increased neural activity is unclear. <eos> <bos> DATA: That sounds reasonable, sir. If they choose to go, I would bewilling to release the transporter lock out. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is highly unusual. The crew is not at battle stations. Theship is on evacuation alert. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be awelcome diversion after a long assignment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am initiating a subspace scan to search fortemporal anomalies on or off the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Target is destroyed. <eos> <bos> DATA: With regard to romantic relationships, there is no real me. I amdrawing upon various cultural and literary sources to help define myrole. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, if Koral wishes to contest our actions he can file aprotest with the Judge Advocate General's office. Bring the shuttleaboard. Then you and Doctor Crusher can begin the inspection. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, you are fifteen minutes early. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, but was his modus operandi not dissimilar? Worthinvestigating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. We are copying records for Federation inspectionpursuant to their application for admittance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly. But as you may recall on several occasions, we havewitnessed the Borg removing key circuits from injured comrades, nodoubt separating them from the group consciousness. <eos> <bos> DATA: A celebration? <eos> <bos> DATA: And I have studied your design for the particle fountain. I findthe concept to be highly innovative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing sir. Nothing at all. <eos> <bos> DATA: The asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite, which isinterfering with our scanners. I am also detecting traces of kephneum,a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being. It is likelythe asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: A transporter would leave residual ionizationin the air. Our tricorder readings found no trace after the incident. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Chief. <eos> <bos> DATA: All navigational systems confirm we are at warp six on course,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our present speed, we will arrive at theAtalia system in thirty seven hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eightysix point five percent efficiency. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Noonien Soong. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are detecting a ship, <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, are you implying the exocomp exhibited some form ofself-preservation? <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is alive, sir, but just barely. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin samples from yourfather. They showed improvement, so I administered this to him. He isnow recovering. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. However, I would prefer to make certainthere are no anomalies in my neural net. <eos> <bos> DATA: He will try to delay until a rescue attempt is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may be experiencing the initial stages of yourtransformation. Early primates were often prey to larger carnivores. Asa result, their instincts probably included a heightened sense ofawareness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cargo bay four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you are referring to the rescue of Maid Marian fromNottingham Castle? Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. She was especially close to Commander Riker and LieutenantWorf. And to myself. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Look at his shoes. He's more a convict, released today fromDartmoor prison. He spent the day in a tavern consuming large quantities of gin with hiskiller, who followed him to this spot and waited over there until thevictim slipped into a drunken stupor. Then, out of fear, motivated onlyby self-protection, strangled him. There is your killer, Inspector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eighteen hours, seven minutes, and ten seconds, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only afacsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you know, Captain, we are looking for aphenomenon that reoccurs every five hours, twenty minutes and threeseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor. However. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you know the nature of Doctor Manheim's work? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The drag coefficient is still present, but it has stabilised. <eos> <bos> DATA: Positive indication of armed photontorpedoes, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do, sir. She was frightened and did not wish to be left alone <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. Activating Bussard collectors. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am capable of that function when it is expected of me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Full ambassadorial status, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This isthe third unstable wormhole I have passed through during my time withStarfleet. The first was aboard the Trieste <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard, do you have any further evidence to presentbefore I render judgment? <eos> <bos> DATA: A small force field containing xenon or another inert gas couldbe placed over the incision site. The explosive could possibly bedisarmed at the same time it is removed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds to impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Warp core to ninety percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: To prepare, I have scanned all available literature on parenting. There seems to be much confusion on this issue. One traditionaldoctrine insists, spare the rod and spoil the child, suggesting apunitive approach. While another more liberalattitude would allow the child enormous freedom. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reporting as ordered, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: He seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude. <eos> <bos> DATA: Message from the saucer module, sir. It will arrive here in fiftyone minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Her environment, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. We are ready <eos> <bos> DATA: Her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolising bothwater and air, and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes. Ibelieve she is amphibian, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was in your service record. Awarded first prize tap and jazzcompetition, Saint Louis Academy. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. I do not have access to the containment field. You willhave to establish a new link. Locate the conduit, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They arereinforcing the tetryon emissions. They appear to be counter-acting thegraviton pulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is my understanding that the item selected should reflect thepersonality of whoever is giving it. This does not remind me of you. Have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, if a face to face negotiation would be helpful, I wouldlike to volunteer myself as a conduit. <eos> <bos> DATA: The message does not elaborate. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. I will try that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> DATA: The tone of Commander Riker's voice makes me suspect that heis not serious about finding Ambassador T'Pel charming. My experiencesuggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says. irony is a form of expression I have not yet been able to master. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have analysed over four thousand different religious andphilosophical systems, as well as over two hundred psychologicalschools of thought, in an effort to understand what happened. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is the only obvious choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Using conventional means, that would be true. However, I suggestwe piggy-back our signal on Romulan subspace transmissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. But I do not agree with Talur's assessment. Although I dohave gaps in my memory, I know that fire is not an element. <eos> <bos> DATA: Multiple hits, sir. Power failure in forward shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: This would appear to be manual override. <eos> <bos> DATA: Away team reporting in, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Setting a course for Starbase two twenty. Sir, as my final dutyas Acting Captain, I order you to bed. I shall do the same for allpersonnel. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Then he wishes to relocate us? <eos> <bos> DATA: Chief. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing. I willlearn them all. Computer, show me gestural language designation M nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. Atthis rate, the sector will be completely filled with Enterprises withinthree days. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Minimum for our needs, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it is clear the Borg are eitherunwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, is Geordi well enough to answer somequestions? <eos> <bos> DATA: Is this level sufficient? Geordi? Geordi, do you hear me? <eos> <bos> DATA: I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not ordering him to do anything. I am merely trying topersuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. Do you believemy suggested course of action should be followed? <eos> <bos> DATA: If that were the purpose, there would be evidence of a moresophisticated monitoring system. These containers were designed solelyfor refrigeration. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two years, one month and twelve days. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly thirteen hours, nine minutes, twenty two seconds, threehundred fifty <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because of the dense gravity of the pulsar. <eos> <bos> DATA: In human parlance, I do not believe I can getthe job done. My training has prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact I am proving to be <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Tainer, I get the impression you are trying to spare myfeelings. I assure you that is not necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, the control is still yours. <eos> <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: No. It is not that. I have reason to believe the exocomps arealive. Captain's log, stardate 46316.6. I have summonedthe senior staff in order to discuss Commander Data's theory that theexocomps are a life form. Doctor Farallon has attended onlyreluctantly. <eos> <bos> DATA: In our previous encounter, Danar employed a strategy ofmisdirection in an attempt to gain his objective. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstanddebate? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you had better step out of the way. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run uncheckedthrough the entire ship. Attempts to develop an inoculants have so farended in failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has Bridge command pendingyour return, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: When one of my friends is distraught, I have learnt that thethoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your sanity is not in question. However, your evaluation of theavailable information is biased. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. <eos> <bos> DATA: Velocity is one hundred thirty five metres per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: One could speculate that the E-band is being used for some formof covert communication. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: A compound I made which will neutralise the particles that aremaking you ill. Swallow this. I must administer this to everyone in thevillage, but I do not think they will trust me after what happened toSkoran. <eos> <bos> DATA: To what end? <eos> <bos> DATA: Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated responseto a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will join you in a moment, Geordi. Data out. Lieutenant LaForge requires my assistance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two million seven hundred thousand light years. <eos> <bos> DATA: I found it, sir, two light years away. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Anyon emissions are harmless. Pleasebegin immediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nor do I. <eos> <bos> DATA: With the advocate's withdrawal, the contract is hereby dissolved. This arbitration is adjourned. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Twelve point three million. Perhaps I will bet sevenhundred thousand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I did not succeed in my efforts. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is, in essence, an eruption of anti-time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. Lieutenant Barclay appears inordinately preoccupied withhis physiological condition. I have seen him check his pulse rate, aswell as his visual acuity several times over the last twenty minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Human interpersonal relationships are more complex. Yourexperiences may not have adequately prepared you. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: The Koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiledin a war that lasted for several generations. Our best evidenceindicates they destroyed themselves. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energyreserves. Compensating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Admiral is definitely incorrect. The tunnelschematics we have show this to be a dead end. It was sealed off twoyears ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: You know of the Sheliak threat. Starfleet wishes to evacuate youfor your own protection. Yet Gosheven has decided otherwise. That ishis right, And I will not waste time trying to reverse that decision. Iadmire your conviction in the face of certain defeat. Though doomed,your effort will be valiant. And when you die, you will die for landand honour. Your children will understand that they are dying for aworthy cause. Long after the battle is over, their courage will beremembered and extolled. <eos> <bos> DATA: The anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter. It isa highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximatelythe same energy output as ten G type stars. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to historical records. This will be the firstopportunity for a Federation team <eos> <bos> DATA: There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I amdisconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, is it possible there are areas inside the rift which arestable, where we can safely use our warp engines? <eos> <bos> DATA: I could not have succeeded without your support and insight. I amgrateful for your assistance. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have done as Captain Picard suggested. I have tried to explorethe images. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scan of grid one five seven is complete. I ammoving to grid one five eight. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing so far, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of theEnterprise. We will need a variable phase inverter, to align the powerfrom the Enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will be removing that equipment to my quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would have thought a telepath would be more discreet, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is cellular peptide cake. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of that, Doctor. However, I can see no otherreasonable course of investigation available to us. And we may not havemuch time. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. It is empirical data. I believe the fragments were originallyplaced in this container to protect people from accidental exposure. The word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of themetal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of theStargazer. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittentsystem failures and power surges as a result. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but ratheras a message. <eos> <bos> DATA: The two radiation events aboard the Enterprise occurred fivehours, twenty minutes and three seconds apart. The science stationexploded yesterday at almost four times that interval. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, that chaos when we were studying it in the lab must havebeen the energy surge of a reproductive cycle. It is now a colony of single cells which organize as a computer. Andlike any computer <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore! <eos> <bos> DATA: Voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in manycultures. <eos> <bos> DATA: She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to othermembers of the crew who have attempted to care for her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the shuttle has been launched. <eos> <bos> DATA: The energy readings appear to be originating approximately twometres below the surface. I believe they are concentrated within thisburial site. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately ninety million kilometres from the star'sphotosphere. I am reading a great deal of surface instability. It maybe <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, another forty-one minutes will seethe information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us. <eos> <bos> DATA: The remaining cases of hytritium are nowbeing loaded. PICARD <eos> <bos> DATA: Like a full collapse, sir? Any stellar material it threw this waywe could still outrun on half impulse power. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, good morning, sir. Ship status is <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. We've been able to verify that thesecoils are the logs of the Promellian captain, but most of them havedecayed and cannot be repaired. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker's easy going manner and sense of humour isfascinating to me. I believe it to be one reason he is so popular amongthe crew. It may also be partly responsible for his success in mattersof love. There may be a correlation between humour and sex. The needfor more research is clearly indicated. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are identical to the coil we found earlier, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Distribution nodes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am picking up molecular displacementtraces. That suggests movement through this area during the last tenhours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Confirm. We are on that heading, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are clearing the phenomenon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently, that is not correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hull temperature rising. Two thousanddegrees. <eos> <bos> DATA: A Klingon fly, half the size of an Earth mosquito, with no stingand a buzzing sound like this. <eos> <bos> DATA: Good afternoon. I would like to speak to Guinan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I have no human instinct per se, I cannot advise you,Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do nothing. It may yet be possible to salvage the situation. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is also a subplot about an older manconspiring with a younger woman to murder her husband. She issquandering her inheritance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Although I am technically proficient, according to my fellowperformers, I lack soul. <eos> <bos> DATA: The repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern would imply amodified <eos> <bos> DATA: The Federation abandoned its research in the field because thetechnology was found to be unreliable, as well as energy intensive. <eos> <bos> DATA: To do so would have been pointless. All things must pass. May Igo now, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: However, I could be in error. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will raise you three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eighty seven percent Saurian Brandy. Targ milk and Danisian meadcomprise the rest. There is an unusually high concentration of fructosecompounds and monosaccharides. <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, Lore was responsible for <eos> <bos> DATA: A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximatelyfour point three five six solar masses. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: I have invited you here to meet someone. <eos> <bos> DATA: You want to know if I had some special technique? <eos> <bos> DATA: Bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period. It is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. I will need to run a diagnostic to becertain. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The patterns are clearly artificial. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is on a secure channel, sir. In your ready room? <eos> <bos> DATA: We have passed through the wave, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you're referring to the first productionmodel automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent ModelA might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong'srevised prototype. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am already listed in several bio-mechanical texts, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears he has us both. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I must apologise for my inadvertent misconduct towardyou. <eos> <bos> DATA: The lateral EM scanners register radiation levels indicative of aclass-M planet. Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: In theory it could operate over several light years. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Commander. Apparently the probe has discovered. Astonishing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eleven dead, eight more unaccounted for, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where is your mother? <eos> <bos> DATA: We agree. <eos> <bos> DATA: Angel One is a class M planet, sir, supporting carbon based floraand fauna, sparsely populated with intelligent life forms. It issimilar in technological development to mid-twentieth century Earth. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving relayed sensor data from the VegaProbe, including visuals. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans. However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, thecomputer in my quarters has an independent processing and memorystorage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. I will be on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboardinertial damping system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, can this be another me? Or possibly my brother? <eos> <bos> DATA: Moriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept onlyhis commands. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may leave whenever you choose. I will send out a message whenI am ready to go. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our Betazoid Counsellor is often aware of things beyond ourperceptive abilities. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise is at impulse speed. You are cleared for takeoff. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be an incorrect assumption. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi? What is wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may bediluted, but it should still have enough potency to work. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the offspring is emitting high frequency radiotransmissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would seem to be a necessary first step. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is slowing and is holding its position, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why would we do that? <eos> <bos> DATA: What is your position? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. They are fully integrated components. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sarjenka, this is Data. Respond please. <eos> <bos> DATA: The use of gestures and hand signals pre dates the spoken word inmost cultures. The major exception being the Leyrons of Malkus Nine whoactually developed a written language first. Computer, continuepresentation. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. <eos> <bos> DATA: And that is the first and most important aspect of anyrelationship. Counsellor, it took me only moments to learn signlanguage. It will take them months. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reason for failure? <eos> <bos> DATA: There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty todefeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which Ipossess. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer,recognise Picard, Jean-Luc. Alpha Two clearance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, a conflict has started between theplanetary evolution team and the stellar physicists. Each wishes to bethe first to use the thermal imaging array. <eos> <bos> DATA: I fold. <eos> <bos> DATA: That bearing is almost directly along our planned course, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not from this distance, sir. I am also detecting an ion trailintersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet typesix shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> DATA: Rebuttal? <eos> <bos> DATA: And how is that accomplished? <eos> <bos> DATA: The computer has completed its analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Search pattern has been input, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. I am an android. I am Lieutenant Commander Dataof the Federation Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: A magnetic storage bay. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died. Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life formswithin the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one weobserved in Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Garvin is correct. You agreed on twenty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors cannottrack them, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The first and third E-band blips were clearly generated on boardthe ship. The second came from the planet surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may enter now. LAFORGE <eos> <bos> DATA: In a manner of speaking. It is a crystalline composite ofsilicon, beryllium, Carbon seventy, and <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The fragmentation effect continues along a heading of two sevenzero mark one five. <eos> <bos> DATA: All sections secure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have recently had an unusual experience, which might bedescribed as a vision. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mark zero. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Reverse power. Decelerating. <eos> <bos> DATA: In disrupting the detection net, the Romulans may have caused aresidual tachyon signature to form around their own ships. <eos> <bos> DATA: I shall miss you, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading. It appears to be aneutrino emission with no visible source. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must get him to the runabout. <eos> <bos> DATA: My silence is not by choice, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We've been scanning the area since entering the system, but ourreadings are being disrupted. <eos> <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigationalsystems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can well imagine. The light in this room would make colourselection exceptionally problematic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which do you believe, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are more alike than unlike, my dear Captain. I have pores. Humans have pores. I have fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. Mychemical nutrients are like your blood. If you prick me, do I not leak? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what wenormally think of as self-identity. Their ability to abstract is highlyunusual. They seem to communicate through narrative imagery byreference to the individuals and places which appear in theirmytho-historical accounts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently, the putative malfunctions were carefully programmedinto their ship's computer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Request permission to accompany you, sir. I am totally versed inthe genre of the period. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision. I will try. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My medals. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are still no life form readings coming from the vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is told by nefarious lothario MickeyD, who appears only at the climax to carry out the cold-blooded murderof the hotel bellboy. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will attempt to do so. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The boys appear to have reconciled their differences. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is so noted, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is the source? <eos> <bos> DATA: You would be better off without my help. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving <eos> <bos> DATA: The colony's aqueduct system is functioningnormally, as are the communication relays. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander. Sensors are detecting highly acceleratedinterstellar gases. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which makes it important to know which of these weapons are to beused. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a reminder of friendship and service. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors can locate no debris from the Romulan ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps, for humans, old things represent a tie to the past. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The wormhole appears to have been a local phenomenon. <eos> <bos> DATA: All systems functioning normally, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The effect from the wormhole was rather intense. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inform me when you are ready. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, prepare to drop shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot allow that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, may I speak to you alone? <eos> <bos> DATA: Please clarify. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not mean to belittle your condition. I understand yourdilemma. But I am curious. Myprogramme can be altered. Yours cannot? <eos> <bos> DATA: What has happened here? Doctor. Doctor Soong. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor Troi, what is it? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to theexplosion, it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, it appears to be working. Theanomaly is beginning to collapse. I think that <eos> <bos> DATA: With your permission, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: A gift from you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: It makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this one is still alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They aredesigned to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns. Once they arein place, I will destroy the existing brain cells. We'll see if theartificial neural network is able to take over your cognitivefunctions. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. However, the console displays indicate a power transfer inprogress between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship at the moment timedecelerated. That is why there is a second beam between the two ships. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. One hour recess is granted. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experiencedhad an unexpected effect on the ship's systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliverthis. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were correct to suspect him, sir. But he is not from thefuture, he is from the past. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I am not. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. First I must isolate the cause of the illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. I find it interesting how much importance humans place oncelebrating the day of their birth. A day they cannot possiblyremember. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will start my calibrations, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And a very good job of it I did of it, too. <eos> <bos> DATA: Both the Intrepid and Romulan logs show a series of distresssignals from Khitomer. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have a few words to say, sir. Just look at that face. The face of a thinker. A warrior. A man for allseasons. Yes, Ira Graves was all that and more. But he was not perfect. Perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless. He cared toomuch for his fellow man, with nary a thought for himself. A man oflimitless accomplishments, and unbridled modesty. I can safely say thatto know him was to love him. And to love him was to know him. Those whoknew him, loved him, while those who did not know him, loved him fromafar. <eos> <bos> DATA: She would have to be armed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos> <bos> DATA: The field continues to drop, sir. Collapse is imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was aware of that. But are you aware that Tyrellia is one ofseven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. And? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not understand how, but it is asking me if I wasconstructed for information exchange. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is projecting an energy field. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. But my programme does include military strategy. That is howI was able to anticipate your final tactic and capture you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apology is not necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not saying that at all. I merely state a possiblealternative explanation. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. That is not possible. The signals had to be transmittedwithin close proximity to the visor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I said, that is one of them, is it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Paxans then take the ship out of their territory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with theoriginal circuitry. <eos> <bos> DATA: And of more immediate importance is your ability to work withingroups. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Good night, Captain. Sleep well, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We were attempting to trace the source of themalfunction when it attacked me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. Do you need totalk about it? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am establishing the interface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This houseoriginally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It'sbecome the traditional residence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The logs indicate Professor Galen visited an unexploredstar system, Ruah Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally andphysically. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two hours, forty minutes and three seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle has been hit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you do not believe she should know the truth? <eos> <bos> DATA: Jump. <eos> <bos> DATA: With the Enterprise temporarily protected, I revived thecrew. <eos> <bos> DATA: All stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story istrue. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have not fully assimilated its impact. I would prefer to studythe images further before discussing them. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have bypassed the primary system. <eos> <bos> DATA: He would not move to a polar orbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from theleakage in the drive system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath, thechances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecularpatterns themselves. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Counsellor. I look forward to our next meeting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Theoretically, sir, it should work. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: All the probe's systems are functioning perfectly. <eos> <bos> DATA: At this rate of acceleration, fifteen minutes forty seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I do not have a mother. <eos> <bos> DATA: Except that I am not programmed to kill. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not remember being in an accident. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarialsituation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir. I am content to stand. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you mean a Tarellian vessel, sir, it is. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the starsystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are several cultures in this sector with extremely similaretymological histories. For example <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks, sir. Repair time, three point six days. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that Icould also taste my dessert. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our flight path is changing. Right ten point seven degrees, sir. Insufficient to clear the photosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: How many? How many more accidents? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have not told Lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate. Idid not wish it to discourage her. Perhaps this was an error ofjudgement. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, I must join Commander La Forge in Engineering. If youwill excuse me. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask the purpose of your journey? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations,direct insubordination is a court martial offence. But I will notrelease the transporter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Pakleds did hear our little fiction about Geordi's weaponsknowledge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise. Commander Data ready to beam aboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts. Itis similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since you seemed to know so much about Captain Picard and theship, I assumed that you would. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: But what does one do if he has no instinct and intuition? <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently, their ship is apparently quite fragile. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Initiating ionisation field pulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Access faster. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to do so. However, I must ask you to stop yourexperiment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, that is true. There will be no one left alive to remember. <eos> <bos> DATA: Those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish frombackground noise. That is why I am boosting the power. <eos> <bos> DATA: Power has been restored, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: External temperature is zero point nine million Kelvins andrising. Radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer activate automatic helm control. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Patch him through, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, on screen. Alien vessel approaching at half impulse,sir. Heading zero five one mark one one four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Intensified scan shows their guidance system to be perfectlyintact, as is their power generator. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a Code Forty Seven, sir. Starfleet emergency frequency. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Power emissions do not match any known radiationpatterns. We have not encountered this technology before, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Freeze programme. Thank you, sir. I plan to study theperformances of Olivier, Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> DATA: I said I cannot operate <eos> <bos> DATA: Go to science station two on the main Bridge. Use a lateralsensor array to get a more precise reading. I will modify an anyonemitter to eliminate the fields once they've been isolated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Another weapon has been launched, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are receiving, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his ownemotional awareness to understand the character he plays. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula. My calculations indicate the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabusystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have its call sign now, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes are far superior to humanbiological eyes. True? Then why are not all human officers required tohave their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants? I see. It is precisely because I am not human. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallicpendant and hitting the cloth. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hostile's velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall Iput them on the main viewer? <eos> <bos> DATA: Once I have adjusted the forcefield, I will no longer be visible,Commander. I have taken steps, however, to ensure that you will stillbe able to hear me. If you would assist me in a test of the comm. system. My voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phaseadjustment. That should allow me to maintain verbal contact. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are caught in an energy damping field, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Difficult to make a judgment, sir, based on the absence ofinformation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I am not ill? <eos> <bos> DATA: I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are a fine debater, sir. It is a pity you have used yourverbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your owngreed. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion. And it isexpanding. <eos> <bos> DATA: And fifty seven seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is not my fault. They told me I was notsupposed to be up here. They should not have done that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. I have located a large concentration of nodes behindthis wall. They appear to be connected directly to the holodeck's mainpower coupling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shuttle launch sequence confirmed. DepartingEnterprise in exactly three seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but since the illness struck all three in a relatively shortperiod of time, it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent andunusual. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, there is a sixty percent chance you will not survive theprocedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Warp one point five, sir, which is what my instruments have readall along. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Geordi, I am still confused by Chief O'Brien's reaction thismorning. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm attemptin to neutralise your pain receptors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. Doctor. I am honoured by your presence, but may Isuggest you attend the second concert. <eos> <bos> DATA: It reads similar to early Starfleet efforts but uses theHeglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different. Which is actually not important at this time. <eos> <bos> DATA: The facts to date would lead to an objective conclusion that heis not. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computers were also affected, which would indicate the phenomenonwas not an illusion butoccurred in real time. <eos> <bos> DATA: The music is on all communications channels, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I need temporary lodging. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have found a quicker way out of here, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibility, a kind of human behaviour I was not designed toemulate. <eos> <bos> DATA: By feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlierexperiences with the probe. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know the Trieste. Too small, too slow. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Klingon vessel has recloaked, sir. I haveno readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do not have a staff. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: If they do not have a plan for this contingency, we may have theinitiative. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Ferengi have broken off their attack. Drop shields. Transportthe away team aboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have finished. <eos> <bos> DATA: A perfect score? <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise to object off our starboard bow. Request that youidentify yourself. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have told me no one from the village has ever been to theVellorian Mountains. How can you be certain there are ferociouscreatures there? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your hypothesis is certainly plausible. There may be another shipon the other side of the fissure, where we cannot detect it. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will find Doctor Pulaski in here. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be a case of judging us by our own rules, sir. If weviolate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us to be deceitfuland untrustworthy. You do recall they cautioned us not to interferewith their children below. What has happened? <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Excuse me. Aside from the main door, is there anotherexit I might use? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanners are showing a window, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: When he was attacked, Professor Galen began to protect certainfiles in his computer memory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlikely, sir. Your collection has been confiscated. All of yourstolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners. Youhave lost everything you value. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is now within twenty thousand kilometres of theEnterprise and closing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand it involves deep meditation in the lava caves ofNo'Mat. That prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatoryeffect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Many of its components have been removed. Apparently LieutenantRiker used them to keep the station's radiation shield operational. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are experiencing a quantum-model oscillation delay, doublingin intensity every twelve point three seconds. Bio-cellular disruptionis imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path. Source unknown. <eos> <bos> DATA: The dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirelyunpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described interms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But thatdescription does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that farexceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am studying skin samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt toisolate the cause of the illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am notcertain what would be an effective lure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why have I been brought here? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Tamarians have transported Captain Picard to the planetsurface along with their own captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I've been most anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion,Mister Argyle. Do you believe he can be made to function? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, but the risk of structural collapse is quite high. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only twenty-one percent of the time does he rely upon traditionaltactics. So, the Captain must be preparedfor unusual cunning. Counsellor, Commander Riker will assume we havemade this analysis, and knowing that we know his methods, he will alterthem. But, knowing that we know that he knows that we know, he mightchoose to return to his usual pattern. <eos> <bos> DATA: Help. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you believe that we are in some ways alike, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: The hologram generator is now functioning, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, have you ever had a nightmare? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have discovered, sir, a certain level of impatience when Icalculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second. However, ifyou wish <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, very good, Lal. You have correctly processed the sense oftouch. There are many fascinating experiences I wish to share with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Pakled ship has a shield up, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos> <bos> DATA: If Lieutenant Worf resists, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I would estimate four billion, three hundred seventy five millionPICARD <eos> <bos> DATA: I am tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. Theship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometresfrom here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and ishailing us. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be beyond their technology. Similar to Romulanshields. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty sevenmillion strands of energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I have studied the philosophies of virtually everyknown acting master. I find myself attracted to Stanislavsky, Adler,Garnav. Proponents of an acting technique known as the Method. <eos> <bos> DATA: How does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoymentof sex? <eos> <bos> DATA: We could remove the implant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Jenna, you are repeating yourself. I have often found this to beindicative of mental distraction. Is that a correct assumption in thisinstance? <eos> <bos> DATA: An excellent idea, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will try, but the Intrepid was at the edge of sensor rangeduring the attack and we cannot be sure if the scan was complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will have your answered questions as soon as possible,Professor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot do that, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly, Wesley. I realised for the first time it was possible tocontinue Doctor Soong's work. My initial transfers produced veryencouraging results, so I brought Lal's brain back with me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Evidently. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps that is a part of our difficulty. Words are all we havebeen using. Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions. Irequire a phaser. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, are you seeing the image of your mother? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Romulan ship is hailing thealien using their equivalent of linguacode. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta,you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken,Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's. <eos> <bos> DATA: We would completely burn off the planet's atmosphere. Captain's log, supplemental. While Doctor Moseleytakes La Forge's plan to the leaders of the colony, I find myselfweighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue. <eos> <bos> DATA: Wesley, now! <eos> <bos> DATA: The warship is capable of striking us with far more powerfulbursts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I to infer that you intend to keep me captive? <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Graves at my command have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'emforth by my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and whenI have required some heavenly music, which even now I do, to work mineend upon their senses, that this airy charm is for, I'll break mystaff, bury it certain fathoms in the earth, and deeper than did everplummet sound, I'll Captain? Sir, your attention iswandering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Feline supplement number two twenty one. <eos> <bos> DATA: What do you wish to talk about? <eos> <bos> DATA: I can see we have a lot of work to do. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shipyard where the Enterprise was built. <eos> <bos> DATA: Although Alpha Onias three is a class Mplanet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Just as I expected. I am fine. Could not be better. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I expressed no such interest. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have not been able to isolate the problem, sir. I might make amistake. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe that will be necessary, Captain. He is no longerin the drive section. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe your plan is a bit premature. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I am their friend. Should I not stand with them in a time ofdifficulty? <eos> <bos> DATA: I think you should be destroyed. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is impossible to tell from a visual inspection. However, itappears to be focused on the warbird's Engineering section. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, warp pulse calculations arecomplete. We will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for sixpoint three seconds before disengaging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Premise. The Ferengi wish tocapture the Hathaway believing itto be value. Therefore wemust remove the ship fromtheir field of interest. KOLRAMI <eos> <bos> DATA: I see. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, assume these symbols are pulsars. Translate associatedvalues into standard temporal notations. Computer, is there a pulsarwith a rotational period of one point five two four four seconds withinsensor range? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then he is questioning my ability as a parent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ow. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It appears we will be able to transport to the surfacesooner than anticipated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Clearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system. <eos> <bos> DATA: I appreciate your seeking other options, sir. Your decision couldhave been unilateral. <eos> <bos> DATA: Transistor material. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: They came looking for me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you believe it to be the right decision for them to marry? <eos> <bos> DATA: Boosting it? How? We will discuss thislater. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, if I am correct, the exocomps will not allowthemselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival, and theywill shut down before they will comply with the order. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that important? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, when I first awoke from my nightmare, there was a briefmoment when I <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. One which I have just created for romantic relationships. <eos> <bos> DATA: First neural connection is confirmed. I cannot report anysignificant access to the Borg consciousness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then why not rely strictly on the facts? <eos> <bos> DATA: No. It is just that for a moment, the expression on your facereminded me of her. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask you a question, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Only with long term exposure, sir. There is no immediate threat. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eighty two percent dilithium hydroxyls. Magnesium,chromium. It should provide an effective screen against their sensors,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting thetable. It appears that within the disturbance, time is moving at anaccelerated rate, approximately fifty times faster than normal. Thedisturbance is spherical in shape. It is extending outward from thehull approximately seventeen metres from the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: No anomalous readings were reported. <eos> <bos> DATA: That story is generally considered to be apocryphal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Some type of tractor beam has locked onto us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Time, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Confirm, sir. Navigation is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I have speculated, the presence of refractory metals <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Obviously a class M world. Gravity and oxygen within our limits. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my next leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is highly unlikely. Rana Four possessed no interstellarspacecraft. <eos> <bos> DATA: Vulnerable, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If your intention is to make me human, Q. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: She knows me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Android. Artificial life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, you are injured. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Are they not here on Starbase? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? I have a personal favour to ask. I considered CommanderLa Forge to be my best friend. I believe it is my responsibility toplan and conduct the memorial service. May I have your permission to doso? <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be more accurate to say it is good for me, as itlubricates my bio-functions. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that with each new generation they enhancetheir own design. The rate of evolution would be extraordinary. <eos> <bos> DATA: How do you do. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: The images I saw during the time I was shutdown were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in myneural net. I believe Doctor Soong incorporated those circuits into mybase programming, intending to activate them when I reached a certainlevel of development. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion? <eos> <bos> DATA: A positive displacement of point zero zero four percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your was also found on the message control module. <eos> <bos> DATA: Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Devoras is dropping out of warp, sir. Their weapon systemsare powering up. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe is descending out of range. <eos> <bos> DATA: The fragment's course has been altered by one point two onedegrees, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I beg your pardon? <eos> <bos> DATA: We should begin decontamination immediately. Run an internalsensor sweep for locations of all chroniton fields on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: My understanding of the human brain suggests that the process isthe same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. If youwant to retrieve it, you simply access the proper sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. Of course it is. <eos> <bos> DATA: This one is empty. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe that is the case, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be a considerable risk, sir, but it would also representa gesture of trust on our part. It could be an important step towardpeace, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Intersection eight J, aft port. Establish. <eos> <bos> DATA: But it was done. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scan shows no debris within that radius. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Report, please. Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Captain. Energy only. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Geordi. I shall miss you at weapons systems analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the alien vessel is coming within weapons range. Its shields are up. <eos> <bos> DATA: it was then that I began to suspect that your brother did not dieby his own hand. That he was, in fact, murdered. <eos> <bos> DATA: The advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you must decide which is your greater obligation. Yourloyalty to Sarek or your duty to the Federation. Can you accept thelogic of continuing this mission? <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. I understand all too well. Removing the competitionwill not help you, Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Wesley, congratulations on passing your Starfleet writtenexamination. An excellent achievement. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am ready, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, initiate cascade sequence, accepting instructions fromCommander Data en route. Now. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have analysed Commander Riker's structure. A syntheticT-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activatehis latent introns. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nine minutes, forty seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I should escort the Doctor, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unable to make a precise measurement. However I wouldestimate impact within ninety seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, permission to beam down to Drema Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic, artificially reproducinga floral scent. <eos> <bos> DATA: These quarters were obviously intended forone crewmember, sir. There is but a single sleeping space. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, are you injured? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. That is what I am trying to do, sir, but the solutioneludes me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been exploring the possibility ofusing a tractor beam to pull the Raman from the atmosphere. However,the high level of interference prevents a positive lock. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture toactivate. I suggest we avoid exposing it to any <eos> <bos> DATA: A highly respected scientist, considered a visionary, he advancedseveral time-related theories. One regarding the relationships betweentime and gravity was quite intriguing. But neither that theory nor anyotherreceived wide acceptance. <eos> <bos> DATA: The tachyon signatures will not last long. By the time the fleetis deployed, it will be too late. Begin to reconfigure the sensors todetect ionised particle traces. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. It is much less Spartan, is it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: He's telling the truth. Their heading haschanged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Really? Did you know that there are currently five Tyrelliansserving aboard the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is where Mogh's alleged transmission should be. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not, sir. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntaryconfinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you haveviolated Federation law <eos> <bos> DATA: Auxiliary generators losing power, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communicationchannel. <eos> <bos> DATA: They have little regard for human life. Thus, the most sensiblecourse is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of yourpeople. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was, and the exocomp must have realised that. It saw thatthere was no real danger and completed the repairs. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: More particularly, that our opposition does indeed consist of twomen, and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged DoctorPulaski. <eos> <bos> DATA: We now know what is causing the bursts, and why the sciencestation exploded, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? Youare dismantling a warp plasma conduit. I must ask you to stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sine I am not affected by emotionalconsiderations, I am closer to being Vulcan than human. However, whiletheir devotion to logic does have a certain appeal, I find their starkphilosophy to be somewhat limited. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos> <bos> DATA: The polarising effect being created by the beam may make itpossible for us to be detected. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Federation will offer as little or as much help as youdictate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why is Spot under the bed? <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Wes. <eos> <bos> DATA: The act or the emotion? <eos> <bos> DATA: But I do, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My calculations indicate that its target is the house of Kevinand Rishon Uxbridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields have registered an impact, however sensors show nothingin the vicinity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. For a reason I cannot explain, I had the need todestroy it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference. Readings are still inconclusive, however the moon's atmosphere iscapable of supporting life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course not. <eos> <bos> DATA: In my study of interpersonal dynamics, I have found that conflictfollowed by emotional release often strengthens the connection betweentwo people. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have coated this piece of cloth with theliquid which is used in lamps. As you can see, the cloth becomesluminescent when it is exposed to an energy source. This pendant alsoappears to be an energy source. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, not from our present orbit. The array is currentlydirected away from us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of humanunderstanding often created social obstacles. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, other than ourselves, I am picking up no life signs here. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, we are too far below the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are ready to bring the interface online,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: But our mission <eos> <bos> DATA: Not with her hands, no. But with this. When usedas a garrote, these beads will leave marks quite similar tofingerprints. And, my dear Watson, you will note from the victim'sthroat, the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by humanhands. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I suggest a different approach? You were attempting toconstruct the upper level before the supports were in place. Observe. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is conceivable, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibility, a malfunction in their engines, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when weencountered it, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is time for the wedding rehearsal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, assume those paths are course corrections and derivegravitational values for stellar objects near those flight paths. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no defence, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then what do you believe I am? <eos> <bos> DATA: I got angry. Captain's log, stardate 46982.1. Because of hisunusual behaviour on the planet surface, Commander Data has asked to betemporarily relieved of duty. Unfortunately, this means he will not beable to help us investigate a disturbing new change in the behaviour ofthe Borg. <eos> <bos> DATA: This class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam onit. Seize it, limit it's field of fire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Emergency medical team to Doctor Crusher'soffice immediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Ramsey is correct, Counsellor. The Odin was not astarship, which means her crew is not bound by the Prime Directive. Ifhe and the others wish to stay here, there is absolutely nothing we cando about it. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavaladuring the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. Theywere both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Thetato Mavala and returned four days later. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not entirely certain they will, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: He says to the shopkeeper, I'd like a pound of kiddillies,please. The shopkeeper says to him, You meankidneys, don't you? The man says, I said kiddillies, diddle I? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. His would seem to confirm that observation. Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving. <eos> <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will go immediately, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Definitely human. Male. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I would. <eos> <bos> DATA: He served in many campaigns during the Tarsian War, received twopromotions, to the rank of Subhadar. A very honourable tour of duty <eos> <bos> DATA: Locked on. We can beam Nuria aboard at will. <eos> <bos> DATA: Firing phasers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Federation vessels have encountered Tamarian ships seven timesover the past one hundred years. Each meeting went without incident,however formal relations were not established because communication wasnot possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: The away team signal's been cut off, Captain. We've lost contactwith our people. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. I will. <eos> <bos> DATA: The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of hissoldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Maquis ships are regrouping, sir. They are closing in on theCardassian vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Minister. He has not returned to our designated transportcoordinates. We have continued to scan the capital city withoutsuccess. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a valid projection. It is apparent that my reach hasexceeded my grasp in this particular area. I am perhapsnot nearly so human as I aspire to become. If you are ready to eat, Iwill bring our meal. <eos> <bos> DATA: That will not be necessary. Computer, end programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: A resumption of our present course at warp six will place us inthe T'lli Beta system in six days, thirteen hours, forty seven minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: We can programme the ship's computer to supply simulations on theHolodeck. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will be in position over the drilling sitein three minutes twenty nine seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Port thrusters firing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the life form is draining energy directly from the fusionreactors. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe that is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. I hope the Captain remembers hisphysical pattern is here. If he has, his energy has moved into thetransporter relays by now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Considerable fire damage to interior surface reported, sir. Butnone of her main systems were crippled. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I've been reviewing the unmannedprobe scans. At some point during the last one hundred and fifty years,the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroidbelt. <eos> <bos> DATA: I've got some information on its first transmission, sir. Ittranslates as stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspacecommunications. <eos> <bos> DATA: On the viewer, Captain. Unidentified vesseltravelling sub-warp speed, bearing two three five point seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct. Based on the antiproton decay, I would estimate theincident occurred within the last four point three hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a misconception that all Rategs speak with a particularinflection. In fact, there are twelve different <eos> <bos> DATA: No, I am not capable of hatred. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at three <eos> <bos> DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: At present, I cannot. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have overridden Danar's bypass. Shuttlebay two is once againinactive. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a starship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Three minutes, eleven seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: For the past six hours, I have attempted toproduce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have less than three minutes left. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: It will not take long to isolate the appropriate geneticmaterial. I will need to get the Sickbay computer back on <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know how much longer my vision would have continued hadI not been reactivated. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel has altered its course to a direct intercept with theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be a most noble cause, Q. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Is something wrong, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: My reading is intensifying, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The mesosphere is gone. Plasmonic reactions are now beginning tobreak down the troposphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at all. <eos> <bos> DATA: You asked to see me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Difficult to explain, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shearing force is at one hundred three metric tons. Tractor beamis stable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, the curewas found in a plant indigenous to only Brekka, and which resisted allattempts at cultivation on Ornara. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, resume normal illumination. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no significant difference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Entity is beginning to resonate. Vibrations areincreasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you undamaged? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know, but you leave me no other choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: If Doctor Manheim's information is correct, by my calculations,the next time distortion should occur between twenty eight to fortyseven minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical to the onefound in the cavern. <eos> <bos> DATA: Completely, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, our communications are being monitored. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do not seem happy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whetherDoctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents werelost when the government was overthrown. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid the prisoner has eluded us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this shouldn't be. Our ship's power systems are failing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have observed that humans often base their judgments on what isreferred to as instinct or intuition. Because I am a machine, I lackthat particular ability. However it may be possible that I have insightinto other machines that humans lack. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fear is a quality that I do not possess. <eos> <bos> DATA: The doors, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why are you suddenly being so helpful? <eos> <bos> DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has beenaltered by the Borg. <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion no longer registers on our instruments. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There were no errors, Geordi. The variance must be no more thanpoint zero six terawatts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity,which the Romulans use in their engine, for a natural one. A blackhole. They tried to use it as a nest. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We programmed the main computer to transmit the same opticalburst to all display screens, work stations and terminals throughoutthe ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask a question, sir, of a personal nature? <eos> <bos> DATA: In several cases, an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slowthe progress of metal parasites. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. Am I intruding? <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, the sale price of this edifice is twelve point fivemillion. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. That would be wrong. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was my experience as well. I simply felt angry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe that is also an attainable goal. If we utilise theentire Engineering department, there should be sufficient manpoweravailable to complete the task. <eos> <bos> DATA: How is your diplomatic assignment progressing? <eos> <bos> DATA: We are here for the day, from the city of Rateg. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, link with the shuttle's onboard system. Access theisolinear storage assembly. Scan all chips which contain mission logs. Note any discrepancies. <eos> <bos> DATA: We may be more successful in deciphering the code they use totransport through the magnetic shield. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is definitely debris. The primary material is duranium, withsmaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, not yet. <eos> <bos> DATA: The electromagnetic window on the planet is closing, sir. Threeminutes remain. <eos> <bos> DATA: To affect all iterative branch points inthe <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos> <bos> DATA: The weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely twelveminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Read, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: The train has returned to normal, sir. Our destination is NewVertiform City. <eos> <bos> DATA: Begin shuttlecraft launch sequence. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sensors cannot identify the point of origin. It seems to becoming from all around us. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Lal. I am here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Add to it an attack by a nonexistent Romulan vessel. It doessuggest an interesting question. Was our away team actually over there? <eos> <bos> DATA: Use it also to describe for the Captain the time you spent amongthe colonists. Including everything you know about what happened tothem. <eos> <bos> DATA: The modifications that you have made to the torpedo's guidancesystems are remarkable, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a starship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: In effect, you have abandoned what I have sought all my life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Alors, nous sommes presque frères. Je suis heureux de vousconnaitre. <eos> <bos> DATA: Due to this forcefield, there is presently no way to beam usback, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have traced the failure to a data netinterface which routes replicator selections to the correctsubprocessors. <eos> <bos> DATA: That may provide an explanation for the tactics he was able touse against us when we tried to capture him. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain that is true. I believe I have an idea. <eos> <bos> DATA: All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an inventor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Confirmed. The phenomenon does not have a definable centre orouter edge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our destination is the Beta Stromgren system,following the path of the Vega Nine probe. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lock on comm. link and boost. <eos> <bos> DATA: Plasma inductors are not responding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you compared the genetic code with the Ambassador's lastrecorded transporter ID traces? <eos> <bos> DATA: I suspected you would attempt to operate the interface alone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spinning wheels? Accessing. A device for spinningyarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel andone spindle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields have been automatically activated. Tractor beamdisengaged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enduring physical suffering is considered a Klingon spiritualtest. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am ready to depolarise the power grid. <eos> <bos> DATA: That may not be possible, sir. The starboard nacelle sustained adirect hit. Warp engines are offline. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you will find, Inspector, that this emissary here worksnot for but against the King of Bohemia, and that photograph of theking and his mistress is to be used as blackmail. Further, upon deeperreflection, you will deduce, as did I, that <eos> <bos> DATA: Not yet, sir. But with your help, I am learning. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I was on Iconia, now I am on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please. <eos> <bos> DATA: The wave has been disrupted, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm afraid I have no time to answer a million questions. I have amission to accomplish. I need to know more about your people, andGosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems. Hull breaches on decks seventeen and thirty six. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pleasant dreams, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are already at seventy five percent of tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: You're welcome, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: To begin the first illumination test. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to my memory log, I did not use those words. Ya'll mustbe mistaken. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would entail the use of Klingon painstiks. <eos> <bos> DATA: Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlikely. A problem with the replicator would have affected thecontents as well as the glass. But the liquid in the glass was asynthehol replication of a light ale of Earth origin, which is, Ibelieve what Lieutenant Duffy ordered. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, may I see you? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin is unique. Inthat case, I am alone. We have accessed the information storage area. Considerable damage has been done to the files themselves. <eos> <bos> DATA: A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractorbeam. It might have deflected the transporter beam to a different setof coordinates. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I get you a drink, dear? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have some information regarding Amanda Rogers' parents. Recordsindicate that they died in Topeka, Kansas. Their home was destroyed during a tornado. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have reviewed the vessel's mission plans. The Raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere, eleven thousandkilometres below its current position. The crew was to sample theatmosphere at that level, and then return to a safer orbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Machine, Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. Computer, access the exocomp's sensor logs. Confirm thatthere was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelvehours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magneticcoils the freighters depend on. Assuming the malfunction is similar,suitable replacements can be fabricated. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will die too, Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: A Klingon male. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no way to precisely calculate that, Commander, but it islikely. <eos> <bos> DATA: Their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontationdesigned to test Federation defenses along the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, if I give my life to save my fellow officers, that ismy choice. The exocomps no longer have a choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ishara is willing to have the implantremoved, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Poker? <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. You are capable of great sadism andcruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will call. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the holodeck appears to be inoperation. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is It is It isgreen. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are very strange looking creatures. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. The diagnostic of the transporter system shows ananomalous energy fluctuation. I will need to inspect the imagingscanner in transporter room three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, and it still may, in a limited fashion not detectable by ourlong range sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. Fold. To bend. To make compact or to capitulate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, there is still one fact we have not considered. Theabnormal energy reading in the Captain's quarters was never explained. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a cosmic string fragment. Only one hundred sevenkilometres long. <eos> <bos> DATA: Running frequency search. Negative, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dytallix B is one of seven uninhabited planets mined for theFederation by the Dytallix Mining Company. It is in the nearby Mirasystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do. Thank you for making it clear to me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are his sentiments typical of the colonists? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the containment field is beginningto fluctuate. Failure anticipated in <eos> <bos> DATA: Would you care to deal, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: The children were not laughing with you, they were laughing atyou. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so. I have proven to be vulnerable. At the presenttime, my deductions should be treated with scepticism. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is also no way of knowing if the Professor's ability toexist off the holodeck is permanent. It may be unwise to considercreating a second individual while this uncertainty exists. <eos> <bos> DATA: The container does show evidence of residual ionisation. Ibelieve your hypothesis was correct. It was used to store high energyplasma. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, three metre cross seal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, someone is approaching. A humanoid. Forty metres dueeast and closing. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a complex question, Lal. I can only begin to answer bytelling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to theworld in which we live. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! <eos> <bos> DATA: We are now within the distortion wave. Hull stresses haveexceeded maximum tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: They could mean anything. Unless we can narrow the parameters ofthe search, it would be almost impossible for the computer to identifythe pattern with any accuracy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. I suggest we look around to see if anybody ishome. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have noticed, Doctor <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres. However, Iam reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilised. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Quite amusing, Doctor Hawking. You see, Sir Isaac, the jokedepends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature ofspace-time. If two non-inertial reference frames are in relative motionNEWTON <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There has been an accident on the holodeck, sir. Hasanything happened to the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could berelated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energy output is negligible, sir. Radiation patterns no longercoherent. I believe it is dead, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ejection systems offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behavetoward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when Iappear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that anaccurate observation? <eos> <bos> DATA: Working under the assumption that Kolrami was attempting to win,it is reasonable to assume that he expected me to play for the samegoal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Explain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I hope you enjoy it. <eos> <bos> DATA: All is quiet so far. Of course, no oneknew we were coming. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Priming the energy-transfer matrix. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? <eos> <bos> DATA: I consider Geordi to be my best friend. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello, Kareen. Don't you think it's time westopped pretending? You know who I am. <eos> <bos> DATA: Startling. Quite extraordinary, in fact. <eos> <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ow. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: We are now entering the Turkana system, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cloaked Romulan ships could produce that effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a fascinating hypothesis. How did you formulate <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot. I will not. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The most direct route is blocked, but I believe we canuse a starboard service crawlway. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. <eos> <bos> DATA: The delay will also make it possible for Stellar Dynamics tocomplete their study of the Vodrey Nebula. <eos> <bos> DATA: And yours as well, Commander. She is listed as representing theBetazed government at the conference. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can repair the damaged plasma vent fromhere. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a large chamber twenty metres ahead. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have an idea. If we take the shipto the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell <eos> <bos> DATA: Will you take care of Spot for me? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am painting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Life support system, engineering and propulsion all appearfunctional. But there are no life signs, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: When the effect hits, the forcefields will align, opening a cleanstraight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, Imust add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if theProfessor was right, I will need a twenty seven second countdown. <eos> <bos> DATA: Rigelian phaser rifles, sir. Not particularly powerful. <eos> <bos> DATA: The starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable. <eos> <bos> DATA: All decks reporting minor injuries only. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, you did not. I do not believe the Commander is acting ofhis own accord. He has been receiving E-band signals through his visor. Signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain. I havesurmised that Commander La Forge was conditioned by Romulans, a processreferred to historically, and somewhat inaccurately, as brainwashing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was hoping that you might have another option, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The wave is about to overtake us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I feel it is important to determine the reason for <eos> <bos> DATA: Cold feet? Jitters. A nervous reaction to an impending event ofgreat importance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency andamplitude, it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Expanding analysis parameters. Including Bayesian functions,broad EM and subspace spectrum polling. <eos> <bos> DATA: As normal as ever, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Professor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Purpose? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, eliminate programme one. Computer, eliminate programmetwo. Computer, eliminateprogramme three. Computer, half volume. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, we do. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we're losing life support on decks eleven and twelve. <eos> <bos> DATA: I made a leap of faith. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise to Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will beless enjoyable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, I had read and absorbed every treatise and textbook on thesubject, and felt myself well prepared for the experience. Yet, when Ifinally played poker, I discovered that the reality bore littleresemblance to the rules. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. I have experimented with producing vibrations incrystals by means of graviton pulses. <eos> <bos> DATA: I found it extremely interesting. The lateral sensor arrays ranthree separate spectral analyses of the Alawanir Nebula on threedistinct frequencies. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I am not capable of love. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be connected to several other systems as well,including the warp control circuits. <eos> <bos> DATA: The input levels are currently at fifty three percent oftolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Watson, the doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall. The other is shorter, left handed, and is employed in a laboratory. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not doubt you, Doctor, but I have tried one hundred seventythree phonetic variations of the name, and I <eos> <bos> DATA: Gold. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained from theshuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order toactivate the shuttle's systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sexual attraction in this context is not a part of myprogramming. I am an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Wright has effectively fused the incongruities of thesurrealists with the irrationality of Dadaism. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do bear a resemblance to Doctor Noonian Soong, thecyberneticist who constructed me. But, Doctor Soong was killed shortlyafterward by the Crystalline Entity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will the Enterprise need to follow thetest vehicle? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show several objects in our path, sir. They are twentynine metres in length and are unmanned. <eos> <bos> DATA: The T'Ong has changed course to three twomark eight one. Increasing to warp three. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no reports of any Federation ships in that area, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspacefield distortions. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Counsellor was unsuccessful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yeah, me too, boss. I'd love to take a gander. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy intoradiation. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry for that, but it is very complicated. Does your familyknow where you are? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have been considering the problem of the missing ship. Although there is no record of a launch to the Ficus sector, whichwould not be unusual considering the chaos of the early twenty secondcentury, someone had to load that ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Human nature, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: You are free to stay here as long as you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledge the signal. Ensign, lay in the course and engage atwarp nine point three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only time, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir, into the standard parking orbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. LAFORGE <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Brechtian Cluster has two inhabited planets. <eos> <bos> DATA: To give their lives meaning. A sense of purpose. <eos> <bos> DATA: Try a bypass on the shield control interface. <eos> <bos> DATA: If so, we may have to call Security. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of the tactical situation, Lieutenant. Let them go. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, if I do not succeed, how violent is the Sheliak reactionlikely to be? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not offended. You are upset. Your reactions are notsurprising. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twenty six minutes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is something wrong, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: He's in the ship's circuitry. Come to the Transporter room,please. There might be a way, sir. Hurry! <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you recommend a way to counter the effect? Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. That they were too engaged in their own affairs to havedisabled our ship and murdered the Engineer. Given a choice, they'drather kill each other than any of us. It's elementary, my dear Riker. Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: However it will take some time to takeeffect. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am merely stating a fact, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have voiced certain reservations to me about his abilities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate theanomaly. If we had information on the centre of the phenomenon, wemight have a basis for speculation. <eos> <bos> DATA: In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques,a broad variety of pleasuring, <eos> <bos> DATA: I could not leave them there, Captain. The condition of theirvehicle was deteriorating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Except that Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leaderbecomes an honoured guest. Not us, not second in command, him. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed, sir. I'm on my way. Data out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spot. Spot. Spot, down. Spot, down. Down. Spot. Down. This is down. Down is good. This is up. Up is no. <eos> <bos> DATA: Show me the shortest route to Transporter room one. Computer,prepare to activate cascade force field sequence in the followingprogression. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Frequency open and secured. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is designed so that each approach they take will spawn ananomalous solution. The anomalies are designed to interact with eachother, linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then there was the concert in Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> DATA: A human female. <eos> <bos> DATA: This planet may have been the most distant outpost, sir, but itshows no life form readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why do you say that? <eos> <bos> DATA: The resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite orepresent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not necessarily meaningless, Commander. The Klingons regardhonour above all else. If the crew of the Enterprise-C had diedfighting for the survival of a Klingon outpost, it would be considereda meaningful act of honour by the Klingon Empire. <eos> <bos> DATA: I disagree, Commander. After studying the design of thisstructure, I have determined that our best route of escape would be theunderground exit to the east of this wing. I have disconnected certainsecurity scanners to assist us. I am afraid we cannot permit you towarn your guards. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we have re-established exactcoordinates and attitude. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, permission to observe the interrogation? <eos> <bos> DATA: That poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter. For my ninthpoem, <eos> <bos> DATA: The weaker his position, the more aggressive will be his posture. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, thank you. Excuse me, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would certainly be sufficient, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: At warp six, fifty three hours, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your gut? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, continue monitoring the precise position of the echo. Any sudden change in its behaviour, initiate Yellow Alert. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will need to run a full biospectral analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we go back to the Devron system now, we might be able to seethe initial formation of the anomaly. <eos> <bos> DATA: The waves are even more intense within the rift. I estimate hershields will fail in approximately twelve hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where is Doctor Pulaski? <eos> <bos> DATA: The plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to injector lock. An emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eight. Ace. Queen. The dealer receives a four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is to be done with them, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: More than interested. Fascinated. One might say agog. But I alsofind sneezing interesting. <eos> <bos> DATA: The soliton wave has closed to tenkilometres, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed, Captain? I know many more interesting anecdotes, sir. Forexample, <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would be happier in another job. <eos> <bos> DATA: My friend Chief O'Brien often says thatabove all else, he wants to make Keiko happy. Since cancelling thewedding will make her happy, I must conclude the Chief will be pleasedat her decision. <eos> <bos> DATA: Expression of what? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will not submit to the procedure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are half human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Caught in the after effect. I amattempting <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not sing for me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I doubt that statement is entirely accurate either, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least two days, sir. The Corridor is over twelve light yearslong, and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensorrange. <eos> <bos> DATA: What are we to look for, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: But Commander, the Dremans are not a subject for philosophicaldebate. They are a people. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave theholodeck. He never did. Neither did we. None of this is real. It is asimulation. We are still on the holodeck. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am simply trying to make an objective assessment. <eos> <bos> DATA: How sad, dear brother. You make me wish I were an only child. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am certain the Admiral is anxious to meetLal. I have been sending him regular status reports on her development. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ensign, scan for Starfleet combadge signals. Is Commander Rikeraboard that ship? <eos> <bos> DATA: Solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable. At lastknown course and speed, the Borg vessel should enter the system inthree minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will findacceptable. Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again. <eos> <bos> DATA: This side of the wormhole is not stable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared betweenfriends. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must leave immediately, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The correct procedure would be to adjust the converter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Elevated CO2 levels at twenty kilometres, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: This way sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifty three seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There do not seem to be enough waiters on duty. 3 <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, we have come this far. <eos> <bos> DATA: Q'Maire at station, holding steady at bearing zero one three,mark zero one five. Distance five oh six kilometres. <eos> <bos> DATA: Containment fields to flight tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will have to draw power from the life-support systems in orderto discharge the collectors. This is Acting Captain Data. All personnelwill report to designated shelter areasDATA <eos> <bos> DATA: Clearly, they unwilling to be transported into the stream fordetonation, although they may have an alternate solution. <eos> <bos> DATA: Firing shuttle thrusters. <eos> <bos> DATA: This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton fieldemanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in thesubspace continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, Commander. Sensors show she's in the midst of agroup of Mintakans. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. We have approximately fifty two metresremaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a maincorridor. <eos> <bos> DATA: This contradicts everything we know about holodeck physics. <eos> <bos> DATA: Prime Minister, if you have the skills to create a mastersoldier, can you not contradict the effect? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would care for something to drink? <eos> <bos> DATA: The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core. <eos> <bos> DATA: Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: By robbing her of her memories? <eos> <bos> DATA: Why did you create me? <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship has moved into warp, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: An irony. It means that you have achieved in disgrace what I havealways aspired to be. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: When I realised the crew was incapacitated, I initiated emergencyproceduresDATA <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not directly, no. But you did question me about the diplomaticcapabilities of both Captain Picard and Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will also need to communicate with the Enterprise in sectortwo thirteen. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not beable to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is the chip my father created for me so that I couldexperience emotions. I had it removed from Lore's body before he wasdismantled. <eos> <bos> DATA: Second-hand, sir? Oh, of course. A human joke. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most interesting. Could this be human joke number six hundredsixty three? <eos> <bos> DATA: I could be chasing an untamed ornithoid without a cause. <eos> <bos> DATA: At present course and speed, ten hours fifty three minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer perform a level one diagnostic ofthe exocomp's command module. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle. <eos> <bos> DATA: The neutrino stream is coming in strongly. Sensors are trackingthe probe despite the interference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please identify yourselves. I must know what you are trying to <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not privy to the exact details of when, where or how yourfirst coupling took place. I could investigate it <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemywith a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. Itwas considered extremely heroic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello, Spot. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

The Lantree was not the source ofthe disease, but it was the trigger. <eos> <bos> DATA: I regret the decision, but I must. I am the culmination of oneman's dream. This is not ego or vanity, but when Doctor Soong createdme he added to the substance of the universe. If by your experiments Iam destroyed, something unique, something wonderful will be lost. Icannot permit that, I must protect his dream. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. As an energy pattern, free of the limitations ofmatter, he might travel anywhere, at any velocity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, something is emerging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I was not informed of any change in the duty roster. <eos> <bos> DATA: The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I aminitiating Red Alert. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was hoping you would be able to determine that from hertransporter trace pattern. <eos> <bos> DATA: I hope you find the performance pleasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him socompletely human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where is Commander Riker? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am picking them up, sir, but I cannot identify the source. Theyseem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometreapogee. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore is no longer functioning, sir. He must be disassembled sothat he is no longer a threat. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating static warp shell now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initially, Commander Maddox, I found it difficult tomaintain friendships, since human emotions are often puzzling to me. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is really you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would need to study Manheim's records. <eos> <bos> DATA: The technology required to achieve this biological and artificialinterface is far beyond our capabilities. There are many advantages. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I've traced it through our sensor channel,sir It is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: The first months following my activation were a difficult periodfor me. There were many problems associated with my becoming sentient. <eos> <bos> DATA: The train we encountered was from one of Doctor Crusher'sholodeck programs. It was a re-creation of the Orient Express, a trainwhich travelled from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth centuryuntil. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no memory of events during that period. When we arefinished here, I will perform a self-diagnostic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am French, sir, not Swiss. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have simulated several such fields, but were unable toreproduce the same drag coefficient. <eos> <bos> DATA: As in a human brainwave pattern? <eos> <bos> DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bartender! <eos> <bos> DATA: Judging a being by its physical appearance is the last majorhuman prejudice, Wesley. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most of our sensors would be ineffective, although ourdirectional array should cut through the interference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish to leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you injured her? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensor readings indicate the presence of aG-type star at the centre of the sphere. There also appears to be aclass-M atmosphere clinging to the interior surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. A systematicsurvey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr? Doctor Marr, we must return to theintermittent signal. <eos> <bos> DATA: You and I are real, sir, as is Lieutenant Barclay. We entered theholodeck together when we first went to see Moriarty. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which ismanaged by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the shipmany of the characteristics of a biological organism. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will. Thank you, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: That cannot be. The image I saw was of Doctor Soong as a youngman. I did not encounter him until much later in his life. Thereappears to be no rational explanation for my experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communicationwith the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. <eos> <bos> DATA: And since we do not know it's intent, I recommend we go to RedAlert. <eos> <bos> DATA: It seems your quarters have reverted to their earlier state ofdisorder. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. It appears to be a scanner. Possibly a transmitter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Silence, Klingon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, dim lights. <eos> <bos> DATA: The workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are tryingto demolish the ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, Freud'scautions at the other end, were warnings of the dangers around us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are tracking the entity. It is approaching CaptainPicard's position. <eos> <bos> DATA: The anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet,sir. It is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundariesby an outer covering of silicates, actinides, and carbonaceouschondrites. <eos> <bos> DATA: Outside temperature is rising rapidly. One point seven millionKelvins. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, but we have traced residual energy readings to a caverntwo kilometres beneath the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship. However,there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquaticlab. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are being boarded. <eos> <bos> DATA: Their leader refuses my counsel. <eos> <bos> DATA: An accident in Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eight. Ace. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. For Commander Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesisis in error. <eos> <bos> DATA: Broaden search pattern beyond communications. Does the waveformdisplayed conform to any natural phenomena, cryptographic formats orlifeform EM emissions? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am now attempting to access the long rangesensor array. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have many human friends. I would be pleased to count you amongthem. <eos> <bos> DATA: When you get to be my age, you will understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by. Processing. Processing. Fascinating. The Borg groupconsciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out allfunctions. Defence, communication, navigation. They are all controlledby a root command implanted into each <eos> <bos> DATA: Their phasers, sir, set on kill. <eos> <bos> DATA: The analysis of the fragments is not yet complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ensign, whom do you suggest we speak to? RO <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship's energy is being drained into the fissure before we canutilise it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, the interface circuitry which links the exocomp to thecontrol pad is completely burned out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most interesting. Do you? <eos> <bos> DATA: CO2 concentrations remain unchanged atupper elevations. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My most recent self-diagnostic revealed no malfunctions. Perhapsthere is something wrong with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: To what are you referring? <eos> <bos> DATA: A tetryon field would be formed briefly in the cabin, temporarilydisrupting the metaphasic shield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, begin scan phase. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand your dilemma. I once had what could be considered acrisis of the spirit. <eos> <bos> DATA: As requested, Captain, library computer information on thisplanet. It has been charted only from long range scans. It is Class M,but shows no indications of life forms, sentient or otherwise. However,you may find this of interest. Resolving it into our language. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. The Talarians employ a subspace proximitydetonator. It is not detectable by our scans. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most interesting, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would like that as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because your gut tells you so? <eos> <bos> DATA: That might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forcedpulse, well into the terahertz range. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with your personal log was clever. <eos> <bos> DATA: My name is Garvin? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard was the person who first interested me in theworks of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I have subsequently become a greatadmirer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his ability tosolve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon. If the opticaltransducer were modified, we might be able to generate a hypersonicpulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that not the goal of every parent, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. His name is Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have located that cavern. <eos> <bos> DATA: How can that be, if the interface circuitry is burned out? <eos> <bos> DATA: Mostly electromagnetic, sir. Fusion generator and batteries downby thirty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I should have extended the sequence of events. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, may I remind you that during the Galen border conflict, itwas a common tactic of the Talarians was to abandon their observationcraft, rig them to self destruct <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> DATA: Deck seventeen. Doctor, you have seemedpreoccupied since we surveyed the Kallisko. <eos> <bos> DATA: It started after Doctor Crusher ordered the scanner to magnify. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are correct. Ninety two minutes, seventeen seconds havepassed since you left the room. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your sister never spoke of you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths. Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. <eos> <bos> DATA: We seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may havecaused the comas, except for the Ullians. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you would like some music? Brahms? Aurelia? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am confused. Why have I not been assigned to command a ship inthe fleet, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: This is not an efficient method for the preparation ofsustenance. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand the source of your misperception. However, this isnot sleepware and I do not have a missus. <eos> <bos> DATA: One hundred thirty seven years, Admiral, according to Starfleetrecords. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. I am notsure he is a Romulan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. My readings indicate that it will fail in approximatelytwenty two minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we could deceive his neural receptors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Their reactor core is unstable, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I don't trust him. It may be a deception. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical stylesof over three hundred concert violinists, including Heifetz, Menuhin,Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have a preference? <eos> <bos> DATA: Please come with me, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: On the contrary. I find it rather comforting. <eos> <bos> DATA: In what manner, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal, the third crosslink transfer series is complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor oftwelve. At this rate, it will have increased by a factor of two hundredby the time it reaches Lemma Two. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not my purpose. I would like to examine the remains ofAmbassador T'Pel left on the transporter pad. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, youwill begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Senior officers, please report to the Captain's Ready room. <eos> <bos> DATA: With practice, handwriting can be forged. It takes a trained eyeto notice certain discrepancies. For example, whether someone is rightor left handed! <eos> <bos> DATA: No, but there is nothing more uniquely human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who use two largestones which are continuously struck during the meal. Those at thedinner must eat until the stones are broken. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yet we are not headed for a specific colony. The coordinatesgiven are outside the Boradis system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. I believe I will stay. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid ship's records do not concur. Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Temperature is rising in the core again,Captain. Two hundred and thirty million degrees Kelvin. <eos> <bos> DATA: An uncustomary reshuffling of personnel, usually in the commandareas. The new officers have had frequent contact with the highestlevels of Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> DATA: Key universal translator, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, I am reading anomalous variationsin the molecular structure of these memory chips. Please confirm. <eos> <bos> DATA: While simultaneously, a small amount of genetically similarmaterial was left in the Ambassador's place. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, these cubes are improperly balanced. I believe theirfinal resting position would be <eos> <bos> DATA: Take Commander La Forge into custodyimmediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a connection, sir. I am now stabilising the containmentfield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Matter injector is online. Antimatter injector still locked. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. But once I have made a decision, it is your job to carry itout regardless of how you may personally feel. Any further objectionsshould be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. I do notrecall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with hisCaptain as you did a moment ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris, but Itrust my point is clear. I am one android with a single weapon. Thereare hundreds of Sheliak on the way and their weapons are far morepowerful. They may not offer you a target. They can obliterate you fromorbit. You will die never having seen the faces of your killers. Thechoice is yours. <eos> <bos> DATA: I too. <eos> <bos> DATA: Within the next five hours, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been watching Spot sleep. In the past fifteen minutes, hehas had twelve muscles spasms, which indicates he was dreaming. I haveoften wondered what Spot dreams about. His twitching and his rapidbreathing would seem to suggest anxiety, but Spot has never seen amouse or any other form of rodentia. He has never encountered aninsect, or been chased by a canine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Target two, one thousand six hundred. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother, yet the complexity ofher design indicates she was created after I was. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have much to offer a potential mate. However, wecannot grow old together because I will not grow old. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not appear to be attacking the outpost, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not have enough information. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not just a matter of control, Doctor. The signals areinteractive across a subspace domain similar to that of a Transporterbeam. I wouldhypothesise that these frequencies form the basis of the Borg'scollective consciousness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It matches Commander Worf's quantum signatureprecisely. I have remodulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inversewarp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise momentyou enter the fissure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not precisely. Geordi, does the configuration of connection nodeslook familiar to you? <eos> <bos> DATA: You're certain the Captain approved this,Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have located the Vico, sir. The vessel appears to be adrift. <eos> <bos> DATA: He denies the logic of my arguments andspeaks of structures they have built. <eos> <bos> DATA: Guinan, Lal needs to observe human behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are having difficulty penetrating theinterior. However, the radiated output suggests a coherent system ofenergy storage and utilisation. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are many fascinating records of Menthar battle strategy. They were exceptionally innovative. In fact, they were the first to usethe Kavis Teke elusive manoeuvre as well as the passive lure stratagemthat is comparable to Napoleon's <eos> <bos> DATA: We will initiate radiation protocol when necessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indubitably, sir, Indubitably. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is unacceptable, sir. I have no desire to remain here andeven if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. Thetiming will be crucial. Geordi must correctly interpret our intentions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from thelife form. <eos> <bos> DATA: I saw the plaque 'The Home of the Red Headed League' and thisrope dangling from the bell, which enabled me to deduce that MisterJabez Wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimelydemise. From this. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. I suppose none. I just wanted them. Is thatvanity? <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy? <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at all. Because we do not hear the doctor's footfalls, wemust assume that she is being carried. And since we do not hear hercries for help, we know that she is gagged. Further both sets offootfalls are heavy and masculine. One man seems to shuffle and stumblein an irregular pattern. Since the ground is level, we must concludethat Doctor Pulaski is struggling against one of her captor,sporadically knocking him off stride. Deduction, pure and simple. well,not that simple. <eos> <bos> DATA: Radioactive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I understand, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would explain why your music composition programme beganplaying The Slavonic Dances. I have been analysing the collected worksof Antonin Dvorak. <eos> <bos> DATA: The centre of a huge space federation, a population of trillions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. The Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Were you expecting a different result this time, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are picking up a polarised magneticdistortion to our port side. <eos> <bos> DATA: Subterranean caverns to the east, sir. Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have a ship? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should investigate this matter further. <eos> <bos> DATA: Primarily as Doctor Watson, you will keep a written record ofeverything I say and do. For later publication. And the famous Holmesviolin. He purchased this in a pawn shop in Tottenham Court Road forfifty five shillings, which he considered to be a very good investment. <eos> <bos> DATA: They refuse to accept further reports from you, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have confirmed Geordi's readings. The resonance signature isoriginating from somewhere beneath the asteroid's surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise to La Forge. What is your situation? <eos> <bos> DATA: Any answer would be mere speculation. This is yet another exampleof how our actions have random results. <eos> <bos> DATA: There they are again, Watson. I dare say we have caught up rathernicely with our quarry. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a great deal of electromagnetic interference. I amunable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are one hundred and fourteen people on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Both matters are subjects of protracted discussion. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is unclear what affect a photon torpedo would have on atwo-dimensional beings, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, it would appear that my programme designedto predict the emotional responses needs adjustment. Second Officers personal log, supplemental. This isthe one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the Enterprise wascommissioned. Besides the arrival of Ambassador T'Pel, other events occurring todayinclude four birthdays, two personnel transfers, a celebration of theHindu Festival of Lights, two chess tournaments, one secondary schoolplay, and four promotions. Overall, an ordinary day. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did it evoke an emotional response? <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of hissecurity precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nervous? I find this very interesting. Although I understand, intechnical terms, how life is formed, there is still a part of theprocess which eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to accesshis thought process? Does he have thoughts? You are aware of him. Is heaware of you? And when does that awareness begin? <eos> <bos> DATA: Twenty nine hours, sir. Projecting it somewhere on the westerncontinent. Thatwould destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ten seconds to stellar blast, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am operating within established parameters. How are you? <eos> <bos> DATA: I did not come for him. I came for you. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is exactly where the ion trail is leading, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish I were as confident as you, Counsellor. When I wasfighting the Borg, I felt angry, but when I think back on the incident,I realise that I was also experiencing another sensation. It was notthe same as anger, but I think it was an emotion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Well, sir, I doubt they wear red, white and blue, or lookanything like Uncle Sam. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is it not customary to request permission before entering anindividual's quarters? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand how these new fields have formed. Notransporter beam has been active in any of those areas. I cannot seethat they have anything in common. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. Outposts. The planet below was possibly one ofthem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the radiation and debris are consistent with an overloadof the station's reactor core. <eos> <bos> DATA: A change in energy readings, sir. I am reading an internalbuildup of gamma particles in <eos> <bos> DATA: They've trapped us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interfaceexperiment. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. It lost its cohesion as soon as thetransporter cycle was complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me, but I amnot capable of returning those feelings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you determined how the electron resistance across the neuralfilaments is to be resolved? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, active scanner output has increased by twenty sixpercent. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak. Thank you, Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting life readings from the planet surface, aswell as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxideemissions, indicative of combustion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, there are no protostars in this sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is necessary for us to learn the narrative from which theTamarians drawing their imagery. Given our current relations, that doesnot appear likely. <eos> <bos> DATA: Port thruster is firing. Sir, the gravitational attraction of thevarious masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. By mycalculations, we no longer have sufficient momentum to clear the debrisfield. <eos> <bos> DATA: But should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who hasdied? <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: He has been in public service since he was a young man, a senatorfor nine decades. He is considered a man of thepeople. He has sponsored many reforms. Reportedly, Romulan leadershipconsiders him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been anadvocate of peace throughout his career. <eos> <bos> DATA: I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best forher from what would be best for me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not very much, sir. The only recorded contact with the Delossystem was over two hundred years ago. A scout ship reported twoinhabited planets, one of which was on the verge of acquiring spacetravel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptablewhen all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed? <eos> <bos> DATA: In the previous thirty four trials, I brought it back once thesimulated failure occurred. This time we were talking, and I neglectedto do that. <eos> <bos> DATA: I encountered him once in the Terlina system. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I am right, sir, they are, and in this room. Their briefappearance coincided with the anyon sweep. Perhaps the anyonsneutralise the cloaking effect. Chief Brossmer. <eos> <bos> DATA: A message from planet Haven, Counsellor. They wish to beam theMiller wedding party aboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: She was special to me, sir. We were intimate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will speak to the Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The cut off has been automatically activated. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are approaching the Loren system. <eos> <bos> DATA: That being the case, I find it difficult to understand whysomeone would deliberately terminate their own existence. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have asked myself that many times as I have struggled to bemore human. Until I realised it is the struggle itself that is mostimportant. We must strive to be more than we are, Lal. It does notmatter that we will never reach our ultimate goal. The effort yieldsits own rewards. <eos> <bos> DATA: Probable cause of these variations? <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure ishard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governorof H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border. CHILTON <eos> <bos> DATA: I have insufficient information from which to form a cogenttheory, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Phase alignment is stabilised. However, sensor efficiency hasincreased by only an additional one point three percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: And I have no fear of killing you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: She already has access to the sum of human knowledge from me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cancel programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: He was called that here, but his memories indicate he travelledhere under a different name. <eos> <bos> DATA: In reference to your most recent letter,I agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information onmy programming and operation. Therefore, in response to your request,this correspondence will include a complete record of my activitiesduring a normal day, with particular emphasis on my perceptions offriendship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly. However, the beings may perceive them as negligiblenoise rather than an attempt at communication. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did I win? <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> DATA: Massive power failure to the scout ship, sir. All systems aregoing offline, including life support. <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos> <bos> DATA: The internal scans were negative. There wasno evidence of auditory anomalies anywhere on the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe, however, this situation is unique. Since the anomalydid not occur, there have already been changes in the way this timeline is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly bedifferent from the one the Captain encountered. <eos> <bos> DATA: Has been absorbed into the rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, it was not. When my status as a living being was inquestion, you fought to protect my rights, and for that I will alwaysbe grateful. The exocomps had no such advocate. If I had not acted intheir behalf, they would have been destroyed. I could not allow that tohappen, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is theoretically possible, sir, but I am unaware of any priorsituations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetarybody. There may be unforeseen difficulties. <eos> <bos> DATA: One set of footfalls are widely spaced. The other is evenlyspaced, closer together. Further, on the ground you can see theswirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumablyto see if he is being followed. Left footed means left handed. The darkcolouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type ofnon-conductive soles used by researchers experimenting withelectricity. Finally, there can be no argument, the game is afoot! Come, Watson! <eos> <bos> DATA: I am here, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting other radio transmissions,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: You sent for me, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Shuttle has cleared the bay door. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ardra, before he responds, may I have a word in private withCaptain Picard? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. It isprobable our mortality failsafe has been overridden. <eos> <bos> DATA: Drop it or I will break his neck. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Lysians have stopped transmitting, Captain. They are poweringup their disruptors. They have locked onto us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Standing by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown. Captain's log, supplemental. Some kind of weapon,which for a time took the form of Captain Paul Rice, has envelopedCommander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, your orders were to deliver the message, correct? <eos> <bos> DATA: At our first encounter, the Borg virtually ignored us when webeamed aboard their vessel. Clearly they did not consider our beingthere a threat to them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: While both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters, ourcrew locator sensed them passing here and here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do not initiate that power transfer. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is Lal, my daughter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps being human yourself, sir, you do not find them asintriguing as I. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that not a part of the human experience? Growth and change? <eos> <bos> DATA: No change, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is anything wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid, intelligentlife form, classification R3. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can see we have a lot of work to do. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must emphasize, Mister Fajo, that I consider this captivity ahostile act on your part. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: These questions suggest that we have made a successful transferof the heuristic associative pathways. You will now begin to processinformation on logic, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Youare truly becoming sentient, Lal. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. They exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns. Very possibly organic. <eos> <bos> DATA: An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant. However, that approachwould require much more time than our original plan. At least sevenweeks. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The situation is analogous to understanding the grammarof a language but none of the vocabulary. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation? <eos> <bos> DATA: Two point two milli-parsecs, bearing three zero at one four fivedegrees. <eos> <bos> DATA: Adjust the invert two percent positive. <eos> <bos> DATA: The erasures were complete. However, an analysis of the subatomicstructure revealed an almost undetectable residualpattern. In time, we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrator'sauthorisation code. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will go with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Even if I chose to do so, it is doubtful that my programmingcould be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? There is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bringany information up on it. Science two does not function either, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, a low mileage pit woofie? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will cooperate, Captain. You will cooperate or someone willdie. Who shall it be? How about the Klingon? Get another one. <eos> <bos> DATA: Whenever I am on the ship, the warp field leaves anelectromagnetic signal on my internal servo-fluid system. Between theperiod of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours thatsignature is missing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. One electron circles one proton. This is ahydrogen atom. <eos> <bos> DATA: I noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during mypresentation. Was my poetry uninteresting? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are all aware of the tape of the last Federation starship tocome in contact with the Jaradan. It graphically demonstrates whathappened when that Captain offended them. <eos> <bos> DATA: The last entry dated nine years ago, sir. By you. We are forced to abandon our starship. May she find her waywithout us. Apparently she did, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please show me the spectral analysis magnification twelve K. <eos> <bos> DATA: All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with aunique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changedthrough any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Computer, run an analysis of all known Romulantransmission formats, all bands, Identify any commonalities withdisplayed waveform. <eos> <bos> DATA: Beginning several thousand years ago, the two worlds tookdifferent paths. Ornara became technologically sophisticated, Brekkadid not. Then two hundred years ago, Ornara was stricken by adevastating plague. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no way anyone can prevent it, sir. At some future date,I will be transported back to nineteenth century Earth, where I willdie. It has occurred. It will occur. <eos> <bos> DATA: But it is only a small science station. It has limited defensivecapabilities. I do not believe it could withstand an attack from themercenary ship. Mister Worf. Send a message to the Federation outposton Calder Two. Advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vesselapproaches, they should attempt to delay it until our arrival. Ensign,take us out of orbit. Set course for the Calder system. Warp nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting theEnterprise, they are saving us six point one hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know of no one who said that, Professor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The only abnormality found during myinvestigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signalratio. Due to the circumstances, I decided to investigate thepossibility that a second transporter signal had caused thefluctuation. Although this was highly improbable, it was the onlyremaining theory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop. You must not hurt my friends. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you never told her the truth? <eos> <bos> DATA: The upper portion of the apparatus seemsto be a holding facility for the energy segments. There are hundreds,perhaps thousands of these fragments inside. I have resumed a northerlydirection. There is no evidence yet of humans. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will take the computer some time to give us a complete pictureof the anomaly's interior. I suggest we <eos> <bos> DATA: These were all accidents. I did not intend <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no indication of debris. However, the subspace signal indicates a warp engine breach. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your leeway has run out, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I bet ten. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, our options appear quite limited. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid they will not believe you either. Gia, is the well inthe town square the only source of water for this village? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanners still show nothing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: So you believe the wedding will still proceed? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composedprimarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over eightyseven million years old. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I would theorise that the Borg are somehowinterconnected through these slots and are working collectively. <eos> <bos> DATA:  <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did I? What I meant, sir, is that Daled Four rotates only onceper revolution. Therefore one side is constantly dark, and the otherside constantly light. One might surmise that the two hemispheres havedeveloped disparate cultures, which is a major cause of most wars. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you noticed another discontinuity? <eos> <bos> DATA: It was the only way to save the other two. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusuallydense. The Enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it. <eos> <bos> DATA: At present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours sevenminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently the tactile sensors are too low. I will increase theinput. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediatelyreturned to its previous dynamic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, is there a specific area you wish me to study? <eos> <bos> DATA: Which one? 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: So you agree with Okona that I am missing avery important human factor. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a warning. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to these coordinates, we havetravelled seven thousand light years <eos> <bos> DATA: I decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: You have the coordinates, Chief O'Brien. <eos> <bos> DATA: His upper spinal column has been broken in three places. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we were expecting the Decius. There is no cause foralarm. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work offiction. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One whichcommands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well? Opinions? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a reasonable explanation to your query, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack on the Vico isconsistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, it is not in the same sector, but another opening hasappeared. <eos> <bos> DATA: The anomaly is nearly collapsed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. There is far too little debris toaccount for an entire shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can release it into the ship's atmospherein a gaseous state. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the Entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the sampleswe collected, a gamma radiation scan would reveal that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Less than three hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: When the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest, Ibelieve it disrupted the space-time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our current speed, four minutes thirty seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: A standard isolation procedure would be advisable. <eos> <bos> DATA: The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imagingresolution by twenty five percent or more. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was of course not serious about calling Security. It was ajoke. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you all right, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: To go? <eos> <bos> DATA: Explosion in Jefferies tube section T ninefive. All external sensors inoperative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Impulse engines are down. <eos> <bos> DATA: Radiation levels within acceptable limits. <eos> <bos> DATA: The rupture is beginning to expandagain, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: An electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying outrepetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed. Computersare used to control, process, perform, or store <eos> <bos> DATA: I find her to be a competent officer. Highly motivated, thoughsomewhat lacking in her understanding of the theory underlying thedilithium matrix application. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there something wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by, Captain. Mister Hobson, prepare to fire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only a vague impression of some of my functions being tested here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Captain had asked the question. Can we assume youmean this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated, yes,absolutely equitable. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: With this power drain, we may have troublecommunicating with the Enterprise, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have located the Jenolen, sir. It is impacted on the surface ofthe sphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is irreversible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fortunately, we have more evidence. We were able to determinethat these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any knownTarchannen life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to teach you dancing. I have programmed acomprehensive seventeen partcourse with some interesting holographic partners. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engine room attempting to comply, sir, but they caution us <eos> <bos> DATA: It is against their nature to do so, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Both of the other ships have been destroyed. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that couldsupport life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate engineering problems. They're experiencing totalguidance system failure, with less than twenty four hours' reservepower. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Class three defensive only. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two othertachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly. The other two pulses havethe exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse. It is as if allthree originated from the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I have configured these instruments to display informationwith greater speed and efficiency than stations used by the others. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, servos off. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: This vessel is called the Enterprise. We are part of anorganization called the United Federation of Planets. TheFederation is currently in a state of war. <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, our medical facility may be able to <eos> <bos> DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. The Romulans have the same capability todirect the impact of their weapons as we do. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, locate Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: She has not complained of any discomfort. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sixteen seconds to impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood, compared to allothers felt by <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it is standard procedure that the secondofficer accompany the away team. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is Vacca Six in the Cabral sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Just as before, going to Worf first. <eos> <bos> DATA: I knew we had to have the Captain's physical pattern here, sir. He was the last one to beam out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increase anyon emissions to six thousand particles per second anddecontaminate this area. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor. Thedealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show thehighest hand, you control the next bet. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is for the greater good. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am confident they will. Commander La Forge is especially <eos> <bos> DATA: I could say home sweet home, sir, if I understood how the wordsweet applies. <eos> <bos> DATA: Temperature increase is at one hundred six percent and rising. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to do so, but I am presently in need ofinformation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Elicit a desired behaviour by advocating its opposite. Thatimplies deception, does it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep mehere. The Enterprise is certain to find me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium composition with a frozenhelium core. <eos> <bos> DATA: And he will require water. And you must provide him with a sandbox. And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat, and a goodcat. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment toalleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has been quite a day, has it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: These appear to be some kind of power wave guide conduits whichallow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is also the possibility that the phasers will supply theassimilators with what they need most. Energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two thousand five hundred degrees. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. However, the Prytt have no link designed forextraterritorial communication. Our hail may come as a quite surpriseto them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a pattern? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Lal. That would be confusing. We are taking you to theholodeck to show you several thousand composites I have programmed. Youmay choose from them. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Array is still transmitting data, sir, but it is no longersending that information to the Federation. It appears someone hasredirected its imaging systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know what to say to her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. I have not considered that. And Captain Picard hasbeen a role model in my quest to be more human. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. She was killed as a demonstration of the creature's power,without provocation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Although I am an android, I have not excluded the possibilitythat I, too, may someday marry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I still see nothing unusual. Perhaps we should activate it. <eos> <bos> DATA: The emergency transporter armbands contain a type seven phasediscriminator. It should be possible to reconfigure their subspaceemitters. <eos> <bos> DATA: The visor is active. <eos> <bos> DATA: You're becoming agitated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come, Watson. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pick one to die, Captain, or I kill them both. RO <eos> <bos> DATA: This is puzzling. Three more chroniton fields have formed aboardthe Enterprise in the last hour. <eos> <bos> DATA: I fail to understand why this is amusing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am reading an open panel. K twelve, J nine,deck thirty. <eos> <bos> DATA: There. I have instructed the computer to giveus a Sherlock Holmes-type problem, but not one written specifically bySir Arthur Conan Doyle. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would tend to agree. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. You are constantly working on similarelectronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. My brother has made that possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Hathawaywill not survive. <eos> <bos> DATA: I busted him up. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong, sir? Alone, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Hooey? Ah, as in hogwash, malarky, jive. An intentionalfabrication. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, current location of Commander LaForge? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. Perhaps I should remain and further entertain our guest. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. We must vary shield shape and strength as rapidly aspossible. Maximum shields will only speed the ship's takeover. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of <eos> <bos> DATA: I can think of no motive for such a pretense. <eos> <bos> DATA: At the present rate, containment failure willoccur in approximately nine minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increase the power. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed onto the kittens. I do not know why. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was attacked by another alien, sir. I was unable to prevent thepower transfer. It cannot be disengaged, sir. A core breach is againimminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: If it is harming you, we must return. Enterprise, respond. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am a Frenchman. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are clear. We are out of the void. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you for your co-operation. 1 <eos> <bos> DATA: This is home, Lal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither <eos> <bos> DATA: A chocolate sundae, for example. Although I do not speak frompersonal experience, I have seen it have a profound psychologicalimpact. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: The Federation has charted but not explored several class Mplanets in that area. Any one of these planets might well serve as abase. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it a security vessel from the planet Straleb. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I agree that Tam's motives are trustworthy, and I do notbelieve it is possible that he will act against us, or will cause TinMan to act against us out of malice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, I will be there shortly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds to impact, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must remind you that our objective is to bring Tin Man out ofdanger and report our findings to Starfleet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Probe launch successful. Telemetrytransmissions are being received. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I disturbing you? <eos> <bos> DATA: The pods are equipped with fusion-generated pulse lasers andminimal shielding. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no malfunction in any of the mainsystems, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be protecting itself. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no need for companionship. However I do require somesupplies. <eos> <bos> DATA: On screen. <eos> <bos> DATA: The flow regulator is functioning properly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe. <eos> <bos> DATA: A possibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of the risks involved. But I can think of no other wayto investigate my experience. Will you help? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your courtesy is appreciated, sir. But I am aware that I do noteffectively convey the fear called for in this scene. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is it? <eos> <bos> DATA: This is Commander Data. Go ahead, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was there anything else in the lab capable of creating this kindof energy discharge? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have analysed the probe's sensor logs. There are norecord to indicate the presence of a living human on board the Raman. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask the purpose of your request? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, Iwould not be the instrument of his death. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is what humans call a truism. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: This is the third time I have refreshed your memory. Do you wishto rescind our agreement? <eos> <bos> DATA: The neural link will be established in three stages. Doctor, Isuggest you closely observe Captain Picard's lifesigns, while at eachstage Chief O'Brien monitors my positronic matrix activity. Counsellor,hopefully, you will be able to determine whether I am reaching CaptainPicard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you realise that Commander Riker'shypotenuse question tricked you into showing your knowledge was greaterthan you were indicating? <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering to Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Such a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays,science labs one, four, and sixteen, or any of the bridge sciencestations. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel appears undamaged, sir. Its defences are apparentlyable to absorb incoming matter and energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are not receiving Rana Four's call sign. <eos> <bos> DATA: There does appear to be a recurring motif. <eos> <bos> DATA: Manipulate the synchronic distortion. <eos> <bos> DATA: The destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weaponsof the period. <eos> <bos> DATA: Probes ready, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ihave several examples of Commander Riker's battle technique. At theAcademy, he calculated a sensory blind spot on a Tholian vessel and hidwithin it during a battle simulation. And as a lieutenant aboard thePotemkin, his solution to a crisis was to shut down all power, and hangover a planet's magnetic poles, thus confusing his opponent's sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ship'santi-matter, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will know in a moment, sir. According tocalculations, the next time effect will occur in one minute thirtyseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe's field intensity is continuing to build, sir. We arein danger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: The Federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths. Icannot allow that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Considering the rate at which you imbibe, sir, is your lineage atall mixed with human? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe, sir, that was the first timeoutsiders have witnessed the Klingon death ritual. <eos> <bos> DATA: The apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support thatassumption. As with the other terms used by the Tamarian, this appearsto be a proper noun. The name clearly carries a meaning for them. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can reverse the polarity of their forcefields to isolate thisroom. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Warp enginesare coming back online. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have attempted to trace the message Remmick wassending. I believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Champagne? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a question, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Me. It's me. <eos> <bos> DATA: How so? <eos> <bos> DATA: File names can be anything, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe Lieutenant Worf understands all the nuances ofthis betting procedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. We are a family, Lal. Chair. To sit in. Sit. Good. Painting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ninety seconds remaining. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have no indication of a transmission of any kind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I would like to remind you of our concert this eveningin Ten Forward. We will perform Chopin's Trio in G Minor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Disruptors would be ineffectual. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must free the crewmen. She appears to be our best hope ofdoing so. In addition, I have become used to her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. Data to Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: The saline fluid is their circuitry, and to prevent its loss,they killed Malencon. <eos> <bos> DATA: No life signs, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: The answer is yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: The running youth was a ploy. The real crime is here. And theintended victim is that man. Mister Jabez Wilson, employee of the RedHeaded League, dupe of a gang of criminals. <eos> <bos> DATA: I fold as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: Timothy, androids do not lie. <eos> <bos> DATA: I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are anadvanced and most honourable race. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly. I will attempt to resequence the signal. Begin runninga search for a decryption key. <eos> <bos> DATA: Many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friendsand family. I could access one of those. <eos> <bos> DATA: So a person fills in missing pieces of the puzzle with his ownpersonality, resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct andintuition as on fact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Q entity, sir. It is identical to the grid we encounteredwhen <eos> <bos> DATA: The Lantree's First Officer exposed your children to Thelusianflu for the first time. Their active immune systems set out to attackthe virus, and once it was triggered, it kept going. The antibodycreated an unexpected side-effect. It alters the genetic make-up ofnormal humans. This is a comparison of the normal and altered DNA. These are the two molecules that have been transposed. <eos> <bos> DATA: There appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour,approximately one degree Celsius. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a memory record of the entire lecture, Counsellor. I canrepeat the portions you missed, if you <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but use of sickbay equipment is limited to ship'smedical personnel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting metaphor, Doctor. What is your idea? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is taking too long. We should have been there by now. He ismanipulating you. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know that. This is just a thing, and things can be replaced. Lives cannot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, why should a king wish to pass as a commoner? If he isthe leader, should he not be leading? <eos> <bos> DATA: Our sensors show an immense volume of energy emanating deepwithin the planet, and concentrated near Manheim's remaininglaboratory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eleven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Merely throwing myself into the part, Watson. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. <eos> <bos> DATA: I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Klingon vessel is within range, sir. They are requestingvisual contact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Never. I judge Lore to be superior in that desire. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask why, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed, sir. Their customs concerning guests make it muchpreferable. <eos> <bos> DATA: At warp one, in three days, four hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: The same distance could be achieved in a matter of secondsthrough the wormhole. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is theoretically true, but even at this level of input youare already experiencing dangerous neural feedback. <eos> <bos> DATA: Target one is emitting two thousand cubicmetres per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifty two seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Direct hit. Their weapon systems are down. <eos> <bos> DATA: The object's enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetricinterference. That might have prevented our sensors from detecting itbefore we dropped out of warp. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will function sufficiently to stop Lore, Doctor <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirteenth Century, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am incapable of any feeling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. However, thereis no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause theinterference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dancing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Its cargo holds are empty. The readout shows its guidance systemis malfunctioning. The pilot is attempting to hold course manually. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblerscaught up in a web of crime, corruption and deceit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Muskets are appropriate to the 1790 to 1800 French army uniform,sir. But it is hardly a weapon by our standards. A lead ball propelledby gunpowder. One hundred metres at best with any accuracy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only one race uses that device, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be acceptable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Bring allsystems online and direct full power to the shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Similar in specifications and capabilities, but a variation inmarkings and hailing language. <eos> <bos> DATA: The anomaly cannot be seen, but I believe I can enhance it with awarp field to make it visible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Freeze. Darmok. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlike a canine, Spot does not respond to verbal commands. Goodbye, Spot. He will needto be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement number twenty five. <eos> <bos> DATA: In an effort to be helpful, I am attempting to calculate thevariables involved in a successful marriage. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I have entered my Expressionistic phase. This is myinterpretation of the Battle of HarOS. <eos> <bos> DATA: Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to saya ritual farewell to those you call friends. I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me asthough I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. Heaccepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. ButI do not know how to say goodbye. RO <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are configured for planetary probe, sir. Ready forlaunch. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I am not mistaken. <eos> <bos> DATA: When Worf's shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantumfissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break in thebarriers between quantum realties. Worf was thrown into a state ofquantum flux. He immediately shifted into other realities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I am studying several new techniques. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then the initial encounter was solely for the purpose ofgathering information. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. We'll be returning to the beam-out point shortly. <eos> <bos> DATA: How were you able to accomplish the repair soquickly? <eos> <bos> DATA: To which dinner was the Captain referring, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is curious that I was so easily misled. <eos> <bos> DATA: As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form replacingother less complex pathways. It was very disorienting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry readingthis afternoon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aceton assimilators are a primitive generator which can drainpower from distant sources. <eos> <bos> DATA: I walked here from the mountains. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. That is not correct. My creator Doctor Soong, gave me aprogramme which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I havea conscience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack. <eos> <bos> DATA: Especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted, sir, wassomehow distorted. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we have arrived at Tanuga Four. The away team hascompleted its survey of Doctor Apgar's work and is ready to return tothe ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, allow me. Please. Sarjenka, no one will harm you. These are my friends. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, this is intriguing. I have seenmalfunctions <eos> <bos> DATA: By matching gene types, Starfleet wasable to identify the boy as Jeremiah Rossa. <eos> <bos> DATA: Alert starbase. Inform them we are abandoningthe ship. Tell them why. Initiate automated sequence for departure. Setcourse and speed course and speed to put maximum distance between theEnterprise and any inhabited planets. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twentythree hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps these artefacts have a special value to the Romulans. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration ofnitrium, and project it toward one of the asteroids. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not possible. Something is wrong. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. It is normally occupied by Captain Picard, Commander Riker,and Counsellor Troi. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, but I will take your word for it. It is very amusing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a ship in the Neutral Zone. Configuration, Romulan warbird. <eos> <bos> DATA: Some sort of scanning device, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Darling, you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the first day wemet. I believe I am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of thegalaxy. Now, you relax. Put your feet up and I will take care ofeverything. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will take some time to locate them, sir. They are onundesignated manoeuvres in the Pheben system. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must reiterate, it would be better if Iwent alone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no scarring on the planet surface that would denoteheavy construction of any kind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Still no readings of any kind, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why did you attack us? <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree the existence of such a message is remote, but I believewe should check. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is another temporal disturbancedirectly behind us. <eos> <bos> DATA: The resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible withour power systems. Warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded. I am attempting to compensate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have made micro-tomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber,the hatch mounting, the blast pattern from the explosion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the destroyer is hailing us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff dissolved your relationship, Isaw an excellent opportunity to study that aspect of human intimacy. Asyour friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive in times of need. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acceptable or not, sir, it is the truth. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and beginrepairs of the starboard power coupling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I wascausing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up. Doctor Freud, I am curious. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are several archaeological sites inthis sector containing ruins which are Romulan in origin. These are thelocations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: From any particular point of view, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: With one exception, sir. The particles would be converted into ahigh energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then re-directharmlessly into space. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I've recommended such a course, butthere are several wounded people and Doctor Crusher <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a very potent experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, our sensors are being severely affected by the sunflares. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I thought you might want to know why I would be willingto risk your life for several small machines. <eos> <bos> DATA: A remarkable experience, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: My duty requires me to intercede. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You simply do not understand. In a quest such as ours, sacrificeshave to be made. It is regrettable, but the greater good must beserved. Give me your visor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please respond. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you will have to open it for me. <eos> <bos> DATA: There do seem to be some variations on the quantum level. She canuse contractions. I cannot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately twelve seconds, sir. Hull stresses one hundredtwenty percent above tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating emergency landing procedures. <eos> <bos> DATA: Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos> <bos> DATA: He has provided important theoretical guidance for Geordi'sanalysis of the Bre'el satellite, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors and secondary generators are offline. Life support downto sixty seven percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Casualties reported on deck twelve. Sickbay responding. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. We are well within tolerance levels. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, Rhomboid Dronegar sector would put us at considerabledistance from Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: The efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, the twenty ninth is the only one I cannot bypass. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our current speed, approximately thirty seven hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonise thisplanet, and are unwilling to share it with humans. If you are stillhere when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have seen that echoes, or after-images, from previous loopsappear as distortions in the dekyon field. We may be able to send adeliberate echo into the next loop. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I'm afraid the only entry we haveon Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can access the power grid here. I will attempt to depolarisethe grid by using a low frequency inversion field. It may disengage thenodes without destroying them. <eos> <bos> DATA: They're either unaware of me or choosingto ignore me. I am moving approximately ten metres north of my startingposition to observe more closely. <eos> <bos> DATA: What will become of the resonator, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Display sensor schematic. Display sensor sweep, maximum range. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Ferengi report their containment field iscollapsing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe I am qualified to express an opinion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then we sat on the sand for some time and observed How the oceans that cover the world were perturbed By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead 'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you said. I began to expound upon tidal effects When you asked me to stop, looking somewhat perplexed. So I did not explain why the sunset turns red And we watched the occurrence, in silence, instead. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android, Mistress, although anatomically I am a male. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no life signs. However, there are several small poweremanations, and life support is still functioning on minimal levels. <eos> <bos> DATA: High level gamma radiation would kill them, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The retro virus is working, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two, prepare for docking. Level one precautionsremain in effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Access your data bank on sexuality, level two. That will definethe parameters. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish to cash in, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The range is at least several thousand light years. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, please give us Klingon personnel appropriate to thisevent. <eos> <bos> DATA: With pleasure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I had every right, Captain. I am man, he is machine. There is noquestion who must live and what must die. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have used a verbal contraction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, without communication, we should beam upimmediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard amedical ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew. A warp core breach moves at a much faster rate. The motion of the cloudis within my visual detection threshold. At its current expansion rate,it will consume the Enterprise in approximately nine hours, seventeenminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I think I know what the Captain's talking about. If I'm notmistaken, he's describing a paradox. <eos> <bos> DATA: External radiation levels increasing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Matter valves are open and operating. Magnetic containment ofantimatter pods is constant. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not, unfortunately. It means only the knowledge they hadaccumulated. Actually, I am quite deficient in some basic humaninformation. Sneezing, for example. <eos> <bos> DATA: As the probe went into orbit around NelvanaThree, it began picking up low level subspace radio emissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your friendship with me was part of the deception, was it not? You misled me at each step, and yet I was completely unaware. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ship's computer is accepting navigational inputs from theshuttle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor? I require your advice as a successfulparent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering, display computer core processor four five one,element zero two nine nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate all of their systems are armed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship is intact, sir, with no indication of structural damage. <eos> <bos> DATA: He appears to be in some kind of stasis. <eos> <bos> DATA: The event is approximately zero point one light years indiameter, and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryonradiation. It appears to be what Rabal and Serova predicted, a subspacerift. <eos> <bos> DATA: Maintaining field integrity will be difficult, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: The timing will be critical. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg, I felt something. Ibelieve it was pleasure. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was that funny? Accessing. Ah. Burns and Allen, Roxy Theater, NewYork City, 1932. It still works. Then there was the one about the girlin the nudist colony that nothing looked good on? <eos> <bos> DATA: The number of the cards and their values remain quite constant. What would be the purpose in counting them? <eos> <bos> DATA: In a sense, you were her grandmother. Would you like to practicenow? <eos> <bos> DATA: What was your response? <eos> <bos> DATA: We are within four kilometres of the magmapocket. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I am able to resume my duties. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, is this it? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It is of sufficient size and density to causeplanetwide damage. <eos> <bos> DATA: Warp five, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The structure is located at the centre of the vegetation. <eos> <bos> DATA: The amplitude is still rising, Captain. Resonance is approachingcritical. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. I will call up the results I have achieved this far foryou to study. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far sideof Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. The Tamarian's bioscan is becoming unreadable. He maybe dead, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ancient Doosodarians. Much of their poetry contained suchlacunae or empty spaces. Often these pauses measured several days inlength, during which poet and audience were encouraged to fullyacknowledge the emptiness of the experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unchanged, sir. They appear to be making no attempt to stop us. <eos> <bos> DATA: This asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for astarship to enter. It is possible the Pegasus drifted into theasteroid's gravitational field and was pulled down into one of thefissures. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is not a speculation, Doctor. We are notwhere the Barzans said we should be, which would indicate <eos> <bos> DATA: Freeze. Computer, search for the term Tanagra. All databases. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we coast into the rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have found the quantum flux in Worf's cellular extends tothe subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. In essence,Captain, Mister Worf does not belong in our universe. <eos> <bos> DATA: You've constructed a positronic brain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it isalive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because you are my child. <eos> <bos> DATA: The third planet of the Alpha Onias system. Our reports list itas presently uninhabited. Perhaps reports were incorrect, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites andgiven the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm here to brief you on what he plans. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. Stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: The signal is a standard mathematical progression. It does notcarry a specific message. <eos> <bos> DATA: Happy birthday, Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, may I ask a favour of you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I am fortunate, sir, to be spared the emotionalconsequences. <eos> <bos> DATA: Loyalty is not the issue, Commander. There is nothing wrong withCaptain Picard or the ship's logs. Therefore there must be somethingwrong with your original assumption. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is this significant, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is all a question of probabilities. Quitesimple, really, if one bets with any sequential consistency. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exocomps? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of anactual planet on the other side of the wormhole. We could survey thenearby stars for such a planet. It would require approximately sixdays, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid. Theyhave switched to their lateral sensor array. Beginning another scan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are, to collaborate inproducing an explosion. If hydrogen is combined with another element,calendenium for example, it is extremely volatile. But would themessage mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together. Wehad a considerable number of conversations. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is insisting on attending to <eos> <bos> DATA: She is only two weeks old. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am many things. Scholar, Artist, philosopher, lover, genius. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is perplexing to me that the Ullians'ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized. If an event wereimportant enough to be recovered, why would it have been forgotten? <eos> <bos> DATA: This is a big decision <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready now, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Further energy emissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: The close pass by the weapons must have disrupted ourcommunicators. <eos> <bos> DATA: Salia of Daled Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Minor damage to one ship. Its shields are holding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ejector systems are offline. Core breach is imminent <eos> <bos> DATA: Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? 3 <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors at maximum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Three hundred twenty seven, to our knowledge. We can probablyachieve an exact match with a random computer search. It will takeapproximately three hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: This new concentration of energy was detectedonly after the surrounding material became inert. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will both be destroyed by the explosion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. Captain, I believe we should decontaminate this roombefore getting underway. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, Idiscovered that my memory banks contained the contents of theirjournals and logs. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am referring to the great detective's credo, sir. I quote, wemust fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail,whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reasoning. From the general to the specific. Is that not the verydefinition of deduction? Is that not the way Sherlock Holmes worked? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no trick. I had no magic. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructiveforce. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not laughing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid if I have another waking dream, I might injure him. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are not responding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, all systems are back under helm control. The computerhas returned to normal functioning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not as such. However, even among humans, friendship is sometimesless an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity. <eos> <bos> DATA: The total mass of the moon would remain the same, Commander, andthe impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over aneven wider area. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate that the large circle is aportal or airlock, possibly leading to the interior of the sphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correctmany malfunctions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Who in this case sail the galaxy in search of mercantile andterritorial opportunity. <eos> <bos> DATA: I find I am having difficulty deciding what kind of service tohave. Do you have any suggestions? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will do my best, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are within visual range of the transport, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, an unidentified <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the equipment is no longer functioning. However, theinformation currently displayed indicates that there was a massivepower surge in Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, have you completed themetallurgical scan of the Array? <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seenothers around me age. Until now it has been theoretically possible thatI would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might findthis attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I amartificial. <eos> <bos> DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show that the ship is still intact. However, sixty fivepercent of it is contained within the asteroid. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready, sir. Temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees. Minus two hundred degrees, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will compare my autonomic logs with the ship's chronometer. Perhaps we have overlooked something. <eos> <bos> DATA: The remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No! <eos> <bos> DATA: Based on the information gathered byCommander Riker's tricorder, we have determined that the molecularstructure of the alien life forms is solanogen-based. <eos> <bos> DATA: The object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to geta precise reading. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have created twenty three individual illustrations in the pastsix hours, twenty seven minutes. I believe you could say I have beeninspired. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was discovered twenty six years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: They could penetrate the molecular fabric of my hand-coveringinto my nerve circuitry, and interface with my verbal programs. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is an interesting. It would give them something in common. I do not understand, Counsellor. To what is he referring? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Her records were shipped by way of Starfleetheadquarters. They have not caught up with us yet. <eos> <bos> DATA: As far as I can determine, sir, very little. There are fourcolonies in theBoradis system, as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout thesector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around ayoung woman named Jenina. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> DATA: And acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Armaments consist of four laser cannons and thirty nine cobaltfusion warheads with magnetic propulsion. Defensive shield output isfour point three kilojoules. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify atransmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near GalorndonCore twelve hours ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: But no sound of power. No equipment. <eos> <bos> DATA: In order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduledobservations, additional processing time will be required. <eos> <bos> DATA: A type of weapon. Unfortunately it does not function in thepresence of hyperonic radiation. I will have to be innovative. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not capable of either of those functions. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation. <eos> <bos> DATA: How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has itsown unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wonder if that is so. <eos> <bos> DATA: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I amnot that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not possible. My internal chronometer indicates you havebeen gone for exactly one minute, fifteen seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Its line is both fluid and formal, yet retains an unpremeditatedquality. The tactility of its surfaceembellishment is evocative of the neo-primitive period in Tyrineanblade carving. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was unusually compact, yet extremely powerful. Its recordedwind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is why you must choose a gender, Lal, to complete yourappearance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have completed the spectralevaluation of the outer shell. Our survey of this protostar iscomplete. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method ofdrawing the audience into the plight of your character. You gave atruly realistic interpretation of multi-infarct dementia. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Watson, we are about to have guests. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hold very still, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I apologise for my premature assumption. This particularpoem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes. You may experience theemptiness with me if you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Commander, but sensors have not yet locked onto its exactwhereabouts. <eos> <bos> DATA: That seems to be it's method of reprogramming, Captain. Each boltof light consists of negatively and positively charged ions. A seriesof programme instructions, as it were. It seems to have a quickerrapport with our computers than we have. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, Ithink the king is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as itdoth to me, in his nakedness he appears but a man. Therefore, hisfears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet no manshould possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,should dishearten his army. <eos> <bos> DATA: Drema Four has been enduring the same geological stresses we havefound in the other systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is conceivable, sir, but it would requirealtering the pathway from the root command <eos> <bos> DATA: The system automatically provides for self-correction, Captain. There has not been a systems-wide technological failure on a starshipin seventy nine years. <eos> <bos> DATA: What about the weapons? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ruah Four is a class-M planet. Sixty seven percent of its surfaceis covered with water. Its landmass contains multiple animal species,including a genus of proto-hominids. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, warp engines are back online. We areready to commence restart sequences. Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: There appears to be a command path discontinuity. I shall attemptto rewrite the locator subroutine. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, it does not. I do not feel pleasure. I am only anandroid. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

After an eight point three second burst from the dish,we'll discharge all taps through the phasers. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is difficult to explain. Counsellor Troi's body was a cake. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we canattain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: My Watson? <eos> <bos> DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I amCommander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sarjenka? Wait! I'm Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Old things? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, it indicates a synchronic distortion in the areasemanating <eos> <bos> DATA: A supposition not supported by the transporter records. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, run fluidic sensor diagnostic. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Crystalline Entity is moving away, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a bright side, Geordi. You will have me to talk to. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are his family. <eos> <bos> DATA: These are various outposts and starbases where I have detectedunusual activity over the past few months. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a complete memory record of that day. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer. Programme an audience appropriate to this venue. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish we were able to learn more about them,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I can safely traverse the distance. <eos> <bos> DATA: She said I spoiled the joke. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not according to their computer. I have also accessed Starfleetrecords. There is no doctor currently serving in Starfleet namedQuaice. In fact, I can find no service record whatsoever. There are nobirth records with that name. I find no <eos> <bos> DATA: You sent for me, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was never a boy. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you are correct, you are placing yourself in grave danger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor, but if I may make a supposition, I do not believehis message was intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course ofaction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you forgotten, Geordi, that my sensory inputs are notprogrammed to experience pain? <eos> <bos> DATA: But is not honesty always the preferred choice? <eos> <bos> DATA: I did nothing. The problem seems to have corrected itself. <eos> <bos> DATA: If what the Professor has given me isaccurate, it is possible to repair the damage. But it must be perfectlytimed to coincide with another time distortion episode. RIKER <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Picard, my interpretation of Ventaxian law suggests underthese circumstances, this is acceptable. Your objection is overruled. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can. My orders were to search for abnormal patterns inStarfleet's directives. I believe I have found just that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed. Or, stated more correctly, I wanted you to see me. <eos> <bos> DATA: My skills seemed appropriate <eos> <bos> DATA: According to the terms of the Klingon-Federation Treaty, Koralhas every right to free transit through Federation space. We cannotboard or search his vessel without cause. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will see your ten, and raise you twenty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Careful, Commander, they're much strongerthan <eos> <bos> DATA: Closing on the new signal, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correction. The second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean,now dry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not. <eos> <bos> DATA: From the Devoras. <eos> <bos> DATA: As is the case with many natural growth processes, it isdifficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage. <eos> <bos> DATA: And were the Ullians present? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, if you could explain <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, containment field down on deck thirtysix. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Borg are extremely computer dependent. A systems failure willdestroy them. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the Doctor means is that humans enter what is known asREM sleep. Rapid eye movement. It is the level ofbrain wave activity at which one dreams. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. Do you read me, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: My apologies. It seems my primary speech processors areexperiencing a minor fluctuation. I will have it corrected in a moment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: Single digits on each cube are not at all desirable. <eos> <bos> DATA: You condone homicide, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However, fromwhat I know of him by his memories and his writing, I do not believe hewould be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now youhave destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believehe would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sadnow. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I saw a straw coming out of your head. <eos> <bos> DATA: Method of propulsion is unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I expected to make new friends. <eos> <bos> DATA: You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need anothertreatment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, Worf is entering the fissure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this end of the wormhole iscurrently stable, but the other end apparently shifts positionsperiodically. <eos> <bos> DATA: The record will stand until the year 2026, when a shortstop forthe London Kings <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Crystalline. Mostly inert. Nothing to write home about. <eos> <bos> DATA: And yet you put yourself at risk. <eos> <bos> DATA: The aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion anddirect it to a specific time and place. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have I said something to offend you? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays,sir. We will have the results of the analysis in approximately tenminutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Worf, assemble your security team in Sickbay. <eos> <bos> DATA: In fact, they seem to be appearing at random. <eos> <bos> DATA: In a manner of speaking. The term artificial lifeform would bemore accurate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot explain it. It is not an image I saw during my vision. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increase magnification, factor one thousand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Chief O'Brien talks to me. Keiko talks to you. Why do they nottalk to each other? <eos> <bos> DATA: You cannot survive in this. <eos> <bos> DATA: But he admitted to an alliance with the Crystal Entity. To gainits favour, he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed theEnterprise as well had I not <eos> <bos> DATA: An accurate description of humans, sir. You are over ninety percent water surrounded by a flexible container. <eos> <bos> DATA: As we continue, Captain, they are virtually learning the conceptof communication. Each new generation is making modifications. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface andhuman life signs. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. We must leave, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is precisely what happened to Lal in school. How did youhelp him? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are nearing the periphery ofSector twenty one five oh three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only to say that she was lucky to have escaped. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is your condition, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Commander, as Acting First Officer, I must questionyour decision to accompany the away team. If Captain Picard were here <eos> <bos> DATA: The away team is returning to the Enterprise, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Four seconds to arrival, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Forty five seconds remaining. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain I do. Perhaps you could clarify them for me? <eos> <bos> DATA: And the German nation red, black and gold. The Italians green,white and red. The British <eos> <bos> DATA: It is 'Stars and Stripes Forever'. sir, by John Phillip Sousa, apopular American composer of band music in the early twentieth century. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary data suggests it is stillcapable of supporting life. We have been unable to find definite signsof current habitation. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no handholds in the rock face. We are going to have tojump. <eos> <bos> DATA: The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of theface, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Counsellor. He does know. Mister Worf, prepareto drop the shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker is correct. While the information imparted tocadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleetofficers, it nevertheless requires a significant period ofsupplementary systems training and situational disciplines. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeterminate. Propulsion appears to employ a gaseous corefission reactor, but it is not functioning. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, if it were possible to lock onto the object, it mightrematerialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter. <eos> <bos> DATA: It should be interesting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. A voice only transmission from the Lantree, aFederation supply ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: The field imbalance has subsided. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The effect has been localised to within two kilometresof the wavefront. <eos> <bos> DATA: The polarity is not compatible. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. If we draw <eos> <bos> DATA: On the contrary, dear colleague. On their return, they drewmedical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds andabrasions on these life forms. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see. From limitless options I am reduced to none, or ratherone. I can only hope that Commander Maddox is more capable than itwould appear. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a problem, Ensign? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is here, at this doorway. A legal intercessor's office. Thename is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be one of his relatives. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but what is even more difficult is to get each side tolisten, really listen to each other, and to understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beacon is in place, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are approaching the Devron system,Captain. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directlyahead. <eos> <bos> DATA: And what Klingons do to their children <eos> <bos> DATA: Four days, eleven hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Given the selections, I prefer four seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: You're becoming agitated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservationis shared by most life forms? <eos> <bos> DATA: Strange, sir. There's no emergency signal from the shuttle asyet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity betweenthe three time periods the Captain hasvisited, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Iconian programme is attempting to rewrite my software. Physical manifestations, blindness, motor con <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain Thomas Halloway. Perhaps I should escort you to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> DATA: The unhatched eggs of a large scaleless <eos> <bos> DATA: You will only harm Counsellor Troi's body. <eos> <bos> DATA: Theoretically it is possible, sir. But it would take severalhours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eventually, sir. I am working on it now but the number ofpermutations is almost endless. <eos> <bos> DATA: Personal Log, supplemental. CommanderMaddox, there are still many dynamics of social interaction which I donot understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space. Twoships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero fiveone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading human life forms. <eos> <bos> DATA: Remember, Geordi, if the implementation is off by a millisecond <eos> <bos> DATA: Most intriguing again, sir. The place that this vessel was firingupon was not the Farpoint starbase, but the home of those whoconstructed. Sorry, sir. I seem to be commenting on everything. <eos> <bos> DATA: Through deduction, sir. Lieutenant Barclay and I tried totransport a simulated object off the holodeck, something that has neverbeen attempted. Since the transporter itself is a simulation, thecomputer had no real data from which to create the transport logs. <eos> <bos> DATA: I could organise your closets for you. I have found that bygrouping apparel first by function, and then by colour from light todark, one can more easily find one's desired choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend toward a more egalitariansociety is partly responsible, eh? <eos> <bos> DATA: Several different programs are running simultaneously. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have kept that somewhat vague, sir, but Sarjenka, that is hername, has been quite specific, telling me details of her family andfriends. And interspersed among these confidences have been somealarming references. <eos> <bos> DATA: The safest and most logical decision in this situation is tocontact Starfleet and await further instructions. However, based onpast experience, I project only a seventeen percent chance CaptainPicard will choose that alternative. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beam is coming from the centre of the vortex. Sensors show itto be only a mass of energy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the key to understanding the ship's behaviour lies inthe holodeck. All of the connection nodes intersect at that location. It is clearly some kind of processing centre. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense ofindividuality to them. It nearly destroyed them. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonicinterference. It is impossible to obtain a positive lock on thebulkheads. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know my name. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. It is becoming easier. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently no one. Helm and navigation controls are notfunctioning. Our speed is now warp seven point three and holding. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must leave now. <eos> <bos> DATA: A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationshipbetween anti-time and normal time is analogous to the relationshipbetween antimatter and normal matter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, at that distance, the ship will not withstand the magneticfields and radiation. We will not survive. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our present speed, three hours, twenty minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The planet's atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonicreactions are destroying it. The stratosphere is already breaking down. There are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface. Iestimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirtyeight hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inquiry. The word snoop? <eos> <bos> DATA: It has engaged the Borg at Wolf three fiftynine, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you can see, sir, there's nothing there. <eos> <bos> DATA: One fact is clear, however. The distortion was growing instrength. If we had remained at our original position one point sevenseconds longer, the distortion would have ruptured our warp core. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was I seen leaving? <eos> <bos> DATA: And the reason for that, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm sorry, sir, but Stellar Cartography has requested acommunications blackout while they run an experiment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothyremembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis ofshield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then what is the difference between sending the message anddelivering it personally? <eos> <bos> DATA: The saucer module is now entering orbit with us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel, sir. Thedimensions this one occupies allows them to be, well, to be in severalplaces at once. But they consider this entire star cluster to betheirs. It was probablyunwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area. Ofcourse, there are three thousand four other planets inthis star cluster in which we could have colonised. The largest andclosest <eos> <bos> DATA: One can swim in moonlight? <eos> <bos> DATA: We perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was unaware of having caused any inconvenience, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have only enough power to emit a hydrogenstream for that amount of time. They must understand that they willhave to detonate it immediately. Captain, we are ready to implement theplan. <eos> <bos> DATA: There was no evidence to suggest sabotage. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have cleared the shock wave. However, tetryon flux in the areais increasing rapidly. <eos> <bos> DATA: One of these two logs is a forgery, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert ourbodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again <eos> <bos> DATA: It is too early to tell if the nano-cortical fibres performedtheir function. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see, sir. Oh, I see, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. I am an android. Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: But why do you ask the question? Since her death, I have beenasked several times to define how well I knew Lieutenant Aster. And Iheard you ask Wesley on the Bridge how well he knew Jeremy. Does thequestion of familiarity have some bearing on death? <eos> <bos> DATA:  <eos> <bos> DATA: You do not wish to continue our lovers quarrel? <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is nothing here of relevance. I do not see how thisconnects with the disappearance of the Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no prior memory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, your original hypothesis is correct. Iconian is the parent tongue of a language family which consists ofIccobar, Dewan and Dinasian. I have constructed a basic workingunderstanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother,father, child, home, tribe, food, life, death, yours, ours, mine <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I am the only one. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have lost contact, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is our theory. We believe unauthorised access was made sixdays ago. The imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching theArray. <eos> <bos> DATA: Other evidence lends credence to that theory, Captain. A reviewof the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well withinnormal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are attempting to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there willbe no more quakes, no morevolcanoes. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is water. A substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen <eos> <bos> DATA: Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unfamiliar with that term. <eos> <bos> DATA: An aggregate field of plane-polarised objectshas just appeared. And disappeared. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It is difficult to localize. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, sir. You are dismantling the primary power conduit. Imust ask you to stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, Lieutenant Commander Data here. Please excuse theunusual interruption, but under the circumstances I thought thatpatching communications through the holodeck programme would be lessobtrusive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Forced spectrum communications are spotty at best, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correction, sir, that's blown out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twelve seconds to critical. <eos> <bos> DATA: Coming in now, sir. The probe is within visual range of theplanet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, by taking this action you risk charges ofassault, theft, piracy, and treason. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hair brush. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are approaching the Devolinsystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely,given the time frame. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, that would not be appropriate. Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at theedge of the Neutral Zone, where we will now have an opportunity tolearn firsthand what happened to our distant outpost. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe each slot is designed for a specific Borg. Here is where the connection is made. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since we have no contact with the Romulans for fifty three years,seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information wedo have, is out of date. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, at twenty million kilometres, our shields will only beeffective for eighteen minutes. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: Difficult? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. <eos> <bos> DATA: Four days at warp six, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: This appears to be the instrument Doctor Manheim described. Itshould confirm when the next time effect will occur. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. It is emitting an unusual signal. Captain,it is beginning to generate a verteron field. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, it is more curiosity, sir. I doubt that they expect us toabide by their value systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. It is very expressive. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have had a considerable spectrum of occupations. <eos> <bos> DATA: I accept. <eos> <bos> DATA: Talk. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is the way I think of him, sir. My only living relative, nolonger living. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. Initiating tachyon pulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was capturedwhile leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of aheart attack before his trial ended. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would like to join the game. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. But no longer. Through joining they have been healed. Griefhas been transmuted to joy. Loneliness to belonging. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no rational justification for this course. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I have been analysing the nucleonic beam. I believe itwould be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in away that would disrupt the signal. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no time. <eos> <bos> DATA: During the original incident the Borg presented a genuine dangerto my life. Since the Holodeck safety routine is in place, I know mylife is not in danger. Since I am trying to duplicate the conditions ofthe original incident as closely as possible, I must also attempt toduplicate the jeopardy as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanicsand exobiology. <eos> <bos> DATA: Wesley, was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of earlyprimate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset. <eos> <bos> DATA: Who are you? What do you want? <eos> <bos> DATA: We must be able to use the transporters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Congratulations, Professor, I capitulate to the better man. Yourvictory, sir, is well earned. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. The visor uses a subspace field pulse. I believe thatwhenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantumflux and pushed Worf into another reality. <eos> <bos> DATA: The by-product of an energy source employed by very few speciesbecause of its deleterious effect on living tissue. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not the correct port, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be the remains of a ship. Myanalysis indicates that it was an Antares class freighter. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will change into my uniform, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am glad, sir. It was his dying wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one. <eos> <bos> DATA: Seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us withintransporter range, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believeit would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers. <eos> <bos> DATA: I should not have interfered. It would be best if I apologised. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it is worth an attempt. sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir. I will not look in yourdirection. <eos> <bos> DATA: The purpose of which is? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not by choice. <eos> <bos> DATA: In all likelihood, the explosion damaged the Romulan cloakingdevice, causing it to discharge chroniton particles. I am detecting a chroniton field in here. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed my self diagnostic, and have confirmed that Iwas not aboard the Enterprise for ninety minutes seventeen secondsyesterday afternoon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Attempting to re-route subcommand paths,Captain. Defence systems are protected by access barriers. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is clear that I need guidance to resolve this situation. Counsellor Troi's advice should be useful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the othership's trajectory. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. Perhaps it is scanning us. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity. Itshould be possible to trigger the unit from orbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since your action did not produce the desired results, the onlyadvisable solution should be to re-examine your decision makingprocess, and look for errors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly the formation of a Kerr loop from superstring material. It would require high-energy interactionsoccurring in the vicinity for such a structure to be formed. The riftis certainly not stable, Captain. It could collapse at any time. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: In a way, Doctor. However, there is no physicality. The programmeis continuous but only within the computer's circuitry. <eos> <bos> DATA: Core transfer is engaged. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you were going to go through yourself, sir, that is notpossible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Imagination is not necessary. The scale is readily quantifiable. We are presently generating twelve point seven five billion gigawattsper <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Among humans, a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship, orindicate support, attraction, affection. In this context, I must assume that your intention was to expresssupport. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, they were installed two years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you found the Academy challenging,Wesley? <eos> <bos> DATA: My internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe what happens on the holodeck has a directeffect on the ship. When we attempted to destroy the nodes, thecharacters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us. <eos> <bos> DATA: I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected theradioactive fragments. I was attempting to download the sensor logsfrom the probe's onboard computer. There was a power surge. I believethe surge overloaded my positronic matrix. After that, I have no memoryuntil this moment. It appears I had aninteresting time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir, <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not intend to sit in the chair. <eos> <bos> DATA: Jayden. That is acceptable. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been unable to create a neuralpath around the Borg implants, sir. It is Captain Picard himself whohas somehow managed to initiate contact. <eos> <bos> DATA: To the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a high degree of probability thatthe temporal rift is symmetrical, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am familiar enough with your behaviour patterns to predictcertain decisions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is no prior record of this type of accidentoccurring aboard a starship. Backup systems and safeguards are designedto prevent just such an occurrence. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am on the Enterprise. How did I get here? <eos> <bos> DATA: At the moment, I would find it difficult to choose. <eos> <bos> DATA: The main deflector dish. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was raining in the city by the bay. A hard rain. Hard enoughto wash the slime <eos> <bos> DATA: Put the table over there. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly! The vial was placed in his hand after he died. <eos> <bos> DATA: Clemens? <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you certain you are not saying this because you are mymother? I have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes totheir children's accomplishments. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise, one to beam up. <eos> <bos> DATA: We've lostDATA <eos> <bos> DATA: Well, we figure part of my memory structure wasreplaced with information from the computer's recreational data base. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scout ship has just beamed someone off theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we can accomplish more than that. If there is anothership, and we can reach them, we might be able to coordinate our effortsto free ourselves. <eos> <bos> DATA: Frequency-scan detectors engaged. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am searching for a definition that will allow me to test anhypothesis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hit me. Another please. <eos> <bos> DATA: My condition does not alter with the passage of time, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have beenmapped near thirty nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred yearsalone, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was not painful? <eos> <bos> DATA: It indicates a genetically engineered biological life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: It offers a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans areaccustomed to. However, it would still appear to be the better choice. Do you disagree, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead. LAFORGE <eos> <bos> DATA: Although I do not require sustenance, I occasionally ingestsemi-organic nutrient suspension in a silicon-based liquid medium. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: You have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

There's anantenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south ofour present position. It is emitting low intensity subspace signals. <eos> <bos> DATA: The colony we just planted, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: To solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery. <eos> <bos> DATA: Male, between twenty and thirty years old. <eos> <bos> DATA: A mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is firing on the <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the final manifest has beenreceived. <eos> <bos> DATA: It connected them. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be extremely difficult to maintain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought Iwas on Barkon Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is, of course, a genetic predisposition toward hostilityamong all Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. <eos> <bos> DATA: My father did have an unusual way of looking at things. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may use mine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, but what would be the point? <eos> <bos> DATA: Check her positronic matrix. There may be a cascade anomaly. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. I'm an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are in synchronous orbit above the beamdown site, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The odds favour standing pat. <eos> <bos> DATA: By your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is. However, <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe that is a prudent choice, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: They can lead to wrong conclusions, but they cannot lie. <eos> <bos> DATA: How and when was it repaired? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shearing force ninety two metric tons. Ninety three. Tractor beamis destabilising. Se are going to lose the barge, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Would you care to sit down? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the shuttle is out of control. <eos> <bos> DATA: This will be the last trip, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. However, they have left sensor frequenciesclear. <eos> <bos> DATA: Locking tractor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: But he had destroyed his own reputation by making what seemedwild promises about his positronic brain design, almost all of whichfailed. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I have never done this before. Initiating firstneural link. <eos> <bos> DATA: Projection, sir. We may be able to match hostile's nine pointeight, sir. But at extreme risk. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excellent choice. I'll join you. Computer, two Calaman sherries. Would you care for some dinner as well? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. A homing beacon, sent from Earth. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Using the Potemkin's transport logs from the originalevacuation, Commander La Forge and I were able to modify thetransporters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bedside manner? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, we are nearing the perimeter. One million kilometresaway. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. Will that be sufficient, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Normal spatial relationships are often distorted within thematter stream. Your perceptions may have been exaggerated. <eos> <bos> DATA: I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat theproblems I was having with my systems as challenges to overcome, ratherthan obstacles to be avoided. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ferengi contacts have been detected on both Selay and Antica,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, that will not be necessary. The transporter is notmalfunctioning. I have locked out the controls. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree. What do I do? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a matter of record, Portal. In the Age of Makto, thecentral star of the Tkon Empire destabilised and <eos> <bos> DATA: You asked if I knew my name. I do not. <eos> <bos> DATA: It remains unaffected here as well, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I will leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I must assume your decision is related to the discovery onEarth of <eos> <bos> DATA: Understandable. It has been extinct six hundred thousand of our of our years. Theseplanets were once outposts of that empire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hold position here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our vehicle classification index can put no identity to it. Itsdesign is completely foreign. <eos> <bos> DATA: I bet five. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: What puzzles me, Captain, is how she is expected to bring peaceto Daled Four. Its inhabitants have been fighting throughout theirrecorded history. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, something is dragging us forward. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I can assist you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There's Klingon in the wound. It is saliva. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary ship is heading toward thesecoordinates in the Hyralan Sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found,I discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet. Furtheranalysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate, but Isee no reason to deny it. Proceed. <eos> <bos> DATA: You don't tell me how to behave. You're not my mother. <eos> <bos> DATA: In fact, we are, Commander. However <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am planning a memorial servicefor Commander La Forge and Ensign Ro. I would like you to participate. <eos> <bos> DATA: The movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturallyoccurring phenomenon in the Newtonian sense. They appear to be alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermallayer that has been cast off during moulting. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is nothing to find. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe that statement to be inaccurate, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. Pardon me. I am searching for two individuals with anophidian. A snake. <eos> <bos> DATA: We proceeded to erase all evidence of ourencounter with the Paxans. I reset the computer's chronometer and thecrew was again stunned into unconsciousness, their short-term memorieserased. When they were revived a day later, the computer adjustmentsmade it appear that only thirty seconds had passed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Timothy, accompany me, please. I want youto recall everything you heard people say aboard the Vico before it wasdestroyed. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are no longer synchronous. <eos> <bos> DATA: So far, my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. We have a visual record. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will not be possible to transport, sir. The Tamarian ship hascreated a particle scattering field on the planet's ionosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see your point, Captain, but at the time it seemed the properthing to do. <eos> <bos> DATA: Something wonderful has happened. I can takea deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain. I will never have toface death again. Think of the things I will accomplish over the nextthousand years! What? Oh, I know whatyou're thinking. There is no need to worry. I will create an androidbody for you, too. We can witness the end of time together. Why are youcrying, Kareen? I can love you now. The way I always wanted to. It wasnot right before. I was too old for you, too weak. Now I can beeverything you want me to be. <eos> <bos> DATA: A cold what? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. When you attempted to override the exocomp and send it backinto the tunnel, it responded by deliberately burning out its controlinterface. <eos> <bos> DATA: But if the answer is not forthcoming, your model will notfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mrs Troi? <eos> <bos> DATA: I began with simple conditioned response exercises and followedwith environmental enhancement. Next I plan to explore bioconditioningdevices. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is called a spoon. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is still a fictional character, sir, originally programmedwith nineteenth century knowledge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Delta vee is ninety two metres per second. The mass is too great. We are having an effect but it is negligible. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am curious. What do my nightmares mean? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. But I believe Commander Riker wanted us to letthem escape. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unable to answer that question, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do it! <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe's point of view reveals that theobjects exist entirely in two dimensions, on a single plane. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energy loss increasing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Still no readings, no sign of anything. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Barclay has not yet extended himself into theEngineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an bypassdirectly to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Professor Moriarty, I presume. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without further reinforcement, containmentfield integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Okay. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I have a hypothesis. Thetwenty-second century physicist Pell Underhill conjectured that a majordisruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions ofcounter reactions. That effect may have allowedDoctor Crusher's mosses to arrive at the other side of the worm holewith the unanticipated growth. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at all, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, we are out of range. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am the only one, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your brother was right handed! The alleged suicide note waswritten by a left handed individual such as yourself! <eos> <bos> DATA: I have made visual contact. There are lifeforms here. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we transfer twenty megajoules of energyfrom the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs, it should besufficient to activate the device. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, but the firing programme was dynamic. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that this telepathic communication is creatinginterference in the sleep of other species. That would explain whythe rest of our crew is not dreaming. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating transport sequence now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps I have not made our intentions clear. We areinvestigating <eos> <bos> DATA: You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resistyour wishes. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we field saturate the nacelles, we should be able to sustainwarp speed for approximately two minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. However, we may be able to learn something from theattempt. <eos> <bos> DATA: The emerald tie pin. Presented to Holmes by Queen Victoria afterhe solved the theft of the Bruce-Partington Plans. A copy ofWhitaker's Almanac, which provided Holmes the key to the secret code inThe Valley of Fear. The snuff box of Wilhelm Gottsleig Siegesmann Vander Romstein. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, there are life forms present in that biolab. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is it, Commander. It is programmed toaccept only authorised voice command. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts, sir. Wehave been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will arrive within transporter range in three minutes twentyone seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: The star is in sector two one four five nine. The Rahm Izadsystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, select at random a mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,where I will play Sherlock Holmes and Lieutenant La Forge will beDoctor John Watson. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lead where, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I encountered a minor difficulty, Counsellor,but it has been dealt with. <eos> <bos> DATA: He does. Moriarty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes sir, I believe I have. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was not manual override. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are ready to have you beamed up,Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Are you all right, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Timothy no longer has that kind of support. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would Counsellor Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speakwith Keiko? <eos> <bos> DATA: In much the same way deep sea divers experience nitrogennarcosis, you experienced a form of temporal narcosis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because the cluster is two-dimensional, I do not have enoughdirect evidence to support that assumption. However, it is the mostreasonable hypothesis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually there is a distinct difference between an android and arobot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, continuous playback please. There are approximately onethousand voices overlapping. The voices are those of the Enterprisecrew. Our voices. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there is a vast underground power source which iscontrolled by this console. I believe my triggering of the gateway hascaused a dramatic upsurge in power level. Ah, I have access. <eos> <bos> DATA: Emits charge when lit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Heading three five one mark eleven, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I detect no unusual readings along standard parameters. Curious. The transparent aluminum alloy of this window is exhibiting a patternof transient electrical currents. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There she is, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be an information module. With a holographicinterface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry to disturb you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am running the base drilling programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Based on all information presently available,the decision is correct. This is Lieutenant Commander Data speaking forthe Captain. Abandon ship. This is not a drill. All personnel. This isnot a drill. I say again, abandon ship. Allpersonnel, this is not a drill. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so that the force ofthe explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: When Tyken was trapped in the rift, his analysis determined thata massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly. Fortunately, his cargo included anicium and yurium, which he used todetonate the explosion. He then escaped through the ruptured centre ofthe rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have covered the area in a sphericalpattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the timeallotted. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic. <eos> <bos> DATA: This way, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the refractory metals in the rock strata may alsointerfere with communication. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship matches the Starfleet description of a Lysian destroyer. A short range attack vessel with disruptor style weapons, and astandard crew of fifty three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is death? <eos> <bos> DATA: We can provide you with our analysis of the communicationsbetween the Khitomer outpost and the Romulan ships. However, for acomplete record you will have to contact Starbase twenty four <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: At your service, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are no longer at warp, sir. Impulse power has resumed. Allsystems show normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was unable to prevent it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I have ruled. Please sit down. You may proceed. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of theship. It would be much easier for him to capture and consume one ofthem, than to attempt to break through a door. <eos> <bos> DATA: If she recovers and learns that she is an android <eos> <bos> DATA: Structural reinforcement is at two hundredforty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: So in a sense, they are learning. <eos> <bos> DATA: The factions on Solais Five are historical enemies. So many havedied that both societies are on the verge of extinction. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Hobson! You will carry out my orders or I will relieve youof duty. <eos> <bos> DATA: Verified, sir. Something very small. <eos> <bos> DATA: A justified precaution, Counsellor. Mistress Beata observed thatMister Ramsey and his men are dangerous. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop hasformed in the transfer beam. I will have to go to the substation andattempt to correct the problem from there. <eos> <bos> DATA: They do not seem to be functioning at all, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That analysis is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading a temporal distortion ofmassive proportions. The ophidian is cap time-space continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Politely, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Could you please continue the petty bickering? I find it mostintriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without our shields, at this range there is a high degree ofprobability that a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, it is a personal project. I have reset the sensors to scanfor frequencies outside their usual range. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> DATA: All life on the planet is being destroyed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am adding virtual particle trajectories. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, what he has in mind might provide us with vital information. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shall we begin? <eos> <bos> DATA: The phenomenon is closing in on itself, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Analysis bears out that the object wasdefinitely terrestrial in origin, dated mid twenty first century. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to localise it. It is Cargo bay four. <eos> <bos> DATA: It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninetythree percent of normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I believe it would be prudent to return to theEnterprise. There are physicians on this planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Someone is reading every file, every bit of information stored inthe Enterprise memory banks. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a mystery, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will investigate the options. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twenty five centimetres in length. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel atwarp velocities, there are but two possibilities. Either it is a sensormalfunction, another ship is following us covertly. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Barzans do not have manned space travel, so they had toresort to an automated probe. Its findings are limited. It cannot bedetermined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is, or howlong it will remain intact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aah, ahh, ahh <eos> <bos> DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Onto the Borg ship from here, sir <eos> <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is alsofrom the Lornakclan. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand, sir. Initiating dream programme. Stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to findmeaningful patterns in things that are essentiallyrandom. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggestwhat they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it isclearly a bunny rabbit. <eos> <bos> DATA: I hope you enjoy it. <eos> <bos> DATA: It had a black handle and a serrated blade, and it was quitelong. <eos> <bos> DATA: The drilling process has raised thetemperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degreesCelsius. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us toenter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data is not human! He is <eos> <bos> DATA: The Lantree computer reports access codes received and accepted,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. All of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three. It appears to be a focal point of some kind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then your answer is no. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. My brother's positronic brain has a type L phasediscriminating amplifier. Mine is a type R. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamicprocesses inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas. <eos> <bos> DATA: Distortion wave impact in five seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: So you do purport to be the mythic figure Ardra? <eos> <bos> DATA: These kittens were born less than twenty four hours. It wouldappear that Spot's transformation took place at approximately the sametime. <eos> <bos> DATA: They know everything I know, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Death. <eos> <bos> DATA: It worked well, sir. We have successfullyreseeded the ozone layer. But for their atmosphere to maintain it'sintegrity, they can never use the shield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Electromagnetic and subspace wave frontsapproaching synchronisation. WORF <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps, if we can find the ship which that Commander Worf'squantum signature. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is highly unlikely. Our investigations have clearlydemonstrated <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. She will not remember me, sir, but I will remember her. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe any of these items belong to you, Professor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Activating shield invertors, now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Insufficient information, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The troposphere appears to be distorting our signals. It isfascinating, Captain. Klavdia Three and Daled Four have almostidentical atmospheres. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Clearly you are some kind of intelligent form. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibilitythat I may in some way be the causal factor. However, since you havehad a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of thesickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I detest hypocrisy. I wish they would just come out and admit it! <eos> <bos> DATA: Overlay display with tachyon emissions. Highlight any tachyonsignatures which show subspace inertial displacement. Concentrate asensor sweep in that area. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am awaiting inspiration. <eos> <bos> DATA: The fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms percubic centimetre. As a result, when it passes Moab Four, it will causetectonic shifts well beyond eight point seven on the Richter Scale. <eos> <bos> DATA: Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. You just sit tight. We'll have this all fixed up intime for supper. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mariposa. The Spanish word for butterfly. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a solar flare, Captain. Magnitude twelve, class B. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, establish asecurity code for access to all functions previously transferred toBridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then why did you never attempt to contact me? <eos> <bos> DATA: Nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost. <eos> <bos> DATA: That should suffice. Is there something occupying your thoughts,Jenna? You seem somewhat subdued today. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, positronic. <eos> <bos> DATA: You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be completely accurate. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. But in those situations, you were acting as Head ofSecurity, not as First Officer. The primary role of the second incommand is to carry out the decisions of the Captain in this case, me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Disengage modified beams. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our scientists theorise the Lysians are using an energy wave,either plasma-based or a subspace interference pattern. The weaponseverely disrupts a starship's computer system as well as the mentalfunctions of its crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, sir. On my way. Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We haveencountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six. It is not nativeto this region of space, and there is no previous record of this objecton any Federation charts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of thestomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blotof mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. Why,there's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Humbug, I tell you. Humbug. <eos> <bos> DATA: You have often expressed dissatisfaction with the spartan natureof my quarters. Is this an attempt at embellishment? <eos> <bos> DATA: What is happening, Father? <eos> <bos> DATA: Open a channel. This is Lieutenant Commander Data of theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: No abnormal surges indicated. <eos> <bos> DATA: None so far. I have almost completed this experiment. May Ifinish before we return to Engineering? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is almost as if <eos> <bos> DATA: And if they are not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Even if the molecular level controls have failed, we can stillrecrystallise the dilithium without outside help. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that it will take several days for Captain Picardand me to complete our mission. I would prefer to have a human presentto supervise the birthing process. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why was she laughing? <eos> <bos> DATA: If you wish to apologise, I am prepared to listen. <eos> <bos> DATA: How do you know when something is funny? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. It has been a pleasure. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no reason to accede to Mister Fajo's wishes. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am uncertain, sir. Sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly. <eos> <bos> DATA: The nanites in the upper core are all dead, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinateamount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say Iam preoccupied. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe Guinan does keep a limited supply of non-syntheholicproducts. Perhaps one of them would be to your liking. <eos> <bos> DATA: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> DATA: Tetryon emissions continue to increase. Therupture is still expanding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show it to be an interplanetary vessel, sir. Class seven,crew complement twenty six. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, place a level three containment field around the warpcore. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then our investigation was worthwhile, sir. We have eliminatedboth the delegates and the ship's regular complement. <eos> <bos> DATA: An ancient Earth device used primarily for transportation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fajo. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, scan the shuttle's structuralintegrity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our shields will not withstand another assault. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating gravitational <eos> <bos> DATA: As I have said, with further study it may be possible <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no police record. <eos> <bos> DATA: Priority One. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was forced to kill a Borg. I got angry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. That will never change. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have reached Engineering, Captain. Standing by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Specifications on the vessel, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> DATA: To date we have encountered two thousand eighty five conspicuousexamples of the number three. <eos> <bos> DATA: No question of it, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: One is meant kindly, the other is not. <eos> <bos> DATA: The complex polysaccharides, in reaction with the carbon dioxide,produces an unusual combination of texture andeffervescence. <eos> <bos> DATA: My right to choose. Perhaps my very life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Could you describe feeling hostile? <eos> <bos> DATA: How well did you know Lieutenant Aster? <eos> <bos> DATA: Baryon levels are continuing to rise, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: At our current speed, we will clear the nebula in twelve minutesfour seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where none have gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41263.3. Instead ofreturning to our own galaxy, the Enterprise has gone forwardto a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our presentposition puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy. <eos> <bos> DATA: An accident in Engineering shut down my cognitive functions for ashort period of time, yet I seemed to remain conscious. I saw myfather. <eos> <bos> DATA: One hundred seventy two years, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal has a positronic brain one very similarto my own. I began programming it at the cybernetics conference. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a holodeck audience. They were programmed to laugh ateverything. Perhaps I should reprogram the audience to display a moreaccurate response. <eos> <bos> DATA: The wave has increased speed to warp seven point two, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly they were simply curious. Explorers like ourselves. <eos> <bos> DATA: I too. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it would. During the last hour, I have conducted asystematic review of the entire Romulan subspace grid. I have comparedmy findings with the specifications of your own transmission array. They appear to be compatible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are coming back online. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I thank you for your sympathy, but she is here. Her presence soenriched my life that I could not allow her to pass into oblivion. So Iincorporated her programs back into my own. I have transferred hermemories to me. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return toyour planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: I implore you, do not reactivate him. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unfamiliar with the gentleman's name. I have spoken toseveral people at that office. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please explain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then the proper course of action would be to release hydrogeninto the rift, and hope that they have a substance that will detonateit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cowardice is a term that I have never heard applied to Tasha. <eos> <bos> DATA: The life form's patterns are stable, Captain. It seems able to withstand the solar radiation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, subspace radio is out. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the perpetrator reprogrammed the memory chips to eraseany record. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The comet's outer shell is composed primarily ofgaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner coreconsists of heavier elements <eos> <bos> DATA: Extensive. The Captain's first diplomatic contact dates back to <eos> <bos> DATA: I have just started the scan. Did you not go to Sickbay? <eos> <bos> DATA: Then a name, or a place. It could besomething personal. In this case, in binary language, which is ones andzeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters. <eos> <bos> DATA: She claims to, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Emergency signal reads as follows. Enterprise to divert tocoordinates four-two-three by one one two by five one immediately. Further orders forthcoming. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Unless they have all died. Their ship could have been brought inby automation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Distortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds. Hull stressis nearing maximum tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please come to Engineering immediately. It is urgent. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Watson. Not a dead end at all. Hello, what's this? Can yousee the scratches? <eos> <bos> DATA: I was found twenty metres in that direction, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have the same safeguards as the ship's computer. Therefore, Imust report any inquiry regarding restricted information to theCaptain. Your reaction suggests you do not wish the Captain to beinformed of your inquiry. <eos> <bos> DATA: The test ship is maintaining at warp two point three five, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Has Spot been misbehaving? <eos> <bos> DATA: And apparently, the Captain destroyed the ship without notice orprovocation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation. I have clearly determinedPardek's routine. On days when the Senate is not in session, heinvariably comes to this section after the median hour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I must ask you to stop using the exocomps. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not accepting your commands. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Are you my enemy? <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed? But surely, sir <eos> <bos> DATA: I've never seen anyone eat ten chocolate sundaes. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: In orbit of Quadra Sigma Three, sir. Ready to beam downrescue team to underground emergency area. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not want you to check my systems. I must resolve theseissues myself. <eos> <bos> DATA: The creature's anatomy appears most peculiar. <eos> <bos> DATA: The surface settlement appears to be all butdestroyed. Sensors show that the colonists now live in structures thatextend nearly three kilometres beneath the city. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inthe game of military brinksmanship, individual physicalprowess is less important than the perception ofa species as a whole. For over nine millennia, potential foes haveregarded the Zakdorns as having the greatest innately strategic mindsin the galaxy. <eos> <bos> DATA: One moment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I do. <eos> <bos> DATA: They have discontinued their association. She has made the firstmove in initiating a relationship with me. What should I do? <eos> <bos> DATA: I can do it, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pardon me? <eos> <bos> DATA: No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, this will take slightly more time than we have, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: A level-four diagnostic of the foodreplication systems has failed to detect any faults in the orientationterminals. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ambient light in this location accentuates its contours. However, a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aestheticcriteria. A more central location will carry added meaning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, identify exit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Speed increasing, sir. Warp seven point six,seven point six five. Warp seven point seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reversing tractor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we can isolate something unique to the Odin survivors, perhapsan element not otherwise found on Angel One, we can utilise theEnterprise scanners. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am incapable of anger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shall I set course for Darwin Station? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sure that will not be necessary, Captain. I am fully capableof running a circuit check on myself. It will immediately determine anyabnormalities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Main power is offline. All systems are instandby or emergency mode. There is no response from any mannedstation. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can control the rate of my follicle replenishment. However, Ihave not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair. Why do youask? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, what is the time, please? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people. The onlytwo people who were with Commander La Forge all three times atransmission was recorded. Captain Picard and Ambassador Kell. One ofthem may be concealing an E-band transmitter. If they would agree to besearched <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. E-band emissions are difficult to localise. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is fortunate that I am able to perform my duties withoutemotional distractions. If that were not the case, a sudden coursecorrection toward the Neutral Zone would make me very nervous. <eos> <bos> DATA: Disabling the detection system so her forces could attack. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then perhaps we should begin our meal. Among humans, a low serumglucose level is often responsible for <eos> <bos> DATA: We have received a subspace communiqué from StarfleetCommand regarding the young human, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I will teach you to recognise the artistry in paintings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you lock on to the exocomps? <eos> <bos> DATA: Verbal composition at it's most sophisticated level. Yourchild-like mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of my words. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, identify please. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destructionin a manner that would have an emotional effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassiandefensive systems. Their ship is running with a high powered subspacefield. <eos> <bos> DATA: Very good, Commander. You have established a connection. I cannow raise the door. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will go to deck twenty and begin modifications. <eos> <bos> DATA: The door sensor is programmed to recognise only humanoid formsforentry and egress. Spot could not have triggered the mechanism. <eos> <bos> DATA: One seven three four six seven three two one four seven sixCharlie three two seven eight nine seven seven seven six four threeTango seven three two Victor seven three one one seven eight eighteight seven three two four seven six seven eight nine seven six fourthree seven six. Lock. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have returned to normal space. Navigational systems are stilloffline. I will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondarysystems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps if I looked for a suitable place to display it? <eos> <bos> DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf. Your clothing identifies youwith the character of Will Scarlett, just as Geordi's mandolinidentifies him as Alan A-Dale <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. The bets will indicate of the relative strength ofeach hand. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Black Cluster was formed almost ninebillion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in closeproximity. The resulting gravitational forces are both violent andhighly unpredictable. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand, sir. If you feel the risk is too great tosend Tam Elbrun alone, then send me with him. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nurse Ogawa has recently became pregnant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Or when one of them hits us. My readings suggest that thedeformations themselves are in motion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was not my intention to deceive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your restraint was most remarkable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Animated presentation, humanoid. Interaction required. <eos> <bos> DATA: We were seeking raw materials for our replicating process. <eos> <bos> DATA: Was this your intention from the beginning? <eos> <bos> DATA: Tactical station. Where Lieutenant Worf is now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. It is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationshipinvolved. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ira never told you how beautiful you were to him. He never toldyou that, did he? He could not tell you, do you understand? <eos> <bos> DATA: At their current speed, sir, the entities will intercept us inten minutes, thirty one seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded inthis wall. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which you destroyed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Class M readings from the fifth planet in the system. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a matter of perspective, Doctor. In the strictest sense, Idid not win. + <eos> <bos> DATA: Throughout the ages, from Keats to Jorkemo, poets have composedodes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives. Inkeeping with that tradition, I have written my next poem in honour ofmy cat. I call it Ode to Spot. Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature. Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses Contribute to your hunting skill and natural defences. I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations. A singular development of cat communications That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection, For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection. A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents. You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance. And when not being utilised to aid in locomotion It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which would require extreme precision from the probe controls. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Please access all Starfleet Command orders to starships, starbases andcolonies for the past six months. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I created her, using myself as a model. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, Starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to OceanusFour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then why are you annoyed? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the entity was caught in the ship's circuitry. The Captainmight try to get in the same way if he's in trouble. <eos> <bos> DATA: The arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support,penetrating my secondary subprocessor. Fortunately, none of mybiofunctions seem affected. Do not be concerned, Counsellor. I believeyour aim is improving. <eos> <bos> DATA: Too much to explain. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you are correct, Counsellor, I believe they have already toldus what to do and are waiting for us to do it. When we are ready, theonly message you should attempt to convey is, now. <eos> <bos> DATA: The access would be available by code orpassword. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is impossible, sir. The ship you are onhas violated a Federation outpost. It is my duty to stop it. <eos> <bos> DATA: These permutations are going to take a very long time. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. I must object to that plan. <eos> <bos> DATA: He will be unsuccessful, and will store the shape in his memorybanks. It will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: Three, sir. All gathered inside what appears to be the entranceto a mining tunnel. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have found a quicker way out of here, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be happy to be of help. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you know anything about it? <eos> <bos> DATA: What have you learned about the tectonic stability around thedrilling sites? <eos> <bos> DATA: We can enhance them through the imageprocessor in the ship's computer. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will have to be, sir. The next transport window will not occurfor another eight years, when the planet's orbit will bring it closeenough to the sun to de-phase the distortion field. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, what is the definition of life? <eos> <bos> DATA: If we narrow the search parameters to the biological database, itmight increase the chances of the computer finding a match. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, number four shield has failed. Increasing power to number three shield to compensate. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: The asteroid's gravity is drawing us closer. Velocity isincreasing. Velocity still increasing. Now at two hundred and nineteenmetres per second. Starboard aft thruster. You have used the asteroid'sgravitational pull as a slingshot. Excellent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Time to impact approximately sixty seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would not be in favour of that, sir. There are many things thatshe can learn only from me. My lifetime of experiences. The mistakes Ihave made and what I have learned from them. <eos> <bos> DATA: No change in position. <eos> <bos> DATA: To grow old together? That is an integral component of marriage? <eos> <bos> DATA: I find myself in complete agreement with that assessment of thesituation, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to theanomalous construction of the Ferengi brain, which is composed of fourdifferent <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, do you believe Ardra is, to use the vernacular, a conartist? <eos> <bos> DATA: Inertial guidance shows one point four parsecs travelled,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sickbay? Are you ill, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Attitude control has been restored. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: In seventeen hours their hull degradation will reach dangerouslevels. They will have to leave before that. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individualsand locations. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I help? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now running it throughlanguage and logic circuits. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, Lieutenant. You seem to have lost the will tocommunicate with others. You have friends here. We, we care about you. Why, just recently, Geordi, Wesley and I were saying <eos> <bos> DATA: Tam? <eos> <bos> DATA: Seventeen, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You tend to underestimate humans, my brother. Praising youngWesley on the helm, for exampleLORE <eos> <bos> DATA: Direct hit. Engineering Section and deck forty two. Shieldgenerators are overloading. <eos> <bos> DATA: These incidents are common to cat owners. When you borrowed Spot,you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviourbefore getting a cat yourself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes and no. Like a time displacement, but it does not have adiscernible event horizon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can bedetrimental. <eos> <bos> DATA: I look forward to the time we spend together. <eos> <bos> DATA: Where is your automobile now? <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a probe of some kind, but there is no Starfleetrecord of this shape or design. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, but I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, display the transport logs for thesequence just completed. Computer, what is beingdisplayed here? <eos> <bos> DATA: We did find that Wesley opened his coolant interlock just beforebeginning the manoeuvre around Titan. <eos> <bos> DATA: They may merely have poorly developed language skills. <eos> <bos> DATA: As he bypasses each subsystem, I can re-route it without hisknowledge. <eos> <bos> DATA: The streak they refer to will eventually reach fifty six games. And be snapped by a pair of journeyman hurlers for the ClevelandIndians. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, he was pleased to have won a championship emblem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eight, Ace, Queen. The dealer receives a four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not a thing. <eos> <bos> DATA: If there are indicators as to why this particular area hasremained intact, I cannot detect them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. In each of the three instances wecame into contact with one of the temporal fragments, we wereintegrated into its time frame. <eos> <bos> DATA: South America. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pulaski, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. You have exceeded my abilities. I do not object, but I do notunderstand how this hasoccurred. <eos> <bos> DATA: What type of journey? <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I am detecting life signs from behind that door. <eos> <bos> DATA: Will two hours be enough time to complete the high-resolutionseries on the neutron star? <eos> <bos> DATA: Recheck analysis, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is more, sir. I have taken the liberty of expanding theparameters of my search, and have discovered that Pardek hasseveral relatives in the Krocton segment. I believe you will be able tolocate him there on the third day of the Romulan week when the Senateis not in session. <eos> <bos> DATA: Anti-time, sir? PICARD <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe his basic research lacks the specificsnecessary to support an experiment of this magnitude. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: A sensing device from the escape pod. It monitors the bioelectricsignatures of the crew, in the event they get separated from the pod. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unlikely as it may sound, I believe that the Enterprise may beforming an intelligence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving Starfleet orders granting a Lwaxana <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true, Doctor, but what would you want me to say? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will be back for him later. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am a personal friend. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transversesupports. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is the one worthy opponent created by the author, Conan Doyle. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nor do I. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me? <eos> <bos> DATA: The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three fiveseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I must point out that the Ventaxians did have one thousandyears of peace and tranquility as promised by Ardra. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore also told me the colonists petitioned you to replace himwith a less perfect android. <eos> <bos> DATA: But Counsellor, I do not have an ego. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dying from what, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs to Fajo. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not necessarily. Commander Riker may be bluffing, Wesley. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently so, sir. My neural nets are still fully operational. You may begin by opening the ventral access panel located twocentimetres beneath my right ear. <eos> <bos> DATA: But they lack the ability to use it properly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starboard thruster firing. <eos> <bos> DATA: You appeared to need it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal wouldbe permanently lost. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course, but <eos> <bos> DATA: An excellent steed, sir. Sorry to disturb you, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: If they were cloaked in some way. <eos> <bos> DATA: Possibly a great number of people, Commander. The interiorsurface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than twohundred and fifty million class M planets. <eos> <bos> DATA: The only Class M planets in the system are Pentarus two and five,both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that the purpose of existence? To care for someone? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do youwish me to deactivate Lal? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading significant power fluctuations from the stationcore. Please report. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twelve seconds to impact, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engines disengaged. We are now entering therift. Hull stress is increasing. Eighty three percent ofmaximum tolerance and rising. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there appear to be three of us. 1 <eos> <bos> DATA: A most interesting occupation. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so. The message reads, my revenge is athand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I to understand that Garvin's illness has spread? <eos> <bos> DATA: His queries to me primarily focused on Doctor Soong's <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That beats my fours. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a system of roads on this planet, which indicates ahighly industrialised civilisation. But where there should be citiesthere are only great rips in the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: No sign of a wound. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, when the Fleming activated their warp drive, the riftexpanded by two point three percent. We no longer have sufficientmomentum to escape. <eos> <bos> DATA: During the last occurrence, I was able toconfirm one of my hypotheses. The unusual preponderance of dark matterin this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space. Asthe Enterprise moves through this nebula, it is colliding with thesedeformations. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ninety seven minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, an energy field is forming around the device. Intensityis three point two terawatts and increasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: But Commander Riker and Lieutenant Riker are. Yet they seem tohave trouble getting along with each another. I have found that humansvalue their uniqueness, that sense that they are different from everyone else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Couldthat be the source of the friction? <eos> <bos> DATA: The control mechanism's not operative, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a virtual impossibility, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet reports <eos> <bos> DATA: She does not feel the emotion of loneliness, but she can observehow isolated she is from the others. She wishes to be more like them. Ido not know how to help her. Lal is passing into sentience. It isperhaps the most difficult stage of her development. <eos> <bos> DATA: And a trail, which is so well marked, that obviously we are meantto follow it. <eos> <bos> DATA: The matter-antimatter injectors locked for a split second. I amnot certain why, sir. They appear to be working properly now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. On my way. <eos> <bos> DATA: The force of that explosion would destroy this cavern andeveryone on the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: The interlink sequencer is now bi-directional. It compensates forthe asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is very important for me to know that, sir. I never dreamed itwas possible I might find some link with some form like my own. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since both planets are gas giants, neitherpossesses a solid surface. Their atmospheres, however, will come intocontact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. In her case, the has created an amphibiouslifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sever modified beams. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scan the drive section for life form readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: One Samarian Sunset, made in the traditional style. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is Nuria the one in motion? <eos> <bos> DATA: They employ a subspace proximity detonator. A normal tricorderwould never detect it. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan thissystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: To avoid deceiving oneself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Counsellor. I believe I will initiate a dreamprogramme now. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I may, sir. One of the things about them in the briefingstudies was their respect for patience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pardon me, sir. I am experiencing subspace interference whichlimits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as <eos> <bos> DATA: I have isolated three segments of thisrecording that are crucial. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it upto be human. <eos> <bos> DATA: A rare anomaly named after Bela Tyken, the Melthusian captain whofirst encountered it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm reading something off the starboard bow, but there is nothingthere. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a steam locomotive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Separate from it's control console. <eos> <bos> DATA: Chancellor. Minister. <eos> <bos> DATA: About that, sir. Did the Doctor believe I was boasting? <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have compensated. Still no readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid they would require the molecular structure of thebeverage in question. And, as you are no doubt aware, our knowledge ofyour planet is quite limited. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you for allowing me to participate. It was remarkable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the pod's life support system is failing. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are obviously still aboard. Another Starfleet vessel must besent to intercept the Enterprise at Bynaus. They might be taking theship to their home planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: The rupture has expanded another four point two percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approximately two hundred thousand years, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities? <eos> <bos> DATA: With the application of a little care, Wes, the paper can beutilised again. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. The bodies were found in the rubble after the stormhad passed. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a reasonable assumption. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from theplanet, sir, but I cannot pinpoint the location yet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. The number of new circuit pathways has increased bysix hundred thirty two percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: These are not ordinary nanites. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is visible, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The phaser pulse appears to have been carefullyattenuated for just that effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: You wanted to see me? <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I so different from you, Doctor? Are you able to ceasethinking on command? <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you here to find a wedding gift? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Captain's log, stardate 45350.3. We have arrived atPenthara Four and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastationcaused by the asteroid impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: One hour, seventeen minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a passenger liner which mostly travelled Earth's AtlanticOcean during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. Itappears to extend to the cellular level. <eos> <bos> DATA: In the early twenty-second century, Earth was recovering fromWorld War Three. A major philosopher of the period was Liam Dieghan,founder of the Neo-Transcendentalists, who advocated a return to asimpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature, and learnedunder her gentle tutelage <eos> <bos> DATA: It was Starfleet officers who rescued me. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears it be a Cardassian supply ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: The ship's computer would have corrected immediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is best that I do not remember. I trust I did nothingunbecoming to a Starfleet officer? <eos> <bos> DATA: The anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulsesin the other two time periods. I suggest shutting them down. <eos> <bos> DATA: I could have you confined to quarters for the duration of themission. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And more, perhaps. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights andstatus. Am I a person or property? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not wish to be assimilated. <eos> <bos> DATA: City block. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir, and the resulting explosion wouldlikely destroy the saucer section in the process. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, exit! <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at all, Counsellor. You surreptitiously placed the edge ofyour left thumb against the card. When you divided the deck toreshuffle, you kept that card on top. You thus were able to have meeither save or discard, depending on the location of the card, whichyou followed at each step until we were left with just one. The card Ioriginally chose. Sir, I believe under the circumstances <eos> <bos> DATA: The thanks actually go to Doctor Clendenning on Omicron Theta whodid the first experiments with gamma scans. <eos> <bos> DATA: We could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchangefor information. <eos> <bos> DATA: Half-Betazoid. Her father was human. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ambassador, you may find this of interest. These newly refinedsensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloakedwarbird even at warp. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fortunately we are only two days from Starbase four one six, andtheir laboratory can isolate <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields buckling, Captain. They will not <eos> <bos> DATA: It will cost you twenty to make that determination, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are correct in that I have no frame of reference to confirmmy hypothesis. In fact, I am unable to provide a verbal description ofthe experience. Perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry. Icould then use that as a reference. <eos> <bos> DATA: Five kilometres, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inquiry. Private eye? <eos> <bos> DATA: You were a colleague of Doctor Soong? <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot locate the Enterprise anywherewithin one light year of the planet, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos> <bos> DATA: One kilometre forty six metres. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a programming malfunction. Thecomputer refuses to identify the exits. <eos> <bos> DATA: These are the elements we have available. Some of them could beused in the creation of an explosive reaction. If we could communicatethis inventory to the other ship, perhaps they would be able to <eos> <bos> DATA: Stable. But we have maintained warp factor nine for longer thanis recommended, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet records contain no mention of the Duras sisters aftertheir departure from Deep Space Nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe sends information via a focused particle beam. Itshould be able to cut through the interference. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid soquickly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without further analysis of your condition from Counsellor Troior Doctor Crusher, I cannot say. But I believe it is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are disobeying the Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is well patched, sir. Closed indicates a permanent condition,which I cannot guarantee. <eos> <bos> DATA: For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the maskwas exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quitenaturally. <eos> <bos> DATA: I appear to be reversing that defeat. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, drop the shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am picking up a small metallic object, approximatelythree point five metres in diameter. <eos> <bos> DATA: The records of the Stargazer, sir. What the Ferengi call theBattle of Maxia. It seems the Captain's personal log contains a muchdifferent version of that conflict than the official historic account. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you suggesting that there is some value in losing? <eos> <bos> DATA: Puzzling. How can anything be too efficient? <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps there is nothing to read. Nothing more than mechanismsand algorithmic responses. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf, if the situation is under control, pleasereport to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we just had one minute more, sir, <eos> <bos> DATA: How could you, Doctor? He has not said anything. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, density appears to be lower off the starboard bow. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, there is evidence of residualbitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the Entity'sattack. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency. Perhaps we should examine the phase buffers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increase the sensor field bandwidth. Patch in the lateral sensorarrays. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is conceivable that he was viewing a synthetically generatedimage, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the procedure is successful, your cognitive processingfunctions will be considerably improved. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe he means television, sir. That particular form ofentertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty. <eos> <bos> DATA: I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify herassertions. <eos> <bos> DATA: What level of communication, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: We will try to honour him in the manner in which he specified,will we not, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not like it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Holding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will arrive in fifty one hours, thirty two minutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: One is an infant. Another is elderly. Two are middle aged. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not your puppet anymore. <eos> <bos> DATA: Accessing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, our options are very limited. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Moseley's computers can accomplish the same task, sir. butGeordi would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances. <eos> <bos> DATA: In solitude, there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, reading another open access panel. <eos> <bos> DATA: And I will perform a self-diagnostic. <eos> <bos> DATA: By all means, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> DATA: No sir. We were unable to track it once it left the cargo bay. <eos> <bos> DATA: Faith? Then you do believe Kahless may have supernaturalattributes? As an android, I am unable to acceptthat which cannot be proven through rational means. I would appreciatehearing your insights on this matter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. However, theoretically, <eos> <bos> DATA: It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure andweakened the barriers between quantum realities. If he re-enters thefissure in his original shuttle, and emits a broad spectrum warp field,it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities fromemerging into our own. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I have successfully learned to dance? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not think it would be wise to startle her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do know who I am. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are much more than that, Jenna. I have written a subroutinespecifically for you. Aprogramme within the programme. I have devoted a considerable share of my internal resources to itsdevelopment. <eos> <bos> DATA: All systems seem functional, Captain. Everything is in perfectorder. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have encountered one thousand, seven hundred fifty fournon-human races during my tenure with Starfleet. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am having difficulty scanning the object. It appears to beapproximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct, sir. Their impulse system is down as well, Powergeneration is at extremely low levels. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are out of order. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inconclusive, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands,where the pheromones are produced. I believe I can activate thepheromones with a bioactivant solution. <eos> <bos> DATA: Rate exceeding critical level. Core densityis becoming unstable. <eos> <bos> DATA: You did, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crewwhom Spot seems to like. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warship is three hundred thousand kilometres from thePhoenix. It is opening fire. The Phoenix has taken a directhit. The Phoenix is beginning evasive manoeuvres. It has positioneditself outside the weapons range of the opposing ship. The Phoenix has powered up both phasers and photon torpedoes. ThePhoenix is firing photon torpedoes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nearly impossible, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beam appears to contain holographic imaging information. <eos> <bos> DATA: Carlos. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: We should programme the bridge sciencestation to vary the emissions we direct toward the Entity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I will have to follow the rules of conduct for a Ventaxianjurist. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is another possibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approaching the source, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, execute complete shutdown of theHolodeck. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is the difference between knowledge and experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Basic early design. Capable of sub-light travel only. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, that is true. But I never wanted to compound oneillusion with another. It might be real to Q, perhaps even you, sir. But it would not be so to me. Was it not one of the Captain's favouriteauthors who wrote, This above all, to thine own self be true? Sorry,Commander, I must decline. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to recreate the experience which caused to myinitial burst of anger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering. Is Engineering your destinationas well? <eos> <bos> DATA: How did the Conductor stop the train? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. <eos> <bos> DATA: Interesting. Perhaps I could modify your sister's techniques tokeep Spot from jumping on console. Do you know how she was able totrain her cat? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, will I be able to schedule a performance for the crew in thenear future? <eos> <bos> DATA: I was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth,that you really are human. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Garvin, with your permission, I would like to begin my owninvestigation regarding the cause of your illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: Right one metre. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would you be willing to share your information with us? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, begin random fluctuation of shield frequency andmodulation. <eos> <bos> DATA: From the molecular configuration, it appears The aperture is beginning to fluctuate. I believe <eos> <bos> DATA: This would not appear to be routine. I was able to trace thesource of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulanintelligence. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ambassador Spock, may I ask a personal question? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Klingon. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear that Spot has had her kittens. <eos> <bos> DATA: Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulatingit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. <eos> <bos> DATA: You said in the transporter room that you could not read my mind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vesselpoint one two light years from our location. <eos> <bos> DATA: Without external influence. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest. However, Ican analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparativeconclusions about its possible effect on the human palate. But Ineither like it nor dislike it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. According to my tricorder, the holodeck safeties havebeen disengaged. His weapon could be lethal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am taking the warp-coil engines offline. <eos> <bos> DATA: It's a trick. He is trying to divide us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gia, I think we should leave. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. Their phaser banks are not armed. <eos> <bos> DATA: And you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Slang, sir. I did use it correctly, did I not? <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the cause of the accident may be related to theexplosion on the Romulan ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sure he meant now. So, you need time to get into uniform. <eos> <bos> DATA: Will this be enough? <eos> <bos> DATA: The refractory metal in the rock formations may act as aneffective barrier. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant D'Sora just gave me what could be considered a verypassionate kiss in the torpedo bay. <eos> <bos> DATA: The star has entered a period of increased activity. Sensorsindicate that the solar flares will continue to grow. In three hours,our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are many opinions. On Galvin Five, a marriage is consideredsuccessful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding. Andorian marriages require groups of four people unless <eos> <bos> DATA: They range from two to three metres inheight. Silver grey in colour. They have four limbs. No eyes or earsare noticeable. There is a single orifice where a humanoid foreheadwould ordinarily be. They are reclined against therock face surrounding an apparatus of some sort approximately one pointfive metres in height. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have a hypothesis that may explain that, Captain. I haveanalysed the recording Doctor Crusher made. Most of it is quiteordinary. One hundred fifty discussions about ship operations, twohundred fifty two conversations of a personal nature, five couplesengaged in romantic encounters. <eos> <bos> DATA: What's wrong with you? <eos> <bos> DATA: To create this radiation field would take several hundredthousand, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: But, Captain, will they not protest? <eos> <bos> DATA: Admiral Hanson on subspace, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am assisting Commander La Forge with a very complexcalculation. It demands a great deal of my concentration. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation. <eos> <bos> DATA: The laser blasts seemed to end when theyelling stopped. <eos> <bos> DATA: If Endar respects Talarian custom, he may have to. According totheir tradition, a male child of fourteen has reached the age ofdecision. He then undergoes a ceremony of initiation, after which hehas the freedom to make his own choices. <eos> <bos> DATA: Construction records show this to be almost identical to thatwhich Starfleet uses. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bearing two seven one mark four, sir. She is headed into thesun's corona. <eos> <bos> DATA: But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you. <eos> <bos> DATA: At the rate the radiation levels areincreasing, the hyronalin additive will only be effective for anotherthirty eight minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unable to transfer control, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Robots small enough to enter living cells. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is certainly not consistent with his android persona. <eos> <bos> DATA: Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they weremarried there. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Careful, Captain. The stun effect from the wormhole wasrelatively severe. <eos> <bos> DATA: Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two,prepare for docking. Level one precautions remain in effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Confirmed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are entering the Lysian system, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the warp engines fail to function, the result could beunfortunate. <eos> <bos> DATA: The window is allowing intermittent sensor readings. There arestill numerous ghost images, but I believe we are picking up two lifeforms near the beacon. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible, sir. But absolutely no margin for error. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tell them tostop, or I kill everyone in this room, starting with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: That will not be necessary, Doctor. He is gone. <eos> <bos> DATA: This game is exceedingly simple. With only fifty two cards,twenty one of which I will see, and four other players, there are alimited number of winning combinations. <eos> <bos> DATA: My positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect mefrom power surges. It would be possible for you to remove my cranialunit and take it with you. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were in a space module. <eos> <bos> DATA: I bet ten. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, you will find a small alien ship off the starboardbow. Please secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is no larger than the holodeck, of course, so the computeradjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeckwalls <eos> <bos> DATA: Scattering field is down, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is true, Doctor. The contents of their logs and journals weretransferred into my memory cells. The man who created me alsoexperimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists'temporal lobes and programming them into my neural nets. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears that your hypothesis was correct, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: You would not consider it to be an honour? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am apparently guilty of falsifying the Enterprise's records, ofinterfering with an investigation, of disobeying adirect order from my commanding officer. Your duty seems clear, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumardisappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am accessing. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is exactly how it appeared. There was a mind working againstme. <eos> <bos> DATA: A standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would explain the mysterious chroniton fields RO <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise, two to beam up. You must come with me. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is something of an understatement. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shields are down, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Empirical study. Monitor the subject. <eos> <bos> DATA: Forty seven, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanning. Vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown. I am attempting to analyse motion pattern. Results stillinconclusive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: But those qualities would interfere with rational judgment, wouldthey not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Except that we are still in it, sir. Captain, if we dropped astationary beacon and travelled straight away from it, we would have afixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask how you got here? 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimattercontainment. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. There were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then here you die. <eos> <bos> DATA: It adjusted to my tactics. It tracked with me, anticipating. Afixed programmecould not have done that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I must hurry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have the readout on Dytallix B, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I am capable of performing significant tasks both mental andphysical. Perhaps your hotel would offer me a job. <eos> <bos> DATA: As a Starfleet officer, I am required to follow all of yourorders, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The bird did not appear in my original experience. This vision isdifferent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, I wish to know more about humour. Why certain combinations of words and actions make humans laugh. <eos> <bos> DATA: Methinks I could not die anyplace so contented as in the King'scompany, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, like your sister. <eos> <bos> DATA: Another three hours twenty two minutes, sir. I can override it ifnecessary. <eos> <bos> DATA: My internal chronometer was supposed to wake me thirty fiveminutes ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Doctor, but they do have superior experience. During theirservice, they have interfaced with every part of the station core,something none of us has done, including yourself. They may haveanother way to control the particle surge. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no guarantee that Wesley will be reassigned to theEnterprise. Ninety one per cent of Starfleet graduates are not postedto Galaxy class starships on their first assignment. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is an excellent idea. I will wait for them in there. <eos> <bos> DATA: A phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the metaphasicprojection matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Absolutely. <eos> <bos> DATA: It depicts something that feels familiar, sir. And dangerous. ButI have no idea what it represents. And that is all. Except for animpression of this being a Doctor Soong's work area. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tracking torpedoes. Entry programme confirmed. <eos> <bos> DATA: In a way, it would have been like committing suicide. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have not yet identified the substance, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I wish to submit myself for disciplinary action. I havedisobeyed a direct order from a superior officer. Althoughthe result of my actions proved positive, the ends cannot justify themeans. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the planet's troposphere is distorting our signal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was not sent by your father. Our ship encountered a species whoappears to be threatening nineteenth century Earth. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are through the perimeter, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That fact is not in dispute. However, you may have acted withundue haste and in doing so, unintentionally hurt Chief O'Brien'sfeelings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds tocritical. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised. <eos> <bos> DATA: And at this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids acollision with the first. <eos> <bos> DATA: That cannot be possible. I have a memory record for that periodof time. I can recall a series of images. I saw Doctor Soong. Myfather. <eos> <bos> DATA: Source? <eos> <bos> DATA: We can reconfigure the primary sensor array. If we narrow theirfocus to scan for E-band emissions, we might be able to calculate adirectional vector. But only if there are more occurrences. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will prepare the power transfer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, a human proverb! As in folklore, or an historical allusion,or tribal memories <eos> <bos> DATA: If the exocomps do not shut down after I have programmed them, wemay assume they are willing to go. <eos> <bos> DATA: True, but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technologyintroduced at the conference which I discovered could be used to laydown complex neural net pathways. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Sarjenka's transmission could be viewed as a call for help. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why am I lying on the floor in this undignified position with thefour of you standing over me, displaying expressions of concern? <eos> <bos> DATA: You may find it aesthetically displeasing, sir. I could just filea computer report on that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below theplanet's surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent. Hisbrain is much smaller, sir. I do not believe he can comprehend ourlanguage. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am getting energy readings. Look out! <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps it is you, Geordi. Includling the kiddillies, I'velearned six hundred sixty two jokes, and you have not <eos> <bos> DATA: Welcome back, Captain. We were not expecting to see you on theBridge so soon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Injectors open. There is no engine activity at all, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The people of Kaelon Two are isolationists, almost to the pointof being xenophobes. Regrettably, we know very little about theircustoms. <eos> <bos> DATA: A human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as acarrier for ownone, thus disguising its origin. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: I plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief periodeach day. I hope to generate new internal visions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The core breach has been prevented, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Tough? As in difficult? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, may I make a personal inquiry? It concerns my poetryreading. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Captain and many of the crew are not yet convinced he istruly human. <eos> <bos> DATA: After relieving Lieutenant La Forge, Icomputed the length of time the border outpost <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: All critical subcommands are protected,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why would the Captain not want to review allavailable information on the subject? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in Spot. Althoughshe does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer consolewhen I am working. <eos> <bos> DATA: Request complete text of all stories involving said character. Increase speed. Captain's log, supplemental. The Jaradan rendezvousstill is eleven hours away. I am about to reenter the worldof Dixon Hill, this time properly dressed. An experience like this ismore enjoyable when shared, so I've invited our fiction expert, Whalen,to accompany me. Doctor Crusher will join us shortly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are receiving a signal from dead ahead. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, an unscheduled launch is taking place in Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I saw you working the with your left hand. Commander LaForge is right handed, sir. A similar malfunction occurred in theSherlock Holmes programme I was running before Moriarty first appeared. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was Lieutenant Barclay who first suggested a link between thetwo incidents. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Data to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: We should also consider the advantages of further examination ofthe Borg and their vessel, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tasha exists in our memories as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am picking up no vessels, no additional sentry pods. <eos> <bos> DATA: Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have been unable to detect a signal from her communicator. Either it has been deactivated or she is being held in a shieldedlocation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander? <eos> <bos> DATA: Because you are different. Differences sometimes scare people. Ihave learned that some of them use humour to hide their fear. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on severaloccasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run afull analysis on the kittens once they <eos> <bos> DATA: It may be difficult, sir. I am detecting a significant number ofstrands behind us. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is indeed laid out as a vessel with what appear to becorridors and chambers. An internal environment suitable for carbonbased life forms is being maintained, yet there is no evidence of acrew aboard. Tin Man is a living being which has been bred or hasadapted itself to serve a purpose. I find that interesting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Those phenomena are relatively common. We would need to identifyat least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path. <eos> <bos> DATA: All systems operating. <eos> <bos> DATA: A fighter? <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you require assistance? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, I'm aware of your interest in her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I have modified the Method for my own uses. Since I have noemotional awareness to create a performance, I am attempting to useperformance to create emotional awareness. I believe if I can learn toduplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, I will be one step closer totruly understanding humanity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, situation analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: The good Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm almost finished, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am showing no transporter activity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The pattern has no exact match in Federation records, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Barnum, sir. PT. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryonparticles. We believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspacemanifold. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with thefact that my father never mentioned her to me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, restore holographic image. <eos> <bos> DATA: Triolic waves. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Wellington is the only Federation vessel in this sector. Itreports normal operations. A Ferengi ship within communications rangealso reports nothing unusual. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor. Dealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show thehighest hand, you control the next bet. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is insufficient data to make such an assessment, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue. I would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at McKinleystation, the hatch casing was replaced with one which had anundetectable defect. I believe, sir, that the conclusion to ourinvestigation must be that the explosion was not intentional. <eos> <bos> DATA: Consider, Captain, this programme has entered an alien data base,ours, and in less than seven hours has managed to not only learn oursystems, but has begun to reprogram our computer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker. I am receiving a Code Forty Seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, your transmission has been received <eos> <bos> DATA: Pleased? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Universal Translator is coming on line,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. Wewill give more attention to the rhythmic patterns at our nextrehearsal. However, I am quite certain the audience was oblivious tosuch nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree. But based on the size of the rift, it should give ussufficient time to complete the rescue. Computer, initiate nacellefield saturation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then in what way is it different? <eos> <bos> DATA: He is alive. What appeared in the form of Captain Rice is anintelligence gathering device used during the Ersalrope Wars. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering hasbeen abandoned. There is no one there to fix the problem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a limitation we must learn to accept, Lal. <eos> <bos> DATA: She is his grandmother, Captain. He was born fourteen years agoon the Federation colony, Galen Four. His parents, Connor and MoiraRossa, were killed three years, nine months later when their colony wasoverrun by Talarian forces. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? <eos> <bos> DATA: The energy field will eventually penetrate our shields. There isno way to counter the Paxans' technology. We can delay their takeoverbut we cannot prevent it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop. Stop. Stop. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the shuttle is entering the corona. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown. But it is definitely reacting to our presence. Perhapsit is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excellent, Doctor. We still have seventeenminutes left. I will inform the away team immediately. Enterprise toRiker. <eos> <bos> DATA: Changing to twenty pulses per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no indication of anything near the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Android, of course, is correct, but I fail to see how chaperon isapplicable in this situation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Go ahead, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fire. Fire! <eos> <bos> DATA: Have you tried, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a human physiological response to humour. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is definitely the street on which theintelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir. Adjusting for theoptical distortions, I am able to verify the architectural features. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am fine. <eos> <bos> DATA: With permission to dig for the mine shaft. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. That will not be possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: At the rate the rupture is expanding, we will soon be in dangerof hull breach. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: Timothy, you understand that you may speak with me about anythingyou wish? Any subject? <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There isonly one Juliana mentioned in them. Her last name was O'Donnell. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasmareactor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nine metres and closing. The energy output ofthe entity has doubled, Commander. Six metres. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then why are you here? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The fragmentation effect is increasing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays. We arebeing boarded, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir, I cannot. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed becausesome of the wood had rotted. Did I do something wrong, Garvin? <eos> <bos> DATA: Considering the power demonstrated by Q the last time, anywhere. Assuming this place even exists. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am fully versed, sir, on all your theories regarding time andgravity. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is why the ship's forward sensors did not detect theminitially. We were looking at them along their edge. There was nosurface to read. I will illustrate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: They appear to be empty, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did I say something wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. We are unable to encompass the entire moon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I do not understand how this could have happened. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see no reason to delay our departure. The chroniton fields havebeen cleared from all critical areas. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready to dock, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I wouldfind this entire procedure insulting. <eos> <bos> DATA: The computer is processing the data. I will be notified as soonas there is any information. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you do not believe I should pursue this any further. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the timerift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousandkilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicateit could be the remains of a Federation escape pod. Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted aCardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captorand was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassianspace. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in thecaves underneath the planet's surface. This is the information yourequested, is it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you not wish to sleep, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have notbeen damaged by our landing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are Doctor Juliana Tainer. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a reasonable conclusion. Borg technology has given eachmember of their society the ability to interface and functioncollectively. It is likely they have constructed their ship with thesame philosophy. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems. Nointernal organs. Cellular structure unknown. It does not have anyproteins which are known to us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Obviously, I am not. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not recognise the sound. I believe it is coming from above. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no change in the graviton field. The torpedoes arehaving no effect, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Naturally occurring? <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am from the twenty fourth century, where you and I serve aboarda starship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engage secondary tractor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am curious as to what transpired between the moment when I wasnothing more than an assemblage of parts in Doctor Soong's laboratory,and the next moment, when I became alive. What was it that endowed mewith life? <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not concern yourself, Inspector. Youhave enough on your mind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. This is the only way. The safest way to proceed is forme to cross alone. The heat and toxic gases have less effect on me. <eos> <bos> DATA: His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age fifty five, occupationfinancier. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are welcome, sir. If I can be of further assistance <eos> <bos> DATA: Your ship's design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict theexhaust flow. That coil is misaligned. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion. <eos> <bos> DATA: On my way, sir. Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are in good hands. <eos> <bos> DATA: I thought they were extinct. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry to bother you, but I have a question of a personalnature. Do you have a moment? <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Riker. Message from Starfleet, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since we know nothing of these circumstances, it is at leastconceivable, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twelve minutes to structural failure, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The first indication occurred when we were digging. I saw herperform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, I disagree. Captain, there is nothing in this room toindicate it was used as a military command centre. Perhaps atransporter room? <eos> <bos> DATA: What about fire? <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain, Commander, but the dimensions are precisely the same. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility accesscorridors. <eos> <bos> DATA: To make the modifications and search the entire Devron systemwill take approximately fourteen hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is a traditional gift? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. We should speak to Commander La Forge. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would not be possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. None. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are life signs. However, sensor readings are highlydistorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms. <eos> <bos> DATA: Please continue with record scan. Intriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising. Iam having difficulty establishing a pattern lock. Boostthe confinement beam, please. Pattern lock established. <eos> <bos> DATA: The test ship has successfully entered warp, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And will we also discuss, Lore, which of us was constructed first? <eos> <bos> DATA: We have located a new home for the Boraalans, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will run the integrity scan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry andrepair it two hours later? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a high degree of probability that you are correct. <eos> <bos> DATA: We're right next to it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, afluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. We would have to surround the core with a subspaceisolation field. It is not possible to generate a field of thatmagnitude from the runabout. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors show life forms aboard, but I am unable to ascertainwhether they are awake or dormant. However, the vessel's propulsionsystems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together we willdestroy the Federation. To Be Continued... <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Lore. I now have duties to perform. Unless of course,you need something more. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, since we obtained only minimal information on our sensorpass of it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening 19thcentury Earth. I investigated, and was inadvertently pulled into theirtemporal vortex. When I saw your photograph in the newspaper, I assumedyou had joined me from the future, from the Enterprise. I knew yourspecies was long-lived, but I did not realise you had visited Earth solong ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am aware of the difficulties. Please bring the phasers backonline. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am reading a massive energy fluctuation in theplanet's atmosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: The data from the Barzan's probe of thewormhole are quite impressive, Captain. The wormhole delivered theprobe beyond the Denkiri Arm, in the Gamma Quadrant. <eos> <bos> DATA: There was a evidence of a delayed surface shock. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we maintain our current speed, two hours, twenty threeminutes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure, sir, that Icannot say. Sir, I am finding it difficult to understand many aspectsof Ansata conduct. Much of their behavioral norm would be defined by myprogramme as unnecessary and unacceptable. <eos> <bos> DATA: The border outpost reports a contingent of seven Romulanbattlecruisers within sensor range. The Berlin has answered thedistress call. However, should hostilities erupt, both the outpost andthe starship will be out-gunned. It is felt that the Enterprise'spresence in the area will be a vital show of force. <eos> <bos> DATA: Attempting new power subcommand path. <eos> <bos> DATA: Guinan. <eos> <bos> DATA: To what effect, sir? We are faced with an impossible conundrum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markingswe discovered are consistent with this hypothesis. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have encountered the numeral three an inordinate number oftimes over the last two hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I have no experience in such matters. I requireadvice. <eos> <bos> DATA: It was you who <eos> <bos> DATA: The power grid is located beneath this deck, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is similar to our tractor beam, sir, onlymuch more powerful. <eos> <bos> DATA: The warp core breach has been reversed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The alternative is Vacca Six. It is located in the Cabral sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are inside Graves' home. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in thatroom, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, what are your intentions toward my daughter? <eos> <bos> DATA: There do not appear to be any unusual readings. Energy residualsfrom the plasma burns, the beginnings of cellular decomposition. I seenothing that connects these bio-readings to your recent sense ofdiscontinuity. <eos> <bos> DATA: The power reaching those monitors has been diverted from theBridge, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the child is the source of the unusual radiation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> DATA: Undetermined. <eos> <bos> DATA: You may retain the surplus for yourself. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would require construction and design specifications, fullorthographic representations of the Krieger equipment, as well asvisual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved. Butit is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it is likely the anomalous readings were the result of thewormhole's effect. It was extremely unstable. I would recommend againstreturning. It might put the Enterprise at further risk. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been told that imitation is the highest form of flattery. <eos> <bos> DATA: Dytallix B is the fifth of six planets circling the red giantknown as Mira. One side always faces the sun, where temperatures reachup to one hundred and eighty degrees. The mines line the temperate zonebetween the day and night sides, but they are long deserted. <eos> <bos> DATA: The creature is now in direct contact with the hull, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Set phasers to twenty five percent. Return fire. <eos> <bos> DATA: He wanted to. Every waking moment. And he wanted you to knowthat. You were everything to him. {Graves' body is in a torpedo case, wearing ashroud.) <eos> <bos> DATA: Over here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Establishing computer linkup. Interface complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitiveculture, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I could move the beam, sir. However, it may initiate the collapseof the surrounding supports. I recommend you and Geordi return to theship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spot does not respond to verbal commands. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, our sensors indicate that the microbrain expends atremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle. Yet there isno discernible power drain on our own systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of all performers available, who is considered funniest? <eos> <bos> DATA: The interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth squarekilometres. It will take seven hours to completely scan the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: By developing the awareness to examine and question yourperceptions. <eos> <bos> DATA: My service experience does not yet warrant such a position. <eos> <bos> DATA: I said the process should take less than two hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I wish your work on the particle fountain hadbeen more successful. Perhaps the exocomps will help you to reconstructit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, the process of cryonics was never more than a fad, anddid not continue much beyond the mid-twenty first century. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Bridge. Mister Worf, activate the deflector. <eos> <bos> DATA: For the past several hours, I have been scanning the area wherewe detected the resonance signature of the Pegasus. From the strengthand polarity of the signature, it would appear that most of the warpcore is still intact. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be advisable to monitor that cough. I have read thatthere is currently a cholera epidemic in San Francisco. <eos> <bos> DATA: The moon's altitude is fifty five thousand kilometres. Projectedorbit is circular. There is no further danger to the planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Coordinates one four zero by two zero five, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Any more disruptions and I will rule you in contempt of court. Isthat understood? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck thirtynine. Highly focused, very powerful but of unknown origin. <eos> <bos> DATA: This procedure will only increase the conversion level by pointeight percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am curious. Do you still think the real Kahless will returnsomeday? Or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisiswhich originally sent you to Boreth? <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have good news. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have encountered <eos> <bos> DATA: We discovered two instances of unexplained coma on Nel Threewhile the Ullians were there, but Tarmin was not part of the group. Further examination revealed that only one Ullian was present at allincidents of coma. Jev. Captain's log, stardate 45435.8. Doctor Crusher andCommander Riker regained consciousness while we were en route to theUllian home world. The slow process of their recovery has begun. <eos> <bos> DATA: Security alert. Medical emergency team to the Observation lounge. Data to Bridge. Raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenaryship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, the engine core is completely inactive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander La Forge, please report. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. We will keep searching, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, where are the Captain and CommanderRiker? <eos> <bos> DATA: Eventually, I developed a programmeenabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fully, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which is used in our construction. That particular compound is nomore suspicious, sir, than a human looking for an antiseptic or anointment. Nevertheless, I should check it out. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed weexperienced an intense sensor echo. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitriousfilament I mentioned. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe we have found the source of theradiation. Can you join us on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> DATA: And who, precisely, is us? <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-timecontinuum. Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragmentswe observed earlier. However, it is approximately one point two milliontimes asintense. I believe this may be the origin of the temporalfragmentation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Given what is now happening to our ship, sir, their weapons couldbe vastly superior to ours. <eos> <bos> DATA: He laughed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thrusters at half power. Three quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perfectly, Commander. I will be monitoring you continuously. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. And, Commander, continue your work. When you areready, I will still be here. I find some of what you proposeintriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enter. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must see the Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: As a matter of fact, I find it oddly amusing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I recommend we use a gravitron polarimeter. It will perform asimilar function. <eos> <bos> DATA: When Counsellor Troi is unhappy, she usually eats somethingchocolate. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanning the planet, sir. No life forms, no power sources, noweapons systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: It did not register on the tricorder. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello, Timothy. May I enter? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct asearch would be consistent with the spirit of the Treaty. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot become nervous, sir. However, I do sense a certainanticipation regarding my role in the wedding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we have located the source of the energy residual. It appears to be concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. All external sensors still nonfunctioning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently so. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, it is highly unlikely. <eos> <bos> DATA: The alien who attacked me has vanished, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate an increased level of baryon particles in thecabin. <eos> <bos> DATA: I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch beingblown. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stand by. <eos> <bos> DATA: Reduced to the mere facts of the events. The substance, theflavour of the moment, could be lost. Take games of chance. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sphere appears to be abandoned. Sensorsshow that the star is extremely unstable. It is experiencing severebursts of radiation and matter expulsions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Conceivably, the ship's power distribution nodes are vulnerableto those frequencies. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Five months, fourteen days, eleven hours, two minutes <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos> <bos> DATA: So Lal now possesses the sum of myprogramming. <eos> <bos> DATA: If she knew she were an android, we would have something toshare. I would no longer be alone in the universe. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am rarely in need of Doctor BeverlyCrusher's professional services as my bio-mechanical maintenanceprogramme is self sufficient. But I often observe as she practicesmedicine on others and have learned a great deal about humaninteraction from her. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have surveyed all the turbolifts and service crawlways on thisdeck. Access to the Bridge has been completely severed by emergencybulkheads. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you could arrange for us to get in. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in allits forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to livingbeings. <eos> <bos> DATA: But pain is unpleasant, is it not? <eos> <bos> DATA: The Pagh is either cloaked or destroyed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And you conclude because of this that I am impartial. Hence, youaccept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not. <eos> <bos> DATA: The power source, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hear that? What do those footfalls tell you,Watson? <eos> <bos> DATA: We were incorrect, sir. I have determined that time is movingforward at an infinitesimal rate. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on ournavigational charts. However, sensors indicate the presence of anextremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is even more significant than the object itself, Counsellor. On several of its surfaces, the molecules seem to have disintegrated <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I should re-align the ship's clock with Starbase four ten'ssubspace signal to adjust for the time distortion. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will be back. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will have the report sent to you, sir. We are still on coursefor the Gariman sector. Our speed is warp six, thirteen hundredhours. Sickbay reported one minor injury in the exobiology departmentat zero four twenty hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: Probe has been launched. On screen. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are aware, Counsellor, that the holodeck can be programmed torecreate an oceanic environment. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would like that very much. <eos> <bos> DATA: Based on its present trajectory, the cometappears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. <eos> <bos> DATA: One moment. The phase buffer is functioning within normalparameters. Sensor efficiency has increased by six point seven percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible, sir, that the events leading to my death will notoccur for years, even centuries. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are within transporter range. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi? Is Counsellor Troi with you? <eos> <bos> DATA: We will be entering the Turkana system ineleven minutes, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: My memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption duringthat time period. My internal chronometer and the ship's computer areboth perfectly synchronised. There does not appear to be a temporaldiscrepancy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Strange. The transceiver assembly has been removed. Without it Iwill be unable to track the time shifts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you really think it is possible? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, drop the shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Monitors are functioning normally again. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe he found what he was looking for, Counsellor. Captain's log, supplemental. With all main systemsat least temporarily restored, we are proceeding to Starbase one fivetwo for inspection and additional repairs. We have had no furtherencounter with the Romulans. As for the whereabouts of Tin Man and TamElbrun, we can only speculate. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periodsyou described. Events in one time period would seem to have no effecton the other two. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds remaining. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a lie. Another lie. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are scanning us, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is large. Approximately two hundred kilograms. It is heavilyarmored with an exoskeleton. Life signs appear to be Klingon. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will find Moriarty this way, sir. The warehouse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Computer, reset simulation totime index two point one. Increase Borg strength by thirty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Worf, that is an order. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exactly. As I experience certain sensory input patterns, mymental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually areanticipated, and even missed when absent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise history. Aberrant behavior. Medical cross reference, <eos> <bos> DATA: It's off the scale, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. They are withdrawing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. You are attempting to recreate the Dokkaran temple of KuralHanesh? <eos> <bos> DATA: Difficult? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah! Intriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: So you wiped my memory processors after this childhood. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Keiko's wedding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Questionable, sir. I believe I can supply power to its playbackunit, but its components are quite old. I will attempt to amplify itsimage with my tricorder. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was looking for Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs. Apparently when they are in these slots, they become part of the wholeand no longer read as separate life forms. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sector one nine six five eight, sir. I am unable to access it'smain computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location. <eos> <bos> DATA: We do, sir, and your referring to him as an it suggests that I,too, fit into the category of a thing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, that is not an appropriate basis for an effectiveperformance. Not by the standards set by my mentors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you be more specific? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors still show nothing out there. <eos> <bos> DATA: In relative terms, perhaps not. Nevertheless, it seems clear thatmy life is to end in the late nineteenth century. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot help them. Captain, please take me back to Ramatis. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are still many human emotions I do not fullycomprehend. Anger, hatred, revenge. But I am not mystified by thedesire to be loved or the need for friendship. These are things I dounderstand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of amalfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been monitoring Geordi's progress. It will be operationalin seventeen minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not possible. The onboard control systems for everystarship require a user code clearance. You could not haveinadvertently affected any of the Vico's systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant? 2 <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. Standard air pressure has been reestablished in theObservation lounge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, eighty years ago the Lornaks massacred a rival clan,the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest this evening for asmall audience. I would like for you to attend. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are very good with people. <eos> <bos> DATA: Humanoid. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are now entering position. Radiationlevels are rising. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then despite whatever options he is given, he must be <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a good guess. <eos> <bos> DATA: Our destination is a point near the Boradis system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: Cat? <eos> <bos> DATA: If we are to adhere to the exact letter of Starfleet regulations,then technically, sir, you have been declared a renegade. In fact, Ibelieve you are facing twelve counts of court martial offences. Youcannot give orders either, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am scanning all seven planets of the Vilmoran system. Noneappears to support life. <eos> <bos> DATA: The game is five card draw, no limit. Ante, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been anoutbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. Weare on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague andtransport them to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully anantidote can be produced. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a recorded message, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away fromthe edge of the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hello? <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Still no damage to the Borg vessel, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Beginning sensor sweeps. <eos> <bos> DATA: Long range sensors detect a T-tauri type starwithin a pocket of the Ngame cloud. <eos> <bos> DATA: Really, Grandpa? <eos> <bos> DATA: Should I pursue a relationship with Lieutenant D'Sora? <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering, this is Science One. I have just observed whatappeared to be a random energy transference. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot say. The electromagnetic interference prevents anaccurate reading. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Your service record to date suggests that you would perform thatfunction adequately. <eos> <bos> DATA: I should not have resumed my painting? <eos> <bos> DATA: Babble, sir? I'm not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may bethat from time to time I have considerable information to communicate,and you may question the way I organise it. <eos> <bos> DATA: What kind of receiver would be capable of processing thesesignals? <eos> <bos> DATA: A small moon orbiting the fourth planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Theories, reports, but nothing first-hand. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. It appears to be a smaller, less developed version ofthe original creature. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least several hours. But what I said was a statement of fact. Perhaps she will look it up. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I have noticed that you have not shaved. Are youattempting to grow another beard? <eos> <bos> DATA: Honey? I'm home. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apologies, Captain. I seem to have reached an odd functionalimpasse. I am stuck. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field. I am unable to scanwithin the vessels. <eos> <bos> DATA: It happened just a few moments ago, in my arms. Ira Graves isdead. Captain's log, supplemental. I leave Gravesworldwith an empty feeling and the knowledge that our mission wasunsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about tounlock have been lost forever. Our immediate priority is to reach thenearest starbase so that Graves' assistant can get on with her life. <eos> <bos> DATA: When I play poker with my shipmates, it often appears to be auseful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity. I wascurious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact inthis setting. So far, it has proved most illuminating. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yet you have chosen a Vulcan way of life. <eos> <bos> DATA: Between the inhabitants of their two land masses, resulting inone group unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree that is a possibility. Captain, I suggest we ask theFederation Science Council to send a research vessel to this area. Amore detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to mybrother. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. The breach can be temporarily sealed byextending our shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: The molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles. We may beable to derive a pattern the computer would recognise. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot reproduce your performance if I cannot see your feet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, but it is all right. Do you need me? <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, it is five point three four times ten to the fortyfirst watts, sir. Well within the norm for this type of phenomena. <eos> <bos> DATA: The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars asarms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advancedweaponry. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to employ plasma inputs. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Barclay's performance was adequate, but clearly notrooted in The Method approach. I do not understand why. <eos> <bos> DATA: The area around the duck blind exhibits Karst topography. Sinkholes, underground rivers, and caverns. And the rock strata containa high concentration of thallium compounds which may be obstructing oursensor beams. <eos> <bos> DATA: Run programme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Stubbs, your own actions have provided evidence to thecontrary. When you destroyed the nanites in the core, they responded byinterfering with our life support systems. It is difficult to acceptthese as random actions by machines with loose screws. In effect, youmay have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am always careful. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is unfortunate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do understand, and I am attempting to explain to you it isimpossible. <eos> <bos> DATA: The beam is fully restored, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: On most, there are brief sections which may yield someinformation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gia, I believe I have found the answer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanners show no other life forms on the planet, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is not reversible, sir. The subtle molecular transposition of <eos> <bos> DATA: The seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted. <eos> <bos> DATA: If the Hera is on the surface, its hull could not possiblywithstand the pressure of the atmosphere. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no evidence of an advanced communication network. <eos> <bos> DATA: Opening my eyes. Looking into the eyes of the Tripoli landingparty. They believed that the signal device sensed their presence andactivated me. <eos> <bos> DATA: It will take approximately nine and one half hours to completethe analysis. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, I live here now. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will stay with Wesley, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The two-dimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitationalpull of the string. Their course is taking them directly toward it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Pulse frequency out of pre-fire chamber reads steady. <eos> <bos> DATA: This will need a completely new field induction subprocessor. Itappears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: She studies in our quarters. She requires very littlesupervision. Lal is quite self-sufficient. <eos> <bos> DATA: My circulatory system not only produces bio-chemical lubricants,it regulates micro-hydraulic power. Most people are interested in myextraordinary abilities. How fast I can compute, my memory capacity,how long I will live. No one has ever asked me if my hair will grow, ornoticed that I can breathe. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not aware of Regulation six point five seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initial scans of ionisation patternscomplete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, is the appellation Junior to be the life form's officialname? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net. I willneed to do further testing before I proceed. Someone will come and takeyou back to your cell. <eos> <bos> DATA: The master criminal. The man Holmes could only defeat at the costof his own life at Reichenbach Falls. Our adversary, my dear Watson, isnone other than Professor Moriarty himself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Were you prepared, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: If being human is not simply a matter of being born fleshand blood, if it is instead a way of thinking, acting and feeling, thenI am hopeful that one day I will discover my own humanity. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of herdisappearance. While you claim to be just passing by, that is mostlikely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortablesubject. Am I correct? <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant? May I ask a question? In the absence of empiricaldata, how will you determine whether or not this is the real Kahless? <eos> <bos> DATA: Given the effects we have observed, the probability isexceedingly remote, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: But if that is so, Captain, why are their methods so oftensuccessful? I have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and itappears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change. <eos> <bos> DATA: How was the seminar? <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should go aboard the Romulan ship. The answer to thatquestion may <eos> <bos> DATA: Nice to see you, Wesley. <eos> <bos> DATA: One enemy target hit, sir. Moderate damage to their forwardshields. Our shields are still holding. Minor damage to secondary hull. <eos> <bos> DATA: You mentioned your impending death, Grandpa. May I say you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism. <eos> <bos> DATA: My memory core and neural nets are self-contained. I would befine, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are a challenging opponent, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuinecuriosity. <eos> <bos> DATA: Antimatter injector online. Reducing flow capacity. Commencingwarp engine shut down, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore, sir. He was inadvertently summoned here by the same signalwhich activated my homing circuitry. It seems that after nearly twoyears in interstellar space, he was <eos> <bos> DATA: Your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart. AndCaptain Picard has authorised me to share with you any information weobtain from the Romulan databanks. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe so, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The distortion is extremely weak, sir. It appears to be movingslowly. It is gone, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Twenty six minutes. After that, the distortion field willre-phase. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. They appear to be quasi-energy microbes thatexist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Impact in seventeen seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasmainfusion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Armus is capable of creating undefined forcefields. In effect, weare powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allowsit. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hit me. <eos> <bos> DATA: In that particular moment, I was reconfiguring the warp fieldparameters, analysing the collected works of Charles Dickens,calculating the maximum pressure I could safely apply to your lips,considering a new food supplement for Spot. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I see no way for you to journey with an energy form. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I have found that humans often use small talk duringawkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for thatpurpose. How did I do? <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that not what I said? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have located the shuttle. It is under attack. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would be most beneficial. <eos> <bos> DATA: And at the moment it is all pure speculation. He has done nothingto subject the Enterprise to danger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starfleet Command believes the Lysians are using a new weaponwhich has shifted the balance of power to their favour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released. <eos> <bos> DATA: I don't. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher and I have been working on an interesting premise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: An impulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet,Commander. The dynamics of the radiation patterns <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There are two possible destinations. The BrechtianCluster and the Argos system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Query. Eager beaver? <eos> <bos> DATA: To someone, somewhere. <eos> <bos> DATA: They should add that Starfleet has permitted severalcivilisations to fall. We have at times allowed the strong and violentto overcome the weak. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be a quantum fissure in the space-time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there a malfunction? <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a most lethal weapon. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead. <eos> <bos> DATA: Miranda's first encounter with other human beings. <eos> <bos> DATA: You had nothing! <eos> <bos> DATA: It is part of her training programme. I am teaching Spot to jumpdown from the desk on my command. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would not have thought it possible, sir. I am eager to test thesuccess of our efforts. It doesremain to be seen if the Romulans will accept us. Captain, you haveseemed unusually pensive since we received the news of AmbassadorSarek's death. <eos> <bos> DATA: Weeks. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, the computer will require the voice authorisations of twosenior officers in order to disable the safety routine. Will you helpme? <eos> <bos> DATA: Not any longer, sir. The star went nova. All life in the systemwas destroyed approximately one thousand years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Greetings, gentlemen. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it. <eos> <bos> DATA: All routes are equally dangerous, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am certain that you could. <eos> <bos> DATA: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes,several of which I fell victim to. <eos> <bos> DATA: One might also conclude that it brings me one step closer tobeing human. I am mortal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors have located the transportship. Two Rekag battle cruisers are flanking it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminatedapproximately five hundred years ago. That would be consistent with theother artefacts we recovered. <eos> <bos> DATA: We must shut it down. <eos> <bos> DATA: Little is known. She was born on Daled Four. Her parents werefrom opposite sides in a civil war which has lasted for centuries. Theyboth died shortly after her birth. A Federation ship brought her andher governess to Klavdia Three so that she could be raised in a neutralenvironment. <eos> <bos> DATA: The appearance of Kahless in the lava caves is consistent withthe stories found in the Klingon sacred texts. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which would you place first, the welfare of a single individualor that of the entire crew? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am reading unusual subspace energy in your vicinity, similar towhat the probe sensor recorded the first time you encountered yourmother. <eos> <bos> DATA: Whatever it is, sir, we seem to be inside it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Again, insufficient information, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Right over there, sir. Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Children often do not develop discerning palettes until wellbeyond adolescence. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have determined that the storage cube from John Doe's escapepod contains navigational information. <eos> <bos> DATA: If Bok uses his transporter again, we might be able to trace thesubspace signature and locate his ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: I don't know. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have verified receipt of the access codes for the Lantree,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Isolate all remaining command functions and accept related ordersand inquiries from main Bridge only. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Acknowledged, sir. We are on our way. <eos> <bos> DATA: The wave has closed to one kilometre,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain. I am now receiving a message from Starfleet Command. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, Commander Riker's injury was not accidental. Certainvines on the planet evidently seek out warm-blooded beings anddeliberately infect them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lal? I am unable to correct the systemfailure. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was never actually a possibility. The wormhole's small sizeand relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will be more observant in the future, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I have overexerted myself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything. It is a void without matter or energy of any kind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Five minutes to launch site. <eos> <bos> DATA: One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment,I had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, Commander. Overall exposure is less than seventy five rems. Very low intensity, more like a soft medical scan. I would speculate weare being probed. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you desire privacy, you may use the Observation lounge. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is an interesting hypothesis. If I ambeing affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level,it may also explain my waking dreams, and my subsequent anti-socialbehaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is true. Q's interest in you has always been very similar tothat of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not at this time, sir. There is insufficient evidence to do so. In order to determine whether or not a rift will form, region must beexposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greaterthan that normally generated by a starship. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances, butwe're limited by the equipment on the Pasteur. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: Until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient, I would notrecommend it, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: What are you looking at? You, Klingon. Attack me. Are you afraid? <eos> <bos> DATA: Four point seven million kilometres, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am Data. An android. <eos> <bos> DATA: The planet is subject to frequent sandstorms. Footprints mighthave been obliterated prior to your arrival. Doctor Crusher and I willbegin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these withsome known life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister O'Brien, energise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me for interrupting, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have tried it from time to time. But you are correct. I do notrequire rest. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why did you do that? <eos> <bos> DATA: The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profoundfeelings while under extreme duress. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly thatthreatened the Enterprise. It is possible that they triggered a safetydevice which caused the ship to avoid destruction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need muchpractice. <eos> <bos> DATA: He surprised me. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with thisexocomp in the past hour. I estimate it would take two people ninehours to complete the same tasks. I would characterise the unit'sperformance as excellent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: My upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstandextreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium. <eos> <bos> DATA: Compensating, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have some vivid memories of sporting events. He played parrisessquares with a group of his schoolmates. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did you help him with his research, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Dismissed. Mister Worf, I am sorry if I have ended ourfriendship. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. Intriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: The transfer itself is fairly simple. Eachneural pathway in my brain is duplicated precisely in hers. Theoretically, the duplicate brains should be able to store and processthe same information but until all of the transfers are complete, wewill not know for certain. <eos> <bos> DATA: The tractor beam will not be successful. I am decompressing themain shuttlebay. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are wrong, Captain. My brother and I serve a much higherpurpose. <eos> <bos> DATA: Outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven throughtwelve are exposed to space. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillionbits. My total linear computational speed has been rated at sixtytrillion operations per second. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starship separation in six, five, four, three, two, one. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not any more. He wants us to find him. <eos> <bos> DATA: It should not be. It is a harmless lambda field generator. <eos> <bos> DATA: Within the norm of Klingon patterns, of course. Discretion willbe required. <eos> <bos> DATA: All decks being probed in a methodical pattern, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir. I see time as aconstant, whereas humansperceive time as flexible. Hence the expression, times flies whenyou're having fun, which until now has always confused me. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. Only hearsay and third hand reports, most of whichconflict. <eos> <bos> DATA: I agree. Geordi, I believe I've experienced my first emotion. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have initialised the plasma induction coils. <eos> <bos> DATA: What am I doing here? <eos> <bos> DATA: Hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams. But I believe I canimprovise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuouslyrecollimating the output. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Accessing. Chief O'Brien served under his command aboard theRutledge, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. 1 <eos> <bos> DATA: Then I expect you to conform to the guidelines I have laid out. <eos> <bos> DATA: You do not wish to rehearse? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: In theory, a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasicresolution would be able to penetrate this much interference. TheDaystrom Institute has been working on such a device, but it is stillonly theoretical. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, have you been promoted in my absence? <eos> <bos> DATA: I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tending to your every need? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways. But I would gladly give it upto be human. <eos> <bos> DATA: We cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him. A higher setting may kill him. <eos> <bos> DATA: The human race has an enduring desire for knowledge, and for newopportunities to improve itself. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Human? <eos> <bos> DATA: The energy signature would seem to indicate a phaser-like blast. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is considered to be funny? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe we should leave them here,sir. With your permission, we will be returning with three containers. <eos> <bos> DATA: I successfully planted a command into theBorg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe itwas time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep. <eos> <bos> DATA: Will cancelling the wedding make you happy? <eos> <bos> DATA: Did Moriarty release the voice commands, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: Temperature in the reaction chamber has returned to normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: You continually question my orders in front of the crew. I do notbelieve this is appropriate behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Modifications are complete. <eos> <bos> DATA: True. Nevertheless, it is possible that the phenomenon couldoccur in matter at much higher levels of organisation, given the properconditions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engaging computer override. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative, sir. The field is also acting as a tractor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I am picking up massive triolicwave activity on the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suspect the number was much greater. My impression is thatthere were thousands, of all ages and walks of life. It was aremarkable experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: A Federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, I have no memory of you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Marr, Raymond. Called Renny. Yes. I do. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is the Federation Starship Enterprise. You are ordered tostand down. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wish to speak. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Presumed destroyed. The Enterprise C was last seen near theKlingon outpost Narendra Three exactly twenty two years, three monthsand four days ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force inthe cause of defense. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data? Before me, he was nothing. Just a walking tin can withcircuits for intestines. Pathetic. Without heart, a man is meaningless. I would not come up here if I were you, Captain. I might not like it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this is a life form. Not to allow it to developnaturally would deny us the opportunity to study it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. Downloading. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is a certain degree of random fortune involved. I believethat is why they call it gambling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constantof the universe is beyond our capabilities. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we are being too literal. I have recently learned in mystudy of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimesrepresent different aspects of the person who is dreaming. <eos> <bos> DATA: How far, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: The structure of the bulkhead has been altered on a subatomiclevel. The metal itself is in a state of quasi-molecular flux. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are concerned, of course, Captain, but confident. Do you notsee that, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: If the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty onepoints, I will definitely need another card. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would also not be an atypical Romulan ploy, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is correct. It seems unlikely that Jo'Bril would performsabotage which would result in his own death. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. I do not suppose I will ever really know. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have always felt that it was done hurriedly, but I know littlemore. Here, sir. This is where the cruiser's landing party found thesignal device that had led them here. And they found me lying there,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: And for this opportunity, she is willing to provide services toassist you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thirty seconds, Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You suggested a plan that would work to your advantage, one thatI would be capable of executing. You then implied a reward. Clearly youwere <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to the Barzan probe, we should be in the Gamma Quadrantbut these readings clearly indicate we are nearlytwo hundred light years away in sector three five five six of the DeltaQuadrant. <eos> <bos> DATA: No active subspace fields. Negligible power readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have traced her comm. badge signal to deck seventeen, sectiontwenty one alpha. <eos> <bos> DATA: Slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulationframe collapsed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, locate Ensign Ro. <eos> <bos> DATA: The satellite's trajectory is continuing todeteriorate, Captain. This orbit will put it within five hundredkilometres of the planet surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you suggesting that it employs memory like an organiccell? <eos> <bos> DATA: understanding the Prime Directive, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. The nature of their movement suggests a simple order ofintelligence. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I may, Captain? Objection, your honour. In the year 2036, thenew United Nations declared that no Earth citizencould be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: We are approaching Starbase one seven nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, perform a narrow bandwidth analysis. Eliminate allnon-vocal waveform components. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increasing by fifty percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it was a repulsor beam. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is very good to see you both again. Beverly. May I call youBeverly? Beverly, have you noticed that the mean temperature here onArkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels? I havefound that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degreesCelsius in order to operate most efficiently. However, there areseveral cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature isidentical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing. The Sheliak, for example. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no question about it, sir. It is hissignal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, afluctuation of <eos> <bos> DATA: Lunar Five is a military prison facility. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant Worf, please report to Engineering. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can give her attention, Doctor. But I am incapable of givingher love. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ready, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: But it was proven to be fatal. To use this technology would be anirrational act. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, there are four warbirds holding position on the Romulanside of the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have none, sir. I recommend we launch a probe. <eos> <bos> DATA: Danar is extremely adept, sir. I am not certain which securitymeasure he is attempting to circumvent. Sir, Danar has succeeded inrestoring power to shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was nopermanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull. <eos> <bos> DATA: The reading I received is from behind thisdoor, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know, sir. It does not appear to have a skeletalframework or musculature. <eos> <bos> DATA: They recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at thepresent Edo stage of evolution. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know the way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. It has become clearthat everyone aboard the Enterprise has lost an entire day. As themystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continuesto deepen, so do my doubts about Commander Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Specifics, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Because you failed in your task? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, I need some visual assistance. <eos> <bos> DATA: After you. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course. May I ask a personal favour? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, if we can get close enough to Geordi, we can read hisabsorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light. <eos> <bos> DATA: My name. It is pronounced Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant. That is precisely what we must do. Since there are no viable alternatives, we will return to the surfaceand attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on thisplanet. An investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose. Please notify me when you have assembled your search teams. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, thrusters are losing power. <eos> <bos> DATA: But there was no mention that my father was married to you. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: The third is just coming into range now, sir. It is AmbassadorClass heavy cruiser, Horatio. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing specific, sir. As you know, Ferengi technology isestimated to be generally equal to our own. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: If your theory is correct, the Cardassians may be planning anattack somewhere in this sector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Exocomps are highly sophisticated devices, sir. If they performup to expectation, their potential to advance this project isconsiderable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is, but I can tellyou what it is not. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you requested, I will now remind you of the reasons youdecided to end your relationship with Jeff. <eos> <bos> DATA: I realise that, sir. But if he were, and he wanted to lead anaway team, you would tell him that the Captain's place is <eos> <bos> DATA: I am familiar with many Klingon rituals, including the B'aht Qul. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is Data, standing by to beam up. <eos> <bos> DATA: I formally refuse to undergo your procedure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Angel One has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy. It isgoverned by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected Mistresses,and headed by a female they refer to as The Elected One. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand your concerns. Request denied. <eos> <bos> DATA: I now realise that my life aboard theEnterprise was a waste. My quest to become human was misguided. Anevolutionary step in the wrong direction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. But emotions were responsible for what I did to you. I wouldnever risk letting that happen again. My friendship with you is tooimportant to me. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is the best place for us to start. <eos> <bos> DATA: He's only dazed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No response. Rana Four is emissions quiet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps that would explain why our sensors did not detect him. <eos> <bos> DATA: But sir, peridaxon <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah. Then to burn the midnight oil implies late work? <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I am detecting a transmission emanating from within thesystem. <eos> <bos> DATA: Someone else will have to speak with them, not me. Not after whatI allowed to happen/ How could I? <eos> <bos> DATA: According to Starfleet records, Pierce and the other personsCounsellor Troi identified, were killed in an accidental plasmadischarge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred differentvocalisations. <eos> <bos> DATA: I see. The concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then let me offer an alternative. Transport me to the station, Iwill attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream. <eos> <bos> DATA: The planet's proximity to its sun will create two additionaltransport windows in the next three days. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I said that. <eos> <bos> DATA: If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, display progress of genetic re-sequencing. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels. They took control of Counsellor Troi's body to communicate with us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictableevent. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko may nothave had sufficient warning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Based on the last assumed position of the Klingon vessel, itsapparent trajectory, and our estimates of their cruising speed, weshould be in scanner range in fifteen hours, eight minutes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Could you take me there? <eos> <bos> DATA: The entity has disengaged, sir. Power levels are returning tonormal, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were right, sir. I do tend to babble. Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever theobject or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a nemesis. It isone thing to communicate with something mysterious, but it is quiteanother to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether itunderstands the same concept of reason that we do? <eos> <bos> DATA: You are searching for instances of Iresine syndrome? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, sensors are detecting a subspace carrierwave headed for the ship. Its signature is consistent with Bok'stransporter. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you feeling all right? <eos> <bos> DATA: The lifeform is emitting its high frequencytransmission. Energy consumption is rising, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to setup the infusion units are somewhat unstable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would you like me to discontinue, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I appreciate your concern, Captain, but, to employ an aphorism,one cannot cheat fate. <eos> <bos> DATA: I only wish to help. <eos> <bos> DATA: What do we do if they deny the existence of survivors? <eos> <bos> DATA: Any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to bethat, sir. But when they were probing my thoughts, Captain, I couldfeel that whatever they are now, they once existed in this dimension,just as we do. Perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form. Sincethen, however, they have evolved considerably. Their present existencein multi-dimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand. <eos> <bos> DATA: They may have been attempting to eject their engine core. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate it is located thirty metres below the ground,implying a cavern-like dwelling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Have I said something to upset you? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It isgoing to be okay. I will count to three. One two three.  DATA <eos> <bos> DATA: The interface unit is operating within expected parameters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lore, I must deactivate you now. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps, Doctor, but there is no known method for controlling aneutron migration. <eos> <bos> DATA: Its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to theone that crashed. Interference from the star'sradiation will shield us from their sensors. We should remainundetected until they enter the system. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is ridiculous. I am as healthy as a Rigelian ox. <eos> <bos> DATA: The asteroid's internal structure is highly unstable. Any attemptto cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse. <eos> <bos> DATA: The transporters are considerably more efficient than those usedon the Potemkin eight years ago. <eos> <bos> DATA: You will surrender yourself to the authorities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Can I get you something? A beverage? <eos> <bos> DATA: Confirmed, sir. And there was a rather peculiar limerick beingdelivered by someone in the Shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure Iunderstand it. There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shapedlike <eos> <bos> DATA: The answer, sir, is that my loyalty is to you and Starfleet. Completely. <eos> <bos> DATA: The drag coefficient continues to increase. Our velocity has fallen by twelve percent. Velocity is increasing. Ship's speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Separation is successful, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Compare these variations with established Romulan replicationpatterns. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is that not Pardek? <eos> <bos> DATA: If you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zerohundred hours, it will activate the fire suppression system, whichwould seal off this entire compartment. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish. Jenna. Are we no longer a couple? <eos> <bos> DATA: Music? I do not hear anything. <eos> <bos> DATA: Clearly, Mister Fajo has no moral difficulty with my imprisonmenthere. <eos> <bos> DATA: The interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiencesare almost always culturally derived, and I have no culture of my own. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have located a vessel, sir. It is drifting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterpriseshuttlebay two, prepare for docking, level oneprecautions for incoming material remain in effect. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been testing the aphorism, 'a watched pot never boils'. Ihave boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times. Insome cases, I have ignored the kettle. In others, I have watched itintently. In every instance, the waterreaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one point seven seconds. It would appear that I am not capable of perceiving time anydifferently than my internal chronometer. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. The wave is continuing on course for the Lemma Twocolony. It is bearing zero two zero, mark three two nine. <eos> <bos> DATA: The planet was used as an outpost for the Debrune approximatelytwo thousand years ago. The Federation's Archaeological survey hascatalogued numerous ruins on the surface. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty sixseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards have been sufficientlyrandomised. <eos> <bos> DATA: Which, traveling subspace, they should receive in fifty-oneyears, ten months nine weeks, sixteen days <eos> <bos> DATA: Does the Admiral have children? <eos> <bos> DATA: You must hurry, Commander. The containment field has dropped tosixteen percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Her skills are empathic in nature. She is able to sense theemotions of other beings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Starboard nacelle sustained a direct impact. Venting driveplasma. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is wrong? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleetofficers on the Omicron Theta outpost. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> DATA: It would be unethical to take pleasure from another being'sdeath. <eos> <bos> DATA: There has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence,Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: So, by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine tothe third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distancebetween the Omicron system and the Crab Nebula. <eos> <bos> DATA: Slow to impulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: Many aspects of this situation are puzzling to me. I have beenstudying various texts on the subject of marriage, but I have not founda suitable guide. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes? <eos> <bos> DATA: The target must be specific, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Am I dancing, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: I suggest we take it to Engineering and run a completecircuit-pathway diagnostic. <eos> <bos> DATA: It appears to be an energy vortex of highly complex patterns. Possibly a life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: It does not bother me. In fact, I am happy to <eos> <bos> DATA: That action injured you, and saved me. I will not forget it. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you do not feel capable of carrying out this role, I willassign it to Commander La Forge and return you to Tactical. I would notenter it into your record as a reprimand, simply as a transfer. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. <eos> <bos> DATA: Radioactive. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well,Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain. When he froze Lieutenant Torres on the Bridge, we hadour Sickbay to help thaw him out. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are attempting to bribe me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Whatever you wish, dear. There we are. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am detecting a vessel holding position nearthe third planet. It is a Yridian freighter. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shield has severed the beam, sir. Captain, the energy field. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, sir. Perhaps it was my admirationfor Grandpa that got the best of me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Press your fingers there, Doctor. There. It operates almost as a switch. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. Are you not going toallow Tam to fulfill his mission? <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you saying the question cannot be answered? <eos> <bos> DATA: How? <eos> <bos> DATA: No. Too esoteric. More generic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Would you teach me how to dance? <eos> <bos> DATA: Curious. There seems to be a problem in the holodeck's spatialorientation systems. <eos> <bos> DATA: That would require an emotional context which I cannot provide. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then why are you stabilizing the conduit? <eos> <bos> DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. I believe that within six hours we could generate aconcentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the Tyken's rift. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Highly, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. But I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am your friend. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have reached the bridge, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate. <eos> <bos> DATA: You'll find this most intriguing, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a courseof action without consulting the commanding officer. <eos> <bos> DATA: What command shall I try to plant? <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: They've been made fully aware of the situation, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are most fortunate, my dear Captain, that I am not a violentman. <eos> <bos> DATA: The composition of the exposed rock face has been altered byexposure to triolic waves. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry for the disruption, but he would not believe me when Itold him we were friends. <eos> <bos> DATA: Visual contact. <eos> <bos> DATA: Engineering to Captain. If the antimatter is released,the ship will be destroyed. <eos> <bos> DATA: My hair does not require trimming <eos> <bos> DATA: A dimensional jump can create subspacepressure modulation, Captain. By setting up a magnetosphere echogramthat can monitor each of their movements, we may be able to collectenough data to trace their power source. <eos> <bos> DATA: My orders are to escort you to the Observation Lounge. Pleasecome with me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: A sensible precaution, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The plan was successful, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Early bird? I believe Commander Shelby erred. There is noevidence of avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on Jouret Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is logged in his own voice, sir. Would you care to hear it,sir? Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: A common mistake, sir, <eos> <bos> DATA: The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able todownload this old style disk drive back to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sorry sir, that did not come out quite the way I intended. <eos> <bos> DATA: Delta evasion plan initiated. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Disease? <eos> <bos> DATA: Energy cell usage remains constant at one point oh fivemegajoules per second. Curious. The efficiency reading on the dischargecrystal is well above Starfleet specifications. <eos> <bos> DATA: I wonder, what would Doctor Freud say about the symbolism ofdevouring oneself? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your decision was based on the assumption that cancelling thewedding would bring you happiness. This has proved to be incorrect. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are showing broadband emissions, including Berthold rays <eos> <bos> DATA: Bridge to Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, reset Borg simulation to time index two point one. Increase Borg strength by twenty percent. Runprogramme. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, Counsellor. It was Tam's final request that I explain hisdecision to the crew. But I believe his hope was that you wouldunderstand. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shape is a paradox, sir. It cannot exist in real space ortime. <eos> <bos> DATA: But he needs his study time. <eos> <bos> DATA: There appears to have been a malfunction in the holodeck'sdatabase retrievalprogramme. The two programs somehow temporarily linked together. <eos> <bos> DATA: You sent for me, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: I project a ninety percent probability that they will continue tosupport that policy. <eos> <bos> DATA: That the Ferengi are, well, the best description may be traders. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe it was pleasure. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonicstress levels. <eos> <bos> DATA: Judging from the residual temporal fluctuations, I believe theyhave returned to their own time continuum. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tip O'Neill. Accessing. Twentieth century male, politician,overweight, wearing female clothing, carrying a valise that looks likea fish. So, the juxtaposition of gender and an amphibian briefcase isfunny. <eos> <bos> DATA: Mister Comic, I wish to know what is funny. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am incapable of forgetting. I will remember every detail of myvisit here with perfect clarity. <eos> <bos> DATA: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> DATA: It seems that I must make a decision. Whetherto tell Doctor Tainer that she is an android or to withhold thatinformation from her. I do not know what to do. <eos> <bos> DATA: She has been abducted. <eos> <bos> DATA: The deflector dish has been reconfigured, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I may not understand human humour, sir, but I am a StarfleetAcademy graduate. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energising. <eos> <bos> DATA: But no one has actually seen one? <eos> <bos> DATA: Mordan has had peace for five years. They have finally come to astate of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but nomore than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation couldprovide them with more. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tricorder's useless, sir. Communication's gone too. Fortunatelyyou did not break any <eos> <bos> DATA: And Tasha did not? <eos> <bos> DATA: Make a full report to the flagship. Take the main phasers offlineand begin radiation clean up on the affected decks. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has all armament locked on us and ready to fire. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors locked on probes. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to the instruments, sir, our speed never exceeded warpone point five. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit. Iam detecting no bodies of water, no vegetation, no artificialstructures. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will verify it. Just as I thought. It is a Starfleet subspacedistress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Intrepid was the first ship on the scene, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is traveling at warp seven point six. Mass two pointfive million metric tons. Configuration, cubical. <eos> <bos> DATA: I detect no increase in the stress levels of the surroundingmagma. <eos> <bos> DATA: Completely, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi's examination was exemplary. <eos> <bos> DATA: You objected to the fact that he seemed unwilling to set asidesufficient time for you. You said he was unresponsive, that he neverdid the little things. You disliked the sound he made when he ate hissoup. <eos> <bos> DATA: Indeed? <eos> <bos> DATA: Main coupling is matching navigationalinputs, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: But why? <eos> <bos> DATA: Fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a rangeof less than three thousand metres. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Intriguing. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, run diagnostic on module L seven three. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I think you had better see this. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I do not believe you have the authority to promote me tothe rank of Admiral. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. <eos> <bos> DATA: Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in twenty sixseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Too late. My brother suggested that I try to developmy sense of humour. What do you think? <eos> <bos> DATA: The entities offer no indication that theyare aware of the string fragment, Captain. Their course and speedremain constant. <eos> <bos> DATA: My positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasicsignatures from the organisms, which were symbolically represented inmy dreams by a high shriek. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sleigh ride? <eos> <bos> DATA: In a sense. The time shift is a gearing system I have inventedfor the horseless carriage. <eos> <bos> DATA: What do you wish me to do, dear? Am I not paying enough attentionto you? <eos> <bos> DATA: I would like to get to know you better, Mother. <eos> <bos> DATA: Its size and composition match the probe which scanned theYamato, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android. <eos> <bos> DATA: The boy was listed as missing, presumed dead. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am preparing to initiate a static warp shell. <eos> <bos> DATA: Watson. Pray continue, Inspector. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least thirty seconds, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. <eos> <bos> DATA: Shh. We're getting out of here. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe is no longer transmitting. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is urgent that I speak to her. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severenavigational hazard towarp driven vessels. The Hekaras Corridor is the only route through thearea which is free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must usethe Corridor to ensure safe passage through the region. <eos> <bos> DATA: Counsellor, exactly how shall I proceed? <eos> <bos> DATA: He needs assembling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lestrade of course. <eos> <bos> DATA: She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian theology. It seems that Ardracame to Ventax Two and promised one thousand years of peace andprosperity, for a price. Upon her return, she would enslave the entirepopulation. In Ventaxian culture, it is considered bad luck to speakher name out loud. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps we should consider the transportersystem. It uses many of the same principles as the holodeck. Both, forexample, are capable of converting energy into matter. <eos> <bos> DATA: No response, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. While exploring astrange void in space without any form of matter or energy, we haveapparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it. After a briefdisruption, our ship's communications have returned to normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: No regrets. That is a human expression. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you examine your life, do you find you have missed yourhumanity? <eos> <bos> DATA: That may be impossible, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, we are picking up a faint distress signal on anopen subspace frequency. It appears to be coming from an adjacentsector. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer. Recognise Data, Lieutenant Commander. Alpha Oneclearance. <eos> <bos> DATA: Transmission from the planet surface, sir, Main viewer on. <eos> <bos> DATA: At some future date I will be transported back to nineteenthcentury Earth, where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have often wished to be human. I study people carefully inorder to more closely approximate human behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is Nuria the closest of the five? <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct. Key blue, amber, amber, red. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science,the beginning of wisdom, is I do not know. I do not know what that is, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear that the starship which Captain Picard attacked,had in fact, been under a flag of truce. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are badly damaged, sir. Their life support systems arefailing. <eos> <bos> DATA: The binary message left by the Captain is notentirely clear. He seemed to be concerned about the phase differentialof our photon torpedoes. That firing them might produce catastrophiceffects. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps the readings were correct. Their probe could have exitedthe wormhole at a completely different location. <eos> <bos> DATA: He seems most uncooperative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Can you override? <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: In the last three hours and eight minutes, Ihave spoken to fifty six colonists. Ten of those refused to believe athreat exists. Twenty two favour staying and fighting the Sheliak. Sixteen prefer negotiation or <eos> <bos> DATA: A former crewman was born here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir, in B'zal, a Ferengi code which uses an alternatingpattern of light and darkness. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading powerfluctuations on all decks. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is holding. Shearing force, eighty metric tons permetre. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have full confidence in your persuasive abilities. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will continue my experiment. I would like you to gather all thepieces of metal in the village and place them in this container. <eos> <bos> DATA: I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> DATA: This woodland pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because itduplicates Earth so well. Coming here almost makes me feel humanmyself. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The long range and infra-red sensors apparently suffered illeffects as a result of the wormhole. We are presently checking neutrinoand heavy particle detectors. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would appear that this container was constructed of a materialwhich absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Almost. It is being stored in shuttlebay two. Sir. JR <eos> <bos> DATA: It was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now. <eos> <bos> DATA: What did she train her cat to do? <eos> <bos> DATA: The metallurgical scan. Have you completed it? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have never had a nightmare. I do not require sleep. Timothy,are you having disturbing dreams? <eos> <bos> DATA: What happened? <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanning, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will require my hand. Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are out of the void, sir. You may stop auto-destruct. <eos> <bos> DATA: The enemy is firing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you for your concern. I will be fine. And thankyou, for everything. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spot? <eos> <bos> DATA: My timing is digital. What? <eos> <bos> DATA: Our mission is part of a highly coordinated effort to put an endto the war. There are other vessels on other fronts, all workingaccording to an intricate plan. <eos> <bos> DATA: Medical emergency. Doctor Pulaski to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Much of his file we could not retrieved. His name is L Q SonnyClemonds. Apparently his occupation had something to do with music. <eos> <bos> DATA: Excuse me. I have not yet congratulated Ensign Cheney. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am afraid his true destination remains a mystery. Readings nowindicate an open access panel in Jeffries tube N eleven, deck thirtyeight. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principledictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end upseveral days before the event or several days after. There is no way totell. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate damage to the Dorian's subspace emitter. Audiocommunication only. <eos> <bos> DATA: It could indicate the course of the Borg ship, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Transportation of colonists, diplomatic missions, emergencyevacuations. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe there is any way we can know for certain,Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is there something else you require of me, Captain? <eos> <bos> DATA: There is little information in the library computer other thanthe fact of its existence. Our sensor show no signs of life forms,virtually no vegetation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yet there are still no life form readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Intriguing. It is possible we could've caused the very anomalywe've been looking for. Let us assume for a moment that the Captain hasbeen travelling through time. Let us also assume he has initiated antachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three timeperiods. In that case, it is possible that the convergence of threetachyon pulses could've ruptured the subspace barrier and created ananti-time reaction. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit aroundthe planet. It reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds. <eos> <bos> DATA: The orders were given with great subtlety. To use an aphorism,Starfleet's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: We had practised the piece, and I noticed that she played it thesame way during the performance. Every pitch, every intonation, wasexactly the same. Only an artificial life form could have done that. <eos> <bos> DATA: The tractor beam originated somewhere in the Prytt Alliance. <eos> <bos> DATA: We can easily check the transporter ID traces. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Bortas has lost her port shields, sir. Itis unlikely they will withstand another hit at that quarter. Theirprimary life support has failed, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I must find a way to contact the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solarradiation and the metaphasic shield. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are currentlyimpaired, but I will run a full diagnostic to make certain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is what is written on the container. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room. <eos> <bos> DATA: The dips and peaks of the galaxy's magnetic field, organicmolecules in nebular clouds, energetic cosmic rays. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are moving into a course parallel to our own, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would be pleased to escort you around the ship. <eos> <bos> DATA: An artificial environment has been constructed on the southerncontinent, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Choo! <eos> <bos> DATA: In that circumstance, re-establishing control should be our toppriority. <eos> <bos> DATA: But I cannot take pride in my abilities. I cannot take pleasurein my accomplishments. <eos> <bos> DATA: The shuttle is emerging from the corona, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, if they activate <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the security lockout on Transporterroom six has been broken. <eos> <bos> DATA: This. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the Prime Minister is hailing us. Priority one. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is a synaptic map of the humanneo-cortex. This is a cross section of my positronic net. And this is aschematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believesome sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is stillrelatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless. <eos> <bos> DATA: The exocomp has replicated a different tool. That is not themolecular fuser it had when it entered the Jefferies tube. Doctor, theexocomp not only completed the repairs, it also deactivated theoverload signal. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot make the lock, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: To what are you referring? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is a most intriguing idea, sir. I do not believe a tachyonbeam was ever used in such a way. I had no idea you were so versed inthe intricacies of temporal theory, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: With my repository of knowledge, I expected to perform betteragainst a humanoid life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is why I have asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If Ican produce a high frequency interphasic pulse, it may have a similareffect on the creatures. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was on the Bridge at my station. <eos> <bos> DATA: That analogy is essentially correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain! <eos> <bos> DATA: A place? <eos> <bos> DATA: Not really, Inspector. And now, for strictly personal reasons, Imust leave. Come, Watson. This murder does not connect with our case. <eos> <bos> DATA: The structure must be here, yet we cannot see it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, they are initiating their transporter system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. It is wrong of you to force us. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fifteen thousand two hundred fifty three, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is idiotic. <eos> <bos> DATA: Are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother? <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter isdecaying more rapidly than predicted. It may not be possible to traceit. <eos> <bos> DATA: We unsuccessfully tried fifty three different computationalmodels in an effort to simulate the movements of the Nova Squadron justprior to the crash. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. <eos> <bos> DATA: One millisecondafter its detonation, thecomputer will trigger yourwarp jump. <eos> <bos> DATA: If it was a vision, I do not know how to proceed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently there was a micro-fracture in the conduit wall. Thefault did not register on our instruments. <eos> <bos> DATA: The metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used atheta-band subspace delivery system. Captain Picard is one of onlythree Starfleet Captains with extensive experience in theta-banddevices. The other two are no longer in Starfleet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I believe I have found the cause of the power surge. There is a warp core breach in progress. <eos> <bos> DATA: A comparison modern scholars have drawn from Earth history likensthe Ferengi to the ocean-going Yankee traders of eighteenth andnineteenth century America, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Desire? To long for, to crave, a wish, a request, a <eos> <bos> DATA: You may have inadvertently given Professor Moriarty the means ofgaining control of the real Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However,there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possiblesomething is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run acomplete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at thebiometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to takeover my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week. Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this. <eos> <bos> DATA: A friend. <eos> <bos> DATA: Did whut? <eos> <bos> DATA: That is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than ourown warp drive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I believe I have found an obscure precedent in Ventaxian lawwhich may be of interest. <eos> <bos> DATA: The land contours are familiar, sir. Topographically, this is thecorrect area. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am unable to penetrate defence systemscommand structure <eos> <bos> DATA: We have created a small conduit breach in this tube. The exocompwould normally require several minutes to complete a repair of thistype. Once it enters the tube, it will find that a plasma cascadefailure is in progress. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am an android, not a robot. Q <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations, Captain. Mostunusual ones. <eos> <bos> DATA: Energy reserves are dropping rapidly, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe is composed of paricium and talgonite, a ceramic alloy. <eos> <bos> DATA: The foremost authority in cybernetics. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her beliefs should be reflected as well. However their death rituals are quite complicated. RO <eos> <bos> DATA: Life support systems are also functioning at low levels. Thereare approximately four hundred fifty Ferengi on board. That is astandard complement for a ship of that class. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have located the Phoenix, sir. We will intercept it intwenty two minutes. Captain's log, stardate 44431.7. We haveestablished communication with Captain Maxwell, and he has agreed tocome on board. <eos> <bos> DATA: Warp six point three seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Lieutenant, I am curious about something. If you met a double ofyourself, would you have difficulty interacting with him? <eos> <bos> DATA: Six seconds to impact. <eos> <bos> DATA: I sincerely hope so. <eos> <bos> DATA: The vessel is entering a low orbit around Rana Four. It appearsit is preparing to fire at the planet, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was processing all of the information we have accumulated onRomulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am programmed with the procedures you mention, sir. And in anymeaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis ofcomparison. I am the only model available, Admiral. <eos> <bos> DATA: Approaching Nelvana system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. Our understanding of Romulan technology is stilllimited. <eos> <bos> DATA: The last Federation vessel to make contact was the Potemkin, sixyears ago. They were warned that anyone transporting down to the colonywould be killed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time. Butthis would have to be done in the other two time periods as well. <eos> <bos> DATA: Incidentally, Captain, the effects of the time distortions arenow being felt in the Ilecom system. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why, Doctor? It is done, and perhaps just as well. This hasindicated that I am damaged in some fashion. I must find themalfunction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Come in, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The product continues to upgrade and improve. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no technology to block telepathic transmissions, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Probable cause? <eos> <bos> DATA: Ah, a word that ends in K. So, if you put funny teeth in yourmouth and jump around like an idiot, that is considered funny. <eos> <bos> DATA: The transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around thefourth planet in the system. However, the receiving station is on thethird planet. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, this appears to be the master subsurface pump. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not believe so, sir. That would not be consistent with thedebris pattern. However, sensors indicate extremely high levels ofresidual antiprotons. <eos> <bos> DATA: The plasma venting system has engaged. <eos> <bos> DATA: Comedy stressing farce and horseplay. Ah. This, no doubt, is avariation on pie in the face? <eos> <bos> DATA: I neither liked it nor disliked it. I simply had no appetite. <eos> <bos> DATA: The initial dispersal pattern should not bemore than seven kilometres in diameter. Jenna? <eos> <bos> DATA: Precisely. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. The Romulans have released a high energy burst. The net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometresaround the Sutherland. <eos> <bos> DATA: Proverbial lemon? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is an order. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were a bit rude to me. Might make you feel better if you saidyou were sorry. <eos> <bos> DATA: He is the commanding officer of the Cairo. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering withbioreadings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Tractor beam is holding. <eos> <bos> DATA: An android alarm clock. Is that amusing? They time how long Iremain unconscious. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to these records, there were no survivors. TheTralestas were annihilated. <eos> <bos> DATA: But this vessel? And the temporal distortion that coincided withyour arrival? <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, it is good to see you. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has a follicle, sir. Live cells. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently, he did not survive. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know, and that is what puzzles me. <eos> <bos> DATA: Computer, identify type of radiation. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are six life forms aboard the freighter, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The genetic information must have been incorporated into theearliest lifeforms on these planets, and then passed down through eachgeneration. <eos> <bos> DATA: Adjust the invert two percent negative. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, the Legarans are ready to beamaboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am nearly finished compiling readings from our most recentilluminatory burst. Dark matter density is nearly one order ofmagnitude higher than in similar nebulae. Life forms here may havedeveloped in ways never before observed. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I observed that you seem to have an aversion toorderliness. But it was not intended as a humourous remark. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, butboth are alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Hardly, sir. I believe this analogy refers to the worst qualityof capitalists. The Ferengi are believed to conduct their affairs ofcommerce on the ancient principle caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware. <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps something occurred during transport, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are no human life signs. <eos> <bos> DATA: These people have been fighting all of their lives. They knowonly hatred, suspicion, and fear. Even with myChorus, I could not have changed their attitudes in a day. We have achance. They want the talks to be successful. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beingsdoes diminish proportionately with the deprivation of nutritious fuelor <eos> <bos> DATA: We have only a few minutes before our next meeting, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: The case involves a contract dispute over services rendered by aKlingon craftsman on the construction of a Ventaxian home. Because thedispute involved an alien culture, the parties decided that arbitrationrather than the courts, should resolve the issue. Both sides agreed tochoose an arbiter. It is the only known case involving an alienclaimant. <eos> <bos> DATA: All systems are functioning within normal specifications, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Step away from the forcefield. Your proximity is interfering withmy scan. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not entirely correct. While it is true the display iscurrently blank, this emptiness has a poetic meaning. Therefore itcannot be considered nothing as such. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is reading incredible amounts of energy, sir. Even more sincewe have taken down the shield. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a possibility, Captain. If that hypothesis is correct, thephenomenon we justencountered would be a temporal rift in space. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will attempt to narrow the field, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Bring us around to the back side of the asteroid, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have found them to be quite unsettling. <eos> <bos> DATA: Make it so. <eos> <bos> DATA: I question your sincerity, Lore. <eos> <bos> DATA: Viewscreen on. Focus on area. Magnification factor ten. Increasemagnification to fifty. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have scanned the entire ship, Captain. Other than theEnterprise's regular complement, I can find no one else onboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Jack. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unfortunately, yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is highly improbable. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, my Chorus was special. They allowed me to combine differentperceptions. <eos> <bos> DATA: I do not know. I will have to analyse these readings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then the conductor then signalled for the train to changedirections, and at approximately the same time <eos> <bos> DATA: Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am comingto the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct. <eos> <bos> DATA: There is no indication of life. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Lantree is a Class Six Federation supply ship assigned toGamma seven sector, Captain L. I. Telaka commanding. Normal complement,twenty six officers and crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand. You are in competition with Mister Kaplan. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot identify the energy residual. However, it appears tohave the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observedfrom the weather control system. <eos> <bos> DATA: I was not aware he created other androids before my brother. <eos> <bos> DATA: If you are referring to the illness, you are partially correct. However, it is more complex than that. The metal fragment which <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way, it mayalleviated the guilt. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible that Geordi upset their timetable when he saw thehidden weapons. <eos> <bos> DATA: I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weatherpatterns. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the ship is not at the pre-arrangedcoordinates. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sorry, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, as we move deeper into the nebula,sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trionium are continuingto rise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Open, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It may be possible, sir, but it would not be advisable. <eos> <bos> DATA: The starboard bulkhead of main Engineering is contained withinthe rock face, but most of its compartment is still intact. <eos> <bos> DATA: No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then my work with him is done. <eos> <bos> DATA: Because I am a machine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Does that mean you no longer believe this is the real Kahless? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have noticed, Grandpa, that you keep repeating the same notesof a musical phrase I am unfamiliar with. <eos> <bos> DATA: Goodbye, Father. Captain's log, Stardate 44091.1. We have been atStarbase four one six for three days. Young Willie Potts is respondingwell to treatment and has been returned to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, your message said urgent. <eos> <bos> DATA: Apparently there were no starships available on Starbase One FiveThree. The envoy is aboard a class eight probe. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Crusher and I discovered that the exocomp did not fail thetest. It is still my belief we are dealing with a new life form. <eos> <bos> DATA: Anger is a negative emotion. I wanted to concentrate on somethingmore positive. <eos> <bos> DATA: The only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption intheir movement pattern during our last attempt to break away. <eos> <bos> DATA: I require your advice. I have come to an impasse regarding myrecent unexplained experience. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Look, Sarjenka, there is your home. <eos> <bos> DATA: An intriguing experiment. The capsule might provide us withinformation without the need to decode the storage medium itself. Perhaps we should examine your theory immediately. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will reach the class M planet in approximately eleven hours,sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The structure is rhizomatous. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot say. <eos> <bos> DATA: We know the Edo share them, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, please do not think this is an arbitrary decision. Ihave considered the ramifications of my actions carefully, and I do notbelieve it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another. <eos> <bos> DATA: Agreed. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I understand. You are concerned about unintentionallyhurting Ensign Tyler's feelings. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: You were knocked unconscious by the fall. You broke a bone inyour arm, but Doctor Crusher repaired it. Everything is fine. Captain's log, supplemental. The infusion of plasmainto the core of Atrea Four has been accomplished. The core shouldremain molten for several hundred years. <eos> <bos> DATA: The system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless theshield emitter is active. Any attempt to sabotage the device would haveto be made while the shield was in operation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Matter-antimatter explosions appear to be ineffective, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them. <eos> <bos> DATA: And what is the significance of the anniversary of this event? <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you wish a frank evaluation? It lacks the harmony thatcharacterised this particular temple and Dokkaran culture in general. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, there is a celebration on the Holodeck. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That should not be possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is my name. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you. Thank me? Ah! <eos> <bos> DATA: Fascinating. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have been unable to contact Sarjenka. <eos> <bos> DATA: It has been over an hour since we heard the Entity, sir. It maybe gone. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Power loss now at twelve percent, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: As you wish. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am attempting to do so. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then it is alright for you to die, because I will remain alive. You know that I cannot grieve for you, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am trained in evasive manoeuvres. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Admiral. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, it is conceivable, even for me, that time will eventuallylead to irreparable circuit failure. But there is one thing I do notunderstand. Sarek is a logical, intelligent being. The effects ofBendii Syndrome are apparent. Why would such a man choose to ignorethem? <eos> <bos> DATA: We may not have to. Direct your view to the far corner, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: That was the first clue, Watson. The vial contained strychnine,which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms. It is difficultto imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could haveheld on to so delicate a container without shattering it. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe we can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes areactually energy collectors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yet there are numerous examples where it was successful. Theindependence of the Mexican State from Spain, the Irish Unification of2024, and the Kensey Rebellion. <eos> <bos> DATA: My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I now have the antimatter and am moving towards theopening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occurwithin seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. 3 <eos> <bos> DATA: At the rate the levels are decreasing, we will gain entry inforty nine hours, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: I cannot answer that. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: If I interpret your facial expressions correctly, you arepreoccupied with something unpleasant. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, the probe's energy output is overloading our shields. Failure anticipated in forty seven seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: Something is happening. A new subspacebarrier appears to be forming, <eos> <bos> DATA: The shuttle's acceleration is increasing. Its trajectory ismoving directly into the planet's atmosphere. He will reach anatmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planet'scrust. There is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat. <eos> <bos> DATA: Correct, sir. We are no doubt advanced in some areas, they inothers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Doctor Pulaski is unwilling to trust the turbolifts. She issending medical teams through the access tunnels. <eos> <bos> DATA: Three. All threes. <eos> <bos> DATA: She is correct, sir. I am detecting large amounts of ultritium. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I find it highly unlikely that Danar would be attempting toreach shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> DATA: You must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasicpulse. <eos> <bos> DATA: My entity's artificial substructure may be useful. <eos> <bos> DATA: Why that razor, my friend? Why not the one I adjusted to perfectefficiency? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have no feelings of any kind. <eos> <bos> DATA: Scanners shows limited armaments. <eos> <bos> DATA: Welcome back, Geordi. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, you are needed on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> DATA: Spindle, a thin rounded tapering rod <eos> <bos> DATA: This has been an interesting encounter, and an altogetherunexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before weproceed further. Excuse me, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Is it the mercenary ship? <eos> <bos> DATA: In spite of the fact that I am an android? <eos> <bos> DATA: I have consulted numerous animal training manuals. Some of themclaim that cats are inherently untrainable. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nucleosynthesis. The structure of the glasshas been altered at the atomic level. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is possible. <eos> <bos> DATA: Gladly accepted, sir. As for Lore's abilities, his use of syntaxand grammar suggests he was given human memories similar to my own. <eos> <bos> DATA: The databanks that identify who I am are not functioning. <eos> <bos> DATA: Noranium alloy, sir. It's salvage value is quite low. <eos> <bos> DATA: Considering the absence of debris, Captain,it is reasonable to assume the Klingon vessel is in the area andcloaked. <eos> <bos> DATA: Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. <eos> <bos> DATA: The compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing andstorage capacity. <eos> <bos> DATA: What is the subject? <eos> <bos> DATA: It registers as solid, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are down there, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten. <eos> <bos> DATA: Of course you do. <eos> <bos> DATA: That one was not created by the archive, sir. That is the claymask I originally made. I have since painted it. <eos> <bos> DATA: However, two hours later, when it was aboard the Enterprise andno longer in danger, it repaired itself. I believe the exocomp wasprotecting itself. And if that is true, it has demonstrated anawareness of its environment, and an ability to adapt to thatenvironment. <eos> <bos> DATA: Adjusting the synchronic distortion. Point zero zero one. Pointzero zero two. Point zero zero three. Point zero zero four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, long range sensors indicate another vessel approachingthis area. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe I recognise these symbols. <eos> <bos> DATA: Does this waveform match that of any known communication format? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, much of my bodyframe is made up of tripolymers, a nonconductive material. <eos> <bos> DATA: And what about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. I amconsidered to be alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: I know of no such logs. <eos> <bos> DATA: The Lantree logs indicated that only one crewman had any illnessprior to arrival here. The First Officer had a mild case of Thelusianflu. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is in direct physical contact with our shields. <eos> <bos> DATA: Describe, please. <eos> <bos> DATA: A mode stabiliser. <eos> <bos> DATA: Howdy, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: Transient response is normal. <eos> <bos> DATA: Integrity-field pressure has increased by two hundred seventeenpercent, Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Second neural connection is confirmed. Istill cannot report any significant access. Proceeding with the finallink. <eos> <bos> DATA: We will use extreme caution. <eos> <bos> DATA: They are a relatively benign species. <eos> <bos> DATA: Nothing on the sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will scan their warp signatures. Sir, sensors indicate theattacking vessels are Federation ships. RO <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate that the shield iselectromagnetic, a complicated light refracting mechanism. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are correct. I did not anticipate your arrival until nineteenhundred hours. <eos> <bos> DATA: There are many things of importance. Some more than others. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually sir, that may be an incorrect analogy. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Riker, report to the Captain's quarters. <eos> <bos> DATA: They will scan the debris and discover I was not aboard. <eos> <bos> DATA: No. In actuality, less than one percent of the Enterprise crewwas involved. It was necessary to balance theory withexperiential referents. Both are required for a programme of thisnature. Computer, decrease illumination level by one third standardlux. <eos> <bos> DATA: Then you are not an historian. <eos> <bos> DATA: Negative. I detect no reduction in the lifeform's rate of energy consumption. <eos> <bos> DATA: Not illusion, Lieutenant. They do exist, but they do not registeras either man or machine. <eos> <bos> DATA: Holding. <eos> <bos> DATA: The microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy. Thebiofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is not so. <eos> <bos> DATA: Geordi, the atmosphere becomes increasinglyturbulent the farther down you go. You may not be able to bring theRaman close enough to the Hera before being destroyed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness. Shehas cancelled the wedding. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sensors indicate no other ships within three light years. <eos> <bos> DATA: Drop your shields and prepare to beboarded. <eos> <bos> DATA: Incidentally, Captain, the effects of the time distortions arenow being felt in the Ilecom system. <eos> <bos> DATA: I will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment Ineed to research your father's illness. <eos> <bos> DATA: I can easily furnish the nanites with a schematic design of myneurological structure. Entering my neural network would require nomore than their most basic skills. <eos> <bos> DATA: You misunderstand. Counsellor Troi is a therapist. <eos> <bos> DATA: Be a good fellow and answer that. Let's not keep the Inspectorwaiting. <eos> <bos> DATA: Eleven point seven five, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the answer to both questions is no, sir. In a manner ofspeaking, it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock, a useless ball ofmud, a worthless chunk <eos> <bos> DATA: And the Berlin can safely withstand aRomulan attack, and deducted our time to destination at maximum warpspeed. That leaves Doctor Crusher forty eight minutes to develop aninoculants to the virus. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are in position, Doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Actually, six is a valid point. Of course, now the objective isto roll a duplicate six before hitting seven. <eos> <bos> DATA: Uncertain. I have no unusual readings, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is me. I am here. I am alive. <eos> <bos> DATA: With intelligence, there is the capability of language, but itwill depend on how far their evolution has brought them. We couldmodify the circuitry in the universal translator to make it capable ofcommunications with them. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe the maximum saturation level shouldbe eighteen point three percent. <eos> <bos> DATA: I'm detecting a chroniton field in your room. May I scan thearea? <eos> <bos> DATA: Your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Blue, blue, blue. <eos> <bos> DATA: She only wanted to get to Troi and Lieutenant Prieto. <eos> <bos> DATA: At least an hour, but I do not believe much time can be saved byexhibiting such haste now. <eos> <bos> DATA: May I see it? This is one of the metal fragments I sold toSkoran. <eos> <bos> DATA: It would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself. Onceinside, we may be able to use the engines to create a static warpshell. <eos> <bos> DATA: There have been reports of warp bubbles and other subspacedeformations. <eos> <bos> DATA: You are in need of medical attention. I will get a doctor. <eos> <bos> DATA: Unknown, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: They pose no danger to humans. However, some of the ship'ssystems may be affected by prolonged exposure. When I return I willdevise a method to eradicate them. <eos> <bos> DATA: Since we have only experienced the phenomenon once, it isimpossible to estimate the risks. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by sevenpercent, and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have begun training her. <eos> <bos> DATA: We are still receiving their signal, Captain, but there is nomessage. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have completed modifications, Commander. <eos> <bos> DATA: None, sir. This has never been seen before. <eos> <bos> DATA: Think back. Are you sure that was the very first change? <eos> <bos> DATA: These are the most unusual humans I have ever encountered. <eos> <bos> DATA: Initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which thedistress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. <eos> <bos> DATA: Rogue? Ah. Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain, wild element. <eos> <bos> DATA: Termination of all life support in fiveseconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: No, sir. Ionic interference is too heavy. <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, but I have no form of legal tender. <eos> <bos> DATA: I suspect they travelled through the transporter beam. That mayhave been the cause of Geordi and Ro's death. I will go to the Romulan ship. Perhaps I can discover the source of theemissions. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: With impulse engines operating at sixty percent power, it willtake one minute and forty seconds. <eos> <bos> DATA: And are located near the system J twofive. <eos> <bos> DATA: Begin night watch. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. We have both been programmed. <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander, I believe I can recalibrate our sensors to readthrough the electromagnetic interference over the poles. <eos> <bos> DATA: You called me Data. <eos> <bos> DATA: Thank you, Lieutenant. The crowd seemed a bit too ebullient forcomfort. Perhaps you would enjoy a quiet visit to the arboretum. <eos> <bos> DATA: I fail to recall how I arrived here. <eos> <bos> DATA: Enterprise to USS Yamato. Respond, please. USS Enterprisecalling USS Yamato. Respond, please, on this frequency. No response,Captain. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, this holographic image differs from any I have everseen. Could he have actually injured you? <eos> <bos> DATA: Do not apologise, Doctor. I believe we have discovered somethingsignificant. <eos> <bos> DATA: The only sites not been attacked were on Calder Two, YadallaPrime, and Draken Four. <eos> <bos> DATA: Turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters. <eos> <bos> DATA: Power conduits are ready. Is something wrong, Doctor? <eos> <bos> DATA: Perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget theunpleasant ones? <eos> <bos> DATA: May I ask a question? <eos> <bos> DATA: Everything available on a Doctor Noonien Soong. <eos> <bos> DATA: My thoughts are not for Tasha, but for myself. I keep thinkinghow empty it will feel without her presence. Did I miss the point? <eos> <bos> DATA: What kind of cake are you eating? <eos> <bos> DATA: I am sorry, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> DATA: According to the rate of reproduction, there should be a twelvecentimetre opening in the Klingon hull at this time. <eos> <bos> DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together, we willdestroy the Federation. And now, the conclusion. <eos> <bos> DATA: There it is again. An area of blackness. <eos> <bos> DATA: This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore, by anyaccepted standard, it does not exist, yet being within it denies thatconclusion. <eos> <bos> DATA: Blackjack. Accessing. Ah. Also known as twenty one, a numberwhich defines the object of the game. Picture cards are worth ten, acesone or eleven, all other cards face value. <eos> <bos> DATA: At the last moment, I speculated that three might refer to thenumber of rank insignia on Commander Riker's uniform. That indicated to me that his suggestion might be the correct course ofaction. <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create anaccurate simulation. <eos> <bos> DATA: It provides tactile sensations so that Geordi can feel he's inthe same environment as the probe. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have followed all of Starfleet regulations to the best of myability. I expected they would be pleased. <eos> <bos> DATA: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: The probe does allow Geordi to sense quantum fluctuations,subspace anomalies, and other phenomenon not perceptible by any otherkind of sensors. <eos> <bos> DATA: Keiko, I need your help. I have offended youand need to find a way to rectify my mistake. I am not sure what to do. <eos> <bos> DATA: Certainly. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is you who are not real, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a formidable responsibility. <eos> <bos> DATA: They're within transporter range, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Ardra is right. If I am chosen, I will perform my duties withoutbias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee I will deliver a verdict in yourfavour. <eos> <bos> DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have expended considerable thought with respect to my apparentuniqueness among the crew. <eos> <bos> DATA: She will? <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has stabilised. They appear to haveimpulse capability. <eos> <bos> DATA: We have reached the centre, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, incoming message from DaiMon Birta. <eos> <bos> DATA: Two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees. Of course, noraniumcarbide <eos> <bos> DATA: Sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: Commander Maddox, I noted that Keiko was quite calm andrational when she informed me of her decision this morning. Therefore,I can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of thesituation based on the available facts. It is fortunate that she hasnot let emotional considerations cloud her judgement. It should make mytask much simpler. <eos> <bos> DATA: Do you think the others will think this service appropriate? <eos> <bos> DATA: He's on ice. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes, sir. However, the difference in intensity indicates thatthis one did not originate from the same location as the first. <eos> <bos> DATA: Fortunately, Starfleet has no such rulesinvolving our second officers. <eos> <bos> DATA: Yes. Then I will take you to the corridor. We will transport backto the Enterprise from there. Do you understand? <eos> <bos> DATA: Emotion, sir? <eos> <bos> DATA: She is responsible for the death of a Cardassian soldier. <eos> <bos> DATA: That is the correct log. However, no information <eos> <bos> DATA: I am ready to access the main power grid. <eos> <bos> DATA: I would ask you to consider the possibility that what you see isnot real. <eos> <bos> DATA: Data here. <eos> <bos> DATA: His molecular structure is destabilising. <eos> <bos> DATA: I have maintained records on positronic matrix activity,behavioral norms, and all verbal patterns. I have seen no evidence ofother aberrations. <eos> <bos> DATA: Precisely, sir. <eos> <bos> DATA: Joking? Ah. Forced to endure Risa. Your actual intent was toemphasise that you did enjoy yourself. Yes, I see how that could beconsidered quite amusing. <eos> <bos> DATA: I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying objects andphenomena according to superficial observation rather than empiricalevidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire simply because it iscombustible, nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood,like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of differentchemical compounds, none of which is fire. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a highly structured society in which people live by strictcodes of honour. For example, what Lutan did is similar to what certainAmerican Indians once did called counting coup. That's from an obscurelanguage called French. Counting coup <eos> <bos> DATA: Captain, I'm reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptiveprominences, sir. The magnetic field is extremely irregular. <eos> <bos> DATA: It is a piece of history. The opportunity to examine such anancient vehicle does not come around very often, and as you pointedout, we do have the time. <eos> <bos> DATA: This is not a computer simulation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does her husband know anything about this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no record of the Romulans ever assaulting the EnterpriseC. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is primarily a diplomatic mission. The Jaradan arestrategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts havefailed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in thepronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty year rift. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about beingon a starship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Friendly, isn't she? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not worried about Tin Man. It's more Romulans showing up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, we've got one, waiting to beam aboard complete withorders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And deadly. The last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem. Now there's nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll start tomorrow morning, oh eight hundred hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I never thought I'd see you again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were lucky. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the file. It'll work now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For all we know, the Ambassador might enjoy an evening'sentertainment <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll alert the crew. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you stay and talk? I wanted to remember our last nighttogether. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, lock on the tractor beam. Transporter Chief, prepare tohim beam aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where's that sonic driver? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Please let me touch you, just for a moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what was Geordi repairing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's the time allotted that concerns me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's it? What's the emergency? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computergenerated fantasy I once experienced on another holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even for your newly improved phasers? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter Room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The portable transporter array is in. Whenwe get into null space, we'll need to initialise it before we cantransport the J'naii crew to this shuttle. But there should still beenough power left to beam all of us back to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not now, Remmick. He's going to take this out, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, that's starting to come back to me. There was no proofincluded. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. But win, all right? The pride of the Enterprise goes withyou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Ensign, if you encounter any holes, steer clear. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

The Engineeringqualification's one of the toughest parts of the test. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All hands, battle stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just like the Ferengi ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up. You can't tow us. You'd better beam us directly on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Temporal disturbance? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to La Forge. Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make every effort, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is it? I can't see it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A bizarre incident just took place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds like our Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Some kind of corrosion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Er, Will, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what is taking so long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Doctor Timicin. You have a visitor coming aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, First Officer of the USSEnterprise. You have a lot to learn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not Minuet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's going to be quite a ride. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold it! I gave you an order, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you even brought provisions. Very thoughtful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that all? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Classified? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tactical analysis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I say we turn him over to them. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: The away team's ready, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All decks, security alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it's any comfort, we're all in the same situation, so stayput for now. We'll be back in touch. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have no recollection of her at all. What was she like? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't just sit here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors have discovered a small one-man spaceship crashed on theplanet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what boarded the station could have been an organism thatlooked and acted like Lieutenant Rocha? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Every single time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A rare and valuable object? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Guinan, if they were that aggressive, why didn't the Borgattack? They could have but they didn't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, not at all. Have a seat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open fire, all weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've guided his training, sir, I'm the one at fault. You willshow the proper respect. I will accompany you down there to makecertain of it. With your approval, of course, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure we won't. Energise.  SCHOLAR <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the First Officer, sir. If you prepare to shut down yourengines, we can lock on the tractor and beam you over here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yuta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With an offer of amnesty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring us to within ten thousandkilometres and hold us there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge. Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As ordered. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was a first contact situation. Ghorusdan culture is socomplex and different, that the Federation sent a specialist to preventmisunderstanding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll call you the next time I pass through your star system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stars whose planets are their defence system? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare for impact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The scattering field is still in full force. What the hell iswrong with them? Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ourscan. Riker to O'Brien. Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's a shuttlecraft doing out this far? Where's its mothership? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Heading for home. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the nature of this trade? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right then, we'll stand. The important thing is that westart talking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hugh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tension is hardly the word I'd use. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No sign of a temporal distortion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How will you get them across the border? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They won't back off. They've been willing to fight to the deathin past encounters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are taking the survivors to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would prefer to find a peaceful solution. If we could talk ourway out of this one, that much the better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wes, responsibility and authority go hand in hand. I know you'reresponsible, now we've got to teach you a little bit of authority. Oneof the reasons you've been given command is so you can make a few rightdecisions, that will establish a pattern of success and help buildself-confidence. If you don't trust your own judgment, you don't belongin the command chair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. Data, separate yourself from Captain Picard. Away Team, get yourselves home. Mister Crusher, upon their return moveus to a safe position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said you knew she was an android. How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually it was quite a bargain, Kazago. I thought the Ferengialways made a profit on things. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Lin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn it, no. I can't afford to get this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Granted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just one, sir. We could go down there and have a look. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Without them we would never mature into adults. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Begin firing sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that Melor Famagal I hear? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a Ventaxian leader on the viewscreen, name of AcostJared. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Got it. The Artemis. Launched ninety twoyears ago. Destination Septimus Minor. When they failed to check in,Starfleet began an extensive search. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When was it detected? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is insubordination, Mister Barclay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Might we have moved into another dimension? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This planet's interior heat provides anabundance of geothermal energy, sir. But it's about all this world doesoffer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Kolrami's right. You've got to save theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I feel terrible. But thanks to you, I'm doing much better now. And I'm confident that when I leave, I will be ready to take my placein society again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, not by name, but the Federation. They know the Federationwill send their best. That'll give them a perfect chance to seefirsthand how far we've advanced both in technology and technique. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, how much more can we get out of that tractorbeam? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be very comfortable, thank you. Good night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Imperative? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you drop a hammer on your foot, it's hardly useful to get madat the hammer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've gotten word from the monitoring stations. They're allonline. We're ready when you are, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've been observing the planet very carefully for three hours. We've seen nothing. I have the feeling you're waiting for something tohappen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign ofany Borg, or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, there's a very sick little boy onboard theEnterprise who's not getting any better. We're dead in the water untilyou get us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm not interrupting. RO + <eos> <bos> RIKER: I prefer brains over brawn as well. I think it's a waste ofeffort to test our combat skills. It's a minor province in the make-upof a starship captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have only seventeen minutes of warppower left. Do whatever you can to get them out of warp. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not yet. We don't know how long it'll stay that way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: See if you can increase the oxygen level. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's only used for defence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we do it, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when the engineer tried to protect us, one of the charactersshot him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pull yourself together. Worf! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can't you think of some excuse to get out of it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. Just a little numb, that's all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher tells me that in order to inflict the kind ofmolecular damage found in Rocha's remains, it would take a sustainedphaser discharge of at least thirty to forty seconds. That doesn'tsound like self-defence to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your memories are gone as well? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't contact the Captain. It could justbe interference, but I'd like to be sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I sent Worf to check the weapons locker on the relay station. There's a phaser missing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Full boat, kings over. I'd like to thank you both for your verygenerous contributions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've tied into your computers, if you'd like to access thefiles. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Engineering, respond. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what thisstuff is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, you just asked me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're having difficulties withour communications. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From what I could see, the Ambassador doesn't need to beprotected from anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We think so. The shuttle probably wasn't able to sustain itsenergy, but other than that it wouldn't be damaged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: ETA? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fifty three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. I think you'dbetter come out here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I knew I could count on my Imzadi, the ship's Counsellor toboost my self-image. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible. You cheated me. How'd you get away with it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wish I could tell you about him. We think he may be heldinside the compound. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coolant leak! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set course to intercept. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She says he's too ill to make the trip. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Powerful enough. We came to talk! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Contact Starfleet, request all logs of the Intrepid. Riker toDoctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look at them. They're certainly not Jarada or Romulans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We just ran a full test of those systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors. If youand Geordi are through down there, we'd like to have you on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I intend to demand the highest level of performance from her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't see it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, the unexpected is our normal routine. Hold it steady,Wesley. Ready to link up on my command <eos> <bos> RIKER: She was part of a very special programme. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm serious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll just have to do the best we can without you. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was there, in Ward forty seven, just like in the play. Everyone thought that I was insane, that I'd actually killed someone. But it was all real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we have no facts. We have to assume theexplosion was an accident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready to beam out. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I don't understand what he's going to do. How can hemediate without his interpreters? He won't even be able to talk tothem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, you might be right, but I'd like to give the crash site aonce over first. Maintain our current orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lost sheep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Freeze programme. Then I returned to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ask them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My God. They're delivering more of them for the others toingest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Just for the moment lets say that you're right. Whatdo we do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right then, you talk to me. Where are my officers? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What part of me does he represent? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But he wouldn't listen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vacuum preserved everything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're not going to wait around. Let's find the rest of our team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bynars seem perfect for this. Eventhough this is the first time I've ever come in contact with them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have visual contact. I don't recognise it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering to Bridge, we're ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Friend? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're receiving an emergency distress signalfrom the Solarion Four colony. <eos> <bos> RIKER: None the worse for wear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, but we're finished here. Now, I can allow time foryou and Kevin to pack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've discovered the second lab is on the far side of theplanet, completely destroyed. Unable to determine what caused it. Otherwise, very little to clarify the situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. They'll be pleased that. Can you explain now what hewas after? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's an excuse. What you really mean is it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife. Watch you stab it into your heart, then pull the knife from your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve. That's the rite of death, isn't it? Well, I'm sorry, Mister Worf. I can't help you. There's only one person on this ship who can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've heard of the simulation aboard the Hathaway? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Success. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we can find them. We've arranged for quarters on the ship,if you'd like to stay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Circa 1958. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Lenarians attacked us outside of the conference room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. Take us to the battlecoordinates, Mister Crusher. Yellow alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Course laid in for Durenia Four, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've just picked up a distress call from aFerengi shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, why don't you take a look at the doctor'sexperimental data. Later, you can give me an overview. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean we could have come into this room, sat at this tableand had this conversation a dozen times already? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell is he up to? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautifulsight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our Chief Engineer is working on ways to reinforce our tractorbeam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why am I here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, if what you say is true, where am I? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? At Nelvana three, he threatened to take thehull of the Enterprise home as a war trophy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't be frightened. There is no way I could harm any of you. Shall I guess your dreams? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I shunted the database to the main core underneath thestation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That means Uhnari is a coalescent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That isn't necessary. The ship will clean itself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three days, no transporters. We'll never get them out in time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Job? Which job? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any of them inhabited? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the Ambassador? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will we be holding position here until it arrives? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, I haven't remembered a day for the last sixteen years. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase to warp six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Captain. You're wanted in the lounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I must. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've practised my best Academy courtesy, nowit's time for you to go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But it hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or by me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Spock? <eos> <bos> RIKER: End simulation sequence. Secure from drill. Alpha shift, yourresponse time was seven percent slower than the gamma shift. Alldepartments, submit drill evaluation reportsRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well. right now I think you should be in Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, it's better than music, it's jazz. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set a standard orbit. Any evidence of a mining expedition? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room five. I'm still a littleuncomfortable with your leading this away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They never seem to work for me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The way Mendrossen described him, I expectedto see a frail old man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It just sort of rolled in on us, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll get right on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have to find a way to reach him. We must know what he knows <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starfleet is stretched pretty thin acrossthe quadrant. There are only about twelve ships within a day's travelof this position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That can't be native to the planet. The Boraalans don't haveanything close to that level of technology. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the probe is through the airlockand in position aboard the Raman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Love to play, but not with these cards. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was just assigned here this morning. I was working downtown. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, my friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even Klingons need love now and then. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't even see it coming. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Travel time to the nearest starbase? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's not much to look at. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: From what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She never said anything to you about being pregnant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything we've seen would indicate otherwise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see it. Life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly thinks its going to be tight. Let'shope he didn't take us too far off course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I felt no collision. Were we hit by a small meteor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reprogramming them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had it. Let's put all this technology to work, figure outwhat's going on, and get the hell out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable incrowded rooms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're clear of the strands. We'll have full warp capability intwenty minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Check with the Enterprise, see what's available. Be sure yourconcern are addressed before we install it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien do you have the Captain's signal? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's taking a sabbatical. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status, Ensign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It would still get us. It would just take a little longer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. But you can't make someone love you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's try that again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ah, that's going to be a little difficult right at the moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what if we forced an discharge through the impulsereactor. Would that be enough to get us out of here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which one is the closest one to the debris coordinates? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The unknown vessel has been destroyed. The Uxbridges have beendestroyed. There's no reason for the Enterprise to remain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible. It's planned month by month, decade by decade? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did this ever get started? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell me what this is all about. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who reported to the Bridge from this group? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unusual in what way? Specify? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, everyone in this roomshares my respect for your service to this ship. But right now, I needyour experience at tactical. Commander Data, I realise your very natureomits ambition. Nevertheless, I want you to know I seriously consideredyou first officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Request permission for Ensign Crusher to reboardthe Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you alright? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Explain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I. Yes. I don't know <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess I'd start looking for a new career. There must be aplace where someone with fifteen years of Starfleet technical knowledgewould be useful. You wouldn't happen to know a place like that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Barclay! <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the gamma ray scanner? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard. If you'll follow me I will show you theaccommodations that we've <eos> <bos> RIKER: Request flight clearance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were in this sector on another mission, and since you hadalready contacted Starfleet about additional dicosilium, it seemed likea good opportunity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage mooring beams and lock off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Back so soon, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did you like command? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think I should have assigned a security team to keep aneye on our guests? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Easier? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That sounds like that'll use up a lot of warp energy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This time I want someone with you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What for? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I might, if we weren't on our way to help some suffering anddying humans who Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gaps? From what I saw, I find that hard to believe. Yourecreated the Enterprise, the crew, every nuance and smell, sound, withperfect accurate. I didn't see any gaps. I don't buy it, Tomalak. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Put it through in here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I have a minute? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, if the computer's programmed to allow Data to transportdown, it would figure that it would allow him to beam back up. Right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you mind if we take one of these with us and have our peoplestudy it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe you haven't heard. I tried to kill him yesterday. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. RO JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was seven months out of the Academy, my head still ringingwith words like duty and honour. When they turned on him, I thoughtthey were a bunch of self-serving, disloyal officers, so I grabbed aphaser and defended my captain. Two or three others joined us, but itwas clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them. We felt a need to get off the ship. There was a running firefight allthe way to the escape pod. About five minutes after we left the shipthere was an explosion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He? Data, we don't know that this can become alive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Tamarian ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Blood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How about, until next time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you remember anything specific about us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could we have two coffees, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, our help is all they're going to get. They can't force usinto anything, can they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate auto-destruct? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Selays are playing hide and seek down here,obviously with the Anticans. It's a lethal game. I want them returnedto their quarters under guard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've established visual contact with the warship Q'Maire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But why the holodeck? It doesn't make any sense. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we know how they think, shouldn't we be able to get somethingacross to them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley, I've assigned you the command of the planetary mineralsurveys. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not possible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been meaning to visit the mall myself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The fact that it's travelling at its presentvelocity suggests a possible answer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! Damn it! Damn it to hell! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are there any others? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You reacted fast, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, they're going to have to adjust. Open a channel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We considered it. We knew it was a possibility. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could we get through with our phasers? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very charming. It has your touch. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a hole in space,with no crew aboard. Now what is the purpose? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. Take us out of orbit, Ensign Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lethal? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, we need to jettison the entire engine core. You'llneed to extend the shields once it clears the hull. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So I've heard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not much. The injury reports are increasing too, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher's got everything under control, Geordi. Ifthere's any change, you'll be the first to know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't believe anything's overtaking us this fast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're not taking those Vulcan ships home with them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or more? You never told me that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not altogether. Astrophysics reports that the star's rate ofcollapse has increased. It could go supernova in the next few days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were at the Academy together. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know, Geordi, but I'm going to find out. Right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't exactly sworn my undying allegiance to you either,Baran. For instance, I'd like to know a little bit more about the job. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Carmen, have you got construction started I didn't know about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You look a little sore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi, please have Rivareport to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Access your data banks under humour, subheading slapstick. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. It'll take us four months just to get there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you're convinced it is the Borg? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll be in position to use the tractor beamin less than an hour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't have to do that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He will have to come with us now, Endar. It is up to Starfleetto decide the consequences. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? Computer, emergency order to Transporter room three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here's your loose panel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They are, sir. Which is why they have made the First Officerdirectly responsible for an engine's conditionand performance. Guided, of course, by one of our Chief Engineers,Lieutenant Commander Argyle in this case. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I grew up in Alaska. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Lieutenant La Forge. Prepare a technical support awayteam. Meet me in transporter room three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you want to be with him, you don't have to ask my permission. It's the look in your eyes. I recognise it. You used to have it for me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alexander! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ishara? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Got it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Changed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. Fire when ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Primary control's shorted out.  WORF <eos> <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's a good thing. I almost didn't make it off the surface. When can we get started? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wasn't a hero and neither were you. What you did was wrong andI was wrong to support you, but I was just too young and too stupid torealise it. You were the captain. I was the ensign. I was justfollowing orders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's delicious. The pipius claw was excellent. I also enjoyedthis Bregit lungs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As First Officer of the Enterprise I think I can promise youthat's not going to happen. The Kes will be denied membership. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alone, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your twenty, and fifty more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Triplets? Worf, there is something damn odd down here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase to ten to the third power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. Be prepared to beam back before the Captain returns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They might have been able to repair their engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I'm sure I will. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How far? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Uh huh. I see that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, secure Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I open that entrance and it's still out there, we're dead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Confirmed. The MS One colony is underattack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just stored. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've located a planet thatmay still support life. We'll know in a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I could get us on the Enterprise. I can find the artefact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's trying to project something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Please. What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On the Bridge. Not this time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would explain why they haven't respond to our hails. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just want you to know that I have the utmost respect for thelaw. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They know each other. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually, Guinan, I <eos> <bos> RIKER: Halt. Commander, you and I need to have a conversation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you like to transfer backRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are slots along the wall, kind of like compartments. Thereare two Borg in each. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instantto be in two places at once. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security to the Bridge! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Optimal firing range in fifty five seconds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've never encountered a natural force that powerful. Why onlysix hours? Why not a day? Or a year? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The seismic activity makes those caverns very unstable. In myopinion, it's too risky. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wes, come in please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It seems awfully strange that a malfunctioning sensor would givesuch a specific misreading of a planet. I would have thought that atime-space disturbance would have caused a lot more confusion thanthat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The tricorder indicated triolic activity from most of the bodieswe looked at. If the aliens left that sort of signature, they'll bedetectable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's only fair to mention Wesley in a logentry, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That'll be quite a juggling act. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jason's quarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You find something amusing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well of course. Think about it. A blind man teaching an androidhow to paint? That's got to be worth a couple of pages in somebody'sbook. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you certain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, the interior of the house? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I said, shut up. As in close your mouth and stop talking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know that. I believe we were with Lieutenant Fratis i nmolecular biology. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Surgery. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope it's enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not going anywhere. You'll be one of us soon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Detain the vessel and quarantine the pilot. Is he armed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, if we're going to have further dealings with the Borg nowor in the future, I think that we should find out all we can about them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll manage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drop your weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In the interests of diplomatic relations,I'll remain here with Mistress Beata while you conduct our search. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is Riker. We've got a problem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Load all torpedo bays. Stand by phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We cross the border in thirty seconds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shall we begin the scientific tests you wanted, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, you're absolutely sure? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have your favourite wish, my young friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Valtese ship has arrived. Chancellor Alrik is ready tobeam aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Ares. She's in Vega-Omicron sector. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Use your sleeve. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Quiet! Does he have it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My cards are getting cold. Here you go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Into the asteroid? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Attacking? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The number of troops under your admiral's command? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I saw you. I thought I might join you for a stroll. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fighting off all the species you've insulted would be a fulltime mission. That's not the one I signed up for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you need to continue to develop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Working theories are fine, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A concussive charge would blow out the security fields. We couldgo in with phasers on wide beam, stun everybody. Sort it out later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ah is right, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently, Deanna being on board is only part of the reason. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If he stays at that speed, he'll self-destruct. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll let me beam them? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who was that? You just missed him. Is there a new Lieutenant onboard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Federation space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not now, Wes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know if they'll let me do that, Jean-Luc, but I willask. JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: There'd be no harm, would there, if I gave them something I knowthey'd like? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: You wanted to see me, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't know how long I've longed to tell you that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This room, it's more than a holodeck, isn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing yet. The pod is thirty two hours overdue. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My friend tells me you might know about the man we're lookingfor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, we're in position. Your status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it wise to send two humanfugitives in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt village? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit justbecause I'm unbeatable? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did he look like? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And more over here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great job, boys. But, computer, blondes and jazz seldom gotogether. Now that is truly exceptional. But more sultry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's what we were thinking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Third time today. Stand down Red alert. Reduce speed. Return toour patrol route. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Step away from him, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have that kind of time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He is engaged in other duties, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've made yourself very clear, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to transporter room three. Prepare to beam Ensign Kellerout of the engine room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Mintakans are beginning to believe in agod <eos> <bos> RIKER: In about a week. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think that deserves some kind of explanation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about freedom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, there was a restraint. It was flat and metal. It was madeof metal. it came down over my legs. No, no, it was across my chest,right here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know what that was all about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Admiral, with all due respect, it's not necessary to giveCaptain Jellico command of the Enterprise just to conduct anegotiation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up untilthis moment I had the luxury of time, but now I've got to make achoice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let youstart these experiments again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it iswrong today. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Can we get to Engineering? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The odd reading? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Superior? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Drop your shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know Jeremy well? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire thrusters. Gradual acceleration to forty percent power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the comm. panel, the replicator. Youcan lower the lights on a verbal command. If you have any questions youcan just ask the computer, <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is no way to live. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room one. I am programming the coordinates. Standby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't worry. We'll be out of here in a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's nearly as large as the Earth's orbit around the sun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not one of you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, one of your people can do the work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, beam La Forge backimmediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Almost? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Soren. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fourteen hundred hours. Mister O'Brien, no maintenance on thetransporters until further notice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Generators? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It almost did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give me that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There they are, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, this way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of theseeruptions is awesome. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excalibur, Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, Data, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If this keeps up, it will tear up the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pawn to king's bishop three, Queen's level. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. He's on foot, couldn't have gotten too far. Let'sassume a radius of ten kilometres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You are endangering this ship for no reason. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did he die? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, if you didn't contract for this, who did? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's wonderful, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like a juggernaut, it could begin moving at any moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I think we can make an exception in this case. Vash is aguest of the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know how I would feel if the situation were reversed, if theywere in our territory holding a Federation citizen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you do less? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You what? What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can our mortal enemy be over a hundred years behind us inweapons technology? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard made has some inquiries. He managed to get me aposting on the Gandhi. And considering how long I've been out ofcommission, it's an amazing opportunity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've never even seen anything like this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then it's my job to see nothing goes wrong. Did I said somethingwrong, Captain Picard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you know about <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me. I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may beable to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate thebrain, speed the healing. In fact, I think you did that for me once,when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear afriendly voice, even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've beenbusy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusualthing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else? Ifinished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check itout when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Somehow, they're different. Let's get back to the ship. We'lltake them with us. Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We'd better return to ourship now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we weren't scanned by that probe. How did this thing getaboard the Enterprise? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Luisa, it's very beautiful. I could arrange for you to see it ifyou like. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's happening again. I think you'd better get inhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try it now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Belay that order, Lieutenant. There's no time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Name it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a vacation planet, eh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That knot won't hold. If I may? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've shut down most of the consoles tosave power. I re-routed just about everything through here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you plan to get our people out of Prytt territory? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're a mission that has no apparentpurpose. In itself, I can accept that. All of us can, because theCaptain says it's important and we trust him. Then he runs the crewthrough efficiency drills for the first time in my tour of duty, but hesays we need them, so we need them, because we trust our Captain. Butwe also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know anything about this, Mister Data? Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Use your brain. They wouldn't be searching the shuttle if theyhad the artefact. Koral must have it. Where is that Klingon pilot? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I feel like such an idiot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand your confusion. My personal physician is much morefamiliar with these genetic irregularities. To be honest, I would muchfeel better back home under her care. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be there. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the Great Hall. Iwant you to lock the transporter. Prepare to evacuate the entire group. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've gotten out of them before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're with me, Lieutenant. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, we have a known spy on board and now we haveunexplained signals on board. I think it's reasonable to assume thatthey're related somehow, wouldn't you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've found the wreckage of a small craft. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. We're all here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you propose we do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just hope we don't all beam back lookinglike Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Rager and I were lucky to have escaped.

See if there are any unusualreadings or anomalies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Got it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain says Shelby reminds him of the way I used to be. Andhe's right. She comes in here full of drive and ambition. Impatient,taking risks. I look at her and I wonder whatever happened to thosethings in me? I liked those things about me. I've lost something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going to try to pose as Korgano? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So much for the transporter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Never mind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you resign? You walk away from all the people who care aboutyou? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You want something from us, desperately. What is it? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you playing or not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, have you decided where you're going yet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You heard me? I heard you. Transporter Chief, where do you showus over here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A friendly one, I hope? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will. The replicators on the station haven't worked for along time ago. It's been a while since I've had a decent meal. Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's get moving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're running out of options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Construction records? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You should have seen the first two. It took a while to get afine enough beam out of the phaser. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What can you do for him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported aboutthose weapons? They're razor sharp, split-second lethal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life isin danger. Step back, Yuta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it certainly was different. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We should also see if there's some way that we can neutralisetheir forcefields. We've got to let them know that we can adapt too,Mister Worf. We're no longer just fighting the Borg, we're fighting thelife experience they've stolen from Captain Picard. Now how the hell dowe defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And these get put into the large containment unit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'll have to be placed under arrest as well. Admiral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Evidently they're being held hostage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's nothing urgent. I'm sorry I bothered you. Good night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Firing second burst. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From the history of my forebears. Yankee traders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is our Transporter Chief, Mister O'Brien. Shall we? Captain's Log, supplemental. We have enteredCardassian territory, and are proceeding on our quest to locate thePhoenix. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nervous? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Data? Why all the mystery? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unbelievable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where're you fellows off to? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Scan it now. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't be modest. You can't tell me you haven't come up with afew culinary delights. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It'll hit the colony in less than fiftyminutes. Ensign, make sure you maintain a continuous transporter lockon all away team personnel. We may have to pull them out in a hurry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where will we get the trace pattern? The Doctor's never used ourtransporter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, if anyone else had said that, I'd suspect he was bragging. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reliable, steady, punctual. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Senior officers, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Protocol. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's our mysterious something, Captain. It is a forcefield ofsome kind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Left hand. Right hand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now's not the best time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status, Mister O'Brien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know you're on vacation. Probably like to sleep and spend sometime on the holodeck. But if you're so inclined, we could use your helpwith the Phoenix Cluster survey. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it's not naturally occurring? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, locate Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Glad you feel better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Glad to help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do. When you say Commander you say it like you say Sovereignto Marouk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I said main Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your colleague Soren was very helpful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, yes. Absolutely. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it was part of the table. It was here. It was right here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister LaForge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes! Absolutely! I do indeed concur wholeheartedly! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think they were after? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think my horsemanship is a little rusty for the Himalayas. Thanks anyway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you read the designer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage evacuation procedures for those decks. Geordi, we'regoing to need power back soon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a lot to discuss. Can't we be reasonable? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In our society, we share the responsibilities and the pleasuresequally. Which is why I am able to be here with you while the women ofthe away team go to find Ramsey. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You think this is funny? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer locate Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything to report? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many of them were there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In case it should become necessary to fight, could you arrangeto find me some rocks to throw at them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Counsellor Troi. Your mother's just come aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lore had been disassembled. He explained it as jealousy from thecolonists. And Data wasn't yet alive at that time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying it is and yet it isn't there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? I just asked if they would talk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A short circuit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, itseems they're carefully avoiding hitting the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A surprise party? Mister Worf, I hate surprise parties. I wouldnever do that to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That should reach almost everyone. Take a medical team to treatthe rest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's considered an honourable way for a Klingon to die, asuicide that takes an enemy with it. Which one of them was it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A class eight probe is just over two metres long. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what's that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The first long range reading. Magnificationten to the sixth. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, wasn't the Captain looking forward tothis mission to the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away, so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not going to make it that easy for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But I guess I'll have to get used to it if I want to get mycareer going again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold fast. Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No problem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something wrong with that one? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Discharged? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Matta! I had you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not the Captain I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't want to leave without sayinggood-bye. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut offbefore we could find out what was wrong. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise is in orbit. I had them beamed aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Commander is a physical representation of a dream, an ideaconceived of by the mind of a man. It'spurpose is to serve human needs and interests. It's a collection ofneural nets and heuristic algorithms. Its responses dictated by anelaborate software programme written by a man. Its hardware built by aman. And now. And now a man will shut it off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why wasn't I affected? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers. If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone cansurvive on this moon for long. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You look doubtful, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules ofAcquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data foundout that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is themost recent picture we could find. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lasers? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How the hell did he manage that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Stand by phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: True, but I've had fifteen years to practise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe none of it was real. Perhaps we were all part of a sharedillusion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Aft station, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay right where you are. Drop your weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. I'll inform the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When I sat down at the console, it triggereda response like I had been trapped. I had to get out of there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I'm not sure that I would either, Worf, since this isn't aKlingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, that's yourbusiness, but we don't get to Earth all that often. I'm sure we canarrange for you to have more off duty time while they're here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who'dfallen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard to the Bridge. Take us to within ten kilometresof asteroid gamma six zero one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, putting you down there only strengthens their position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Possibly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh? I would have thought otherwise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In what way? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep at it. We need those transporters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why the devil are we be going to this planet? Are there anyminers or indigenous life forms on the planet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I appreciate it, but that really wouldn't be necessary. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where's that cat of yours? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Having fun, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski. I'm theFirst Officer, Commander William Riker, and this is <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know that, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in theauthorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe thatthey're corrupt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As expected. Mister Data, Mister Worf, proceed as wediscussed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the electrostatic conditions are about as good asthey're going to get. If we're going to try this, now's the time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. It's been a difficult couple of days. I know that oneof your operatives has been on a mercenary ship investigating thepossible re-assembly of a psionic resonator. I didn't want someone tomake a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Join me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're the key to all this, aren't you? Who are you? Who areyou? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I awakened to find myself here in theRoyale Hotel, precisely as described in the novel I found in my room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Them? Who's them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you recommend? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll welcome our visitor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know it's probably impossible with Taris sitting out there,but it would give everyone something to do. You go and organise it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what does that leave us? Right. That's what I thought. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, you know I would never act like that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Somehow I don't think they'll let us beam over there and askthem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't know how long I've wanted to tell you that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good evening. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you all right, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And create the temple? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've just received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep SpaceNine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see whathappened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay there! Eject the chamber on my order! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who would want a Vulcan ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure she'll feel the same way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're on the edge of the Neutral Zone on impulse power, andyou're not concerned? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Remmick has left the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why wouldn't I be comfortable? They're waiting on me hand andfoot. I hope that they don't find out that I'm faking it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean there's something even more remarkable about you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've downloaded the Lantree's log, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you going to tell me that little boy's a threat? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe we left our tickets in our compartments. Mister Worf,I told you to bring the tickets. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is everybody all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Recommendations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're here to establish a dialogue, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our readings were incorrect. The Borg crew survived <eos> <bos> RIKER: A face off. The question is, who's going to move first? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Doctor, would this virus haveany effect on Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do me a favour. Be careful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. Don't want to come up short. You are keeping count? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lied, conveniently forgot, I'm not sure. I think it's somethingwe have to consider. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable,Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I won't be pushed into this decision. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Trakian Ale. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Request permission to begin planning a rescueoperation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been known to tell a joke or two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you find them all, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to senior staff. Please report to the Observationlounge. Mission briefing in ten minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, has Counsellor Troi beamed up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just a little misunderstanding. I was just clearing these peopleout of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You got any ideas? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't stabilise the shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shuttlebay two, stand-by to launch the Egg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's more than I expected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had an appointment. We were going to discuss <eos> <bos> RIKER: Matthew! Pola! You know this area is off limits. Come on, comeon. Boys will be boys, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ah, the class reunion. You saw a few old friends who had alreadytaken the test? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be glad to be relieved of this cargo. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess it's been a while since you've had to punch a clock. Let's go. Energise. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dead? Injured? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is the deflector ready? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Klingons are very thorough. I'm sure Commander Kurn hasstudied for his assignment just as I did when I served with them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Double 'em up. Here we go. TEXAS <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know if she'll have time for you, Wes. She's destined torule an entire world. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just like the Brittain. Captain's log, stardate 44639.9. The Enterprise hasnow been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent subspace distresscalls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a responsefor at least another two weeks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The procedure didn't work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's make it look good. Ensign, release the inertial dampers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been offered my own command. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got to narrow that down. What's happening with theenhanced sensor arrays? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly, Worf and I will stay here and look for <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's see if we can tap directly into the computer core. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is another change in the Borg behaviour. They left theirdead instead of vapourising them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was afraid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on target bearing to port. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence fromthe Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, I was <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was doing bat'leth moves with Mister Worf. I jabbed when Ishould've blocked. He caught me right in the side. It's a good thing wewere using sticks instead of the real blades. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering ourbread a little. He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer. I'veexamined Barclay's psychological profile. He's a history of seclusivetendencies. It was noted at the Academy more than once. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Telaka was my age, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Now, the first thing I think we need to discuss isthis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We believe everything in the universe has a right to exist. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It could be a distress call. Helm, take us into transport range. Doctor Crusher, meet me in transporter room two with a medical awayteam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We came here to help these people. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As I hope it will benefit mine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, we're going to have to terminate the beam if thiskeeps up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So that's why the ship's instruments have become so erratic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened to them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we can hardly hate what we once were. They may grow andlearn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I object! There is no basis for calling Crewman Tarses a liar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was she like? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course, Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coordinates set? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What a charming suggestion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, Ambassador, I think I should try tocommunicate with the Prytt before I sanction the use of force. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. That structure is surrounded by breathableair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They haven't. I've already spoken to the Hekaran government. According to them, only one ship has passed through the system in thelast week. It was a Ferengi trader. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, I need those shields! <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is not a Klingon ship, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How much longer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The women. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the locationof Outpost twenty three, the key to all of our defences in the NeutralZone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm still not comfortable leaving you here alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On our last stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir, they are not! I will obey your orders. I will servethis ship as First Officer, and in an attack against the Enterprise Iwill die along with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyaltyto Starfleet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There was an emergency reported in TenForward. Mister Worf's on his way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How's it going? ZERO <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just want to see your face, that's all. So we can talk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, you'd be asking one hundred andtwenty five people to die a meaningless death. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The planet Kurl? It's a hell of a long way outside Federationterritory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I checked in with Wesley and Geordi a few hours ago. Therewas a moment when I actually thought that the two of them were going tohit one each other. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then why are they so desperate for the felicium? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, prepare to extend shields. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I don't know. Put us back on our original heading, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, go ahead and depolarise the entire power grid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another E-band blip? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Concur. Ensign, slow down to half impulse power. Adjustcoordinates to intercept this, this whatever it is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we can give the Captain a new bargaining chip. DoctorCrusher, flood the cargo bay with your containment field. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, any update on the Vulcan ships? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This game is now wearing very thin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Advise Mister Barclay to join us on the Bridge immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And we'll experience actual battle conditions? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we should let him try it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not there any more. What's left of that deflector is laidout on the floor of our cargo bay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're just too damned efficient, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm just an average, everyday human who happens to be aCommander. Now, what were your orders? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tasha, you and the Counsellor. And, Geordi, I want your eyesdown there. You and I will start with topside. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concernis with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisonerto that of Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's a Klingon. That takes a little more explanation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rather than let them be taken prisoner. Stand down Red alert. Mister Worf, advise the Klingon ship to signal us as soon as CaptainPicard and Data are safely aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. Prepare phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I take it he found something wrong in Engineering? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When in Rome, eh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standing by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back intowarp, our weapon is useless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything you'd like to talk about, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now we know what they mean by Advanced Tactical Training. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He does? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And not even a thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You look like you're packing to leaveforever. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to have to go down there to find it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, this appears to be a basic training ship. Five boys,all teens, all wearing uniforms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thoughtthat we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you haveall the time in the world, until. Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recommend we set the Enterprise on an intercept course in casehe needs emergency assistance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't sound convinced. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Surprisingly good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I'll pass on that. I'd better check in. Enterprise, comein. Captain, do you read me? Let's. This may be nothing, but let's moveall our people together. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks to reachthem at impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That might have been one of the shortestassignments in the history of Starfleet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll need a little more time to make this decision. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! Wesley, I may know best of all. Our friendship, our longtalks <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer wasdamaged? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It certainly is. We'll try to make you as comfortable aspossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it's a sign of strength. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you intend to do, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data and our guest appear to betardy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One survivor. It's a Borg. Male,adolescent. He's badly hurt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was vague, the way you recall a dream. I remember thesensation of feeling trapped and something about a smooth surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. I can't make you come with us. Are you familiar with one of these? We'll be in the system forthe next several days at least. If you reconsider, please contact us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What woman would have him with an ego like that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer. Summarise service record. Riker,William T, Captain. Begin with the Fornax disaster. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We think we can assume the Captain is aboard that shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. All hands, battle stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. He's a friend of Doctor Crusher's. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see any ofthis. You're not involved. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lay in the course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's Talarian. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. We're having difficulty getting a fix. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mistress Beata, before we see living examples of yourcompassion, may I speak? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Eight years ago, I led a team to evacuate this station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not our position to interfere in the domestic affairs ofother societies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: These symbols don't match anything in theFederation linguistic banks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, serpent worms. Would you like some? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Clones? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What will happen to him then? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Taris, if you've got phaser capability, prepare use them now! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm going with Worf on this one. Let's be careful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're an excellent Chief Engineer, Lieutenant La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure it's still in the memory banks,but I used to have a great fishingprogramme on the holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, do you hear me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do I do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, what do you say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. I'll have time to go get him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your eyes. What happened to your visor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't a Federation ship. These wallsaren't tritanium. It's close, but it's material beyond our technology. Let's get to the Bridge. There's got to be an answer to all of thissomewhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. See you for dinner. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why is he making it this difficult to find him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Menthars hide them in floating debris. An unsuspecting enemyship flies in. Instant booby trap. <eos> <bos> RIKER: By whom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you for coming on board, Mister Dokachin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know, but this is different. He's different. I can't put myfinger on it, but I'm worried. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nelvana Three on screen. Still no sign of them on sensors. In away, I'd rather be fighting my way this, It's just too damned easy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, send a subspace message to Starfleet command. Securitychannel authorisation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That doesn't sound like you, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's beamed himself aboard the Stargazer, and I'm wondering ifthis has something to do with it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've been intercepted by the Klingon vesselBortas. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't we have a call to pay on the Romulans, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait. I don't understand replicative fading. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you became a member of their crew? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing yet, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The south-west quarter covers over two hundred squarekilometres. That's a lot of land for one man to cover. I guess I'dbetter pack an extra pair of boots. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Assume a high orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three, two, one, now! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then why haven't I heard from you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow usout of the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My people won't stop looking for me, Tomalak. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should ask his cat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could the same treatment work for us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Halt. I know how hard this is for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. One to transport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. If I pick a minorsubsystem, something non-essential. Like this. Warp field phaseadjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interferencegenerated by the warp engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That must cover a lot of ground. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did we get him back? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then send in your own probe, Goss. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been studying this ritual of yours. Do you know what I've decided? I think it's despicable. I hate everything about it. The casual disregard for life, the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour. I may have to respect your beliefs, but I don't have to like them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could this have been a hoax? <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge. Hull temperature falling. We're in the clear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're jumpy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Check out the primary system. See if you can get some powerto the rest of these consoles. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come to intercept course. Keep us out of the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reset subspace communications. Scrambler code, Riker One <eos> <bos> RIKER: How far does this game go? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do we do now, Captain? With them monitoring our every moveand every word. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want the cloning equipment inspected. Who knows how manytissue samples were stolen. We certainly have a right to exercisecontrol over our own bodies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Captain Kargan. He wasacting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Serve this shipas I have! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we lose containment, we should beprepared to separate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're approaching the shuttlecraft. The creature is covering it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A seven, and a six, and the ace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For a man in his position, he doesn't seem to know much aboutthe situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I told him I'd feed him while he was gone. I was just puttingdown the bowl of food. The next thing I know there's a hissing ball offur coming at my face. I hate cats. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm notconvinced about Lavelle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's a senior Admiral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go to work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To the bitter end? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starbase one seven nine, this is the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain from First Officer. They're finally sending amessage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What battle? When? Which sector? Which unit? Mister Data, if weleft immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost twenty three? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell is happening? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Let's be ready for anything. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transmitting what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Security Chief. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The lines. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher and her assistants are waiting in Transporterroom three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana, don't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, I think our guest is going to have a lot of engineeringquestions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good idea. If you would accompany the Counsellor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Similar conditions. They were monitoring a planet that wasbreaking up, not a collapsing star as in this case. But there were thesame huge shifts in gravity, <eos> <bos> RIKER: We demand that you return our crewmember immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the situation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's going to be a hell of a gymnast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coils here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All engines back full. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't just leave her there. They'll giveher these psychotectic treatments. I don't know what to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors picking up any signs of life? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What has happened? What happened to Sickbay? To you? To me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How much has been changed? What exactly did you do? ONE <eos> <bos> RIKER: What does C forty seven control? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are about to lose warp drive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At ease, Lieutenant! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In all trust, there is the possibility of betrayal. I'm not sureyou were prepared for that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, there's half a million amps flowing through that arc. Could your body handle that much current? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you should pursue it. First of all,she's a beautiful woman. She seems to be crazy about you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were able to open the probe and examine it. Apparently,whatever had locked onto you must have been self terminating. It's notfunctioning any longer. We found this inside. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd better run a complete scan. Keep me posted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't matter. What I was saying was I'll be damned. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we even knew where to send it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not your commander. My name is William. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've received a distress call from theOhniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had no effect on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This guy knows all the tricks, doesn't he. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will explode. But if we stay here, we're dead anyway. Maximumenergy levels, five seconds. See you in a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You never told me you knew him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yourself, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're still here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on Data, we'd better get down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what happens in that futureallows us to change things now, so that some things never happen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We may need the power from the saucer impulse engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. Please report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we should switch quarters. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you ever heard anything like this, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Able. A good officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, sit down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And how much might anything be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: From what we've seen on the Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not havetime to help herself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sickbay, this is the Bridge. We are ready tobegin loading. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only way we knew we'd come out of warp was by looking out awindow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's find a turbolift to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was she like? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Muktok live for hundreds of years. Here it is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know, but, maybe we went about it the wrong way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red Alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I made it a couple of years ago down on the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello. I'm here to see Soren. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's an understatement. I can't even <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach inprogress. Prepare for emergency beam out. GAINES <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd appreciate it if Commander La Forge and I could stay hereuntil the Enterprise returns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have relationships with others? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, Data, you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Over here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're receiving a message from the SheliakCorporate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I remember my early lessons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're investigating the disappearance of a Vulcan ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have more time, Doctor. Once he was wired into theBorg, they knew everything that he knew. I just hope it goes both ways. If we're lucky, he had access to everything we need to know about them,especially their vulnerabilities. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Talarians are movingRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go to impulse. Back us off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps we should discuss this at your next evaluation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Slow down. I lost you back there. Which sensorclusters? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're clear of the nebula, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Lock phasers on the Romulans and hold your fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Admiral Raner? How many other people know about this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering EnsignSito. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If this is because your mother objects? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. Stand by to transport to the Enterprise. Here we go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain's death hit me pretty hard, and I may not becompletely objective, but there is no one who is more determined. Iwon't rest until I find out who's responsible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, let's say we initiate a full power warp pulse. Howmuch time do we need to drop out of warp? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, you're with me. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a flyin amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel whichappears to be the Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning,yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team. Hopefully, the answer lies over there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm listening. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's what happened to the Vico. They didn't see anythingcoming until it was too late. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What, no seconds? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we must play a game, what would we win? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Code one alpha zero. Ship in distress. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, did you have a nice vacation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. I'm glad you came. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders. And I will do exactly that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I can handle that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, Mister Data, warp speed, please. Just in case Taris'sengineer is not as efficient as our Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Assuming any of the survivors made it this far. Admittedly, it'is the closest planet to theOdin, but to travel distance we did in two days at warp one would havetaken the Odin escape pod five months. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Have you got a flush or a full house? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're the closest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds pretty routine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you stay with the deflectors, will they protect you whenthe storm hits? NELLA <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's the children. That's why we've been brought here. That'swhat they wanted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First Officer to First Officer, Kazago, if your Captain Bok knewabout this, then why this peaceful meeting to present us with theStargazer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge, this is Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. The mines are laid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That sounds like quite a project. How long will it take tofinish your studies on Kaldra? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it served your purpose, yes. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are we still picking up the Entity's pattern? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then let us meet with the men from Odin one last time. Let metry to convince them to leave with us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Play? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what's our best bet for cover? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have attempts been made <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've got less than nine minutes before the storm reachesthe northern perimeter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but without his help, I'm not sure we'll be able to poseany intelligent questions, let alone come up with any solutions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope I'm better than you realise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lavelle. Something I can do for you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're saying he's dead? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's it, isn't it? We're on equal footing now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, tell me about noranium. It vaporises at? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The signal ended abruptly at oh four five five. Unable to raisethem on subspace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've already contacted the Klingon High Council. You'll bereturned home as soon as we finished our investigation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stop it! What do you want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Guinan? I don't remember you ever callingthe Bridge before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Hera is reason enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. Excuse me. I need to speak to her alone fora moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. We'll discuss this later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mistress Beata, if you had an alternative to the execution ofRamsey and his followers, would you take it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're sure spending a lot of time over there. I wonder if theyLAFORGE <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up! Go to Red Alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not exactly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That won't accomplish anything, sir. There's no way they cansave Narendra Three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Already? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're all delusions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It usually refers to one's own memories, Captain. Do thememories you were given include farms, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors at maximum sensitivity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me wasrecognising and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed aniron hand. I imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with acrew that is so different. I would be happy to guide you in thatregard, if it would be helpful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? Tomalak is a Romulan Captain. The only timehe was ever called Ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy. How do youknow about that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I remember now. I was in an alley. They attacked me from behind. I tried to fight them off with the nisroh Worf gave me. I managed toget off one of them off me but I think they injected me with some sortof drug. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Chief O'Brien in Ten Forward? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't the Bridge. Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You get Morag. I'm going to the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock on phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The words that Data recognised in the computer, boundary,border, road, they were all arranged in this design. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ben. How you doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When we reach the Hyralan Sector, we're supposed to rendezvouswith a Klingon transport ship. I'm not sure, but I think they may bedelivering another of the Romulan artefacts to us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exactly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any guess how long we'll have? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Establish position zero nine zero mark three four five at twentyseven thousand kilometres. Hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tricorders? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself. Maybe he can find something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And your father? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Was that an invitation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It might prove to be beneficial. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend some timeconsidering the Tarellian situation <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cover the ship as planned. Move out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Human beings have other ways of doing that. We have children. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Such as what you meant by a very profitable mission. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Motivated self-interest. Right now, the best place for me to beis here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think not, Mister Worf. It's just a piece of space debris. Ifwe hadn't sitting here waiting for the Captain, we wouldn't havenoticed it. Leave it be. Let nature take its course. How long untilCaptain Picard returns? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Please repeat the file. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, we need a solution and we need it now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about a computer core from thirty or forty years ago? Onethe Romulans are already familiar with. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three to beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we should take the Doctor's advice. Take this veryslowly until we've all adjusted, and then we'll talk to the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it's time we to leave this place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This has gone far enough, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your sanctuary, remember? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we know that, so do the Tamarians. Riker to La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is new to me as well. Please, don't go. We've got to talkabout this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I've already dined. Maybe you know a good Acamariandessert recipe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, I think we should call it a night. That's an order. We'll reconvene at oh five hundred. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Captain BenjaminMaxwell. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why the body suit? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bringloidi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starship Ferengi, this is Commander Rikerhere. I'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The arrangements have already been made. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lotof energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Otherscouldn't care less. There are no rules. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll have to take it into the Raman'sauxiliary control room. Their Bridge is too badly damaged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's not allowed. Your orders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any mention of a situation like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And we'd be able to see for ourselves. Let's do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Weigh it against the prospect of war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was being polite. I could've won in twenty moves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll go next. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to launch the construction module. I'dlike to get this over with as fast as possible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's still bleeding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd be glad to show you to your quarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. As soon as Data determined the microbrain's method ofoperation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed, Captain. Hold present position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So he can have a pipe and mug of beer in peace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sixteen years, you'd think I'd be able to hit that note. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This bug is persistent, I'll admit that. But I'm not worried. WeRikers are ornery, too. As a matter of fact, my great grandfather oncegot bit by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain, the snakedied. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not suggesting you trade an entire star system for one man'slife, but you've got to acknowledge that these were Federation ordersand he is a prisoner of war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what is the second option? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let it go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And why not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we go through there, where will we be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is the away team. We'reclear of the structure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room,sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ship and crew functioning normally, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She must be tapping into some sort of power source to producethese effects. She's not hiding that up her sleeve. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the food station. You can reach methrough the comm. panel. Later, we'd like to ask you a few morequestions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now we know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here byaccident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Spooky. Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But they wanted us to know they were there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He hasn't been doing a very good job. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, re-enable Bridge control. Securityprotocol, Riker omega Three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, you may not be aware that our normal interface alreadyroutes auxiliary power through three separate relays. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Speaking of Klingons <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell me what it's supposed to be, then I'll give you my opinion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? I didn't kill anybody. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Speaking of time. This may be your time. I shall personally missyou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring the engines online and take us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all yours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll set a course. I want this thing cleared up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you can pull that off, Mister Worf, it might just give us theedge we're looking for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What I need is to get out of this cell. I've been locked in herefor days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,and what to think, and what to say, and when I show a glimmer ofindependent thought you strap me down, you inject me with drugs. Youcall it a treatment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The old Bandi city's being hit hard, sir. Many casualties veryprobable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know how or why, sir, but warp powerappears to be back to normal levels. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's a busy man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He cleared the Iconian programme from his own system. How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In what way? Haven't you seen how much I regretted not savingthat child? Using the Q power to save her may not have been wrong. Nomore than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldierthings. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If he's been influenced by an alien, wouldn't that put us all atrisk? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have evidence that you're behind it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll start a pattern search from this point. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Move! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, thank you for coming. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever's going on. our first priority is getting back controlof the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit. Set course for the Barradas system, warpsix. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's worth a try. Captain T'Jon go to your transporter room. Contact me from there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When it comes to this ship and this crew, you're damned right Iplay it safe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint Station? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said I was terrified. Of what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It appears we will have some time before reaching Braslota. Iwas wondering if you'd agree to play me in a game of Strategema. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, that's how we're getting out. We're buying this place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not turning into a philosopher, are you, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You must be in heaven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get theprobe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reachMarijne Seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Get it fixed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Especially since two new exobiologists and three stellarcartographers have joined us from the Zhukov. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have to admit I had a feeling you were different. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, thanks. I don't like fudge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, we need a diversion, now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Belay that order. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long till meltdown? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that. I can'tstop thinking about you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't see the connection. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nobody knows the transporters better than O'Brien and La Forge. They tell me they've managed more than a little sleight of hand withour authorisation codes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Armaments, Lieutenant Yar? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But I did win. I was betting that you wouldn't call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's completely intact. There's less than point zero zero threepercent signal degradation. How is that possible? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What have you been able to find out about him so far? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then let's get started. There's nothing more familiar than theEnterprise. Maybe that'll bring back some <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know that too. 'For exceptional valour during the evacuationof the research station on Nervala Four'. I looked at his servicerecord. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That star's going to go any minute, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it looks like we got someone's attention. On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They either don't see us, or don't see us as a threat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make it so. With dispatch, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's an interesting twist. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of this crew. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing I've been invited to. Any of you? Very interesting! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's all you care about, starting these damn experimentsagain. Look around. This room is filled with dead bodies. These peopledied because of this thing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it made an impact alright. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think this is one instance where you should suppressyour natural tendencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long before we rendezvous with Captain Picard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is my sister. She's angry. She's got a vicious temper. Iwouldn't cross her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed, sir. Short and sweet. God-like efficiency. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've assumed they've simulated your voice somehow. I've alreadyput Data to work on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can that be from a planet with no people? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean you're using this ship to transport a sentient being asproperty? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll keep you so busy you won't have a chance to. I've got toget going. I have to get back to cargo bay two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any luck contacting Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't let you do this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar,and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable ofkilling. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure, sir. Are we alone out here, Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He has been injured. I am in command now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are they recovering? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All stations have reported, Captain. Thereappears to be no immediate threat to our ship or the crew. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's all? Riker to Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've sent out twelve teams so far. I've gotyour team searching section gamma two four. Worf and I will take thetaone six when the last team comes down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't do this. Soren! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence thismorning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusualgoing on in the Devron system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't care what he's been running. I just ran out of patience. <eos> <bos> RIKER: According to the schematics, the engineering computer coreaccess is down that corridor. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Allenby, set a course for the Gamelan system. Warp six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap medown, inject me with drugs and call it a treatment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is he alive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it's a very special day. I thought the father of the bridewould enjoy being relieved early on the wedding day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is me. It's what I am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The medication Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find away to keep going. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it's very pleasant, but that's not the point. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd be a fool not to realise how lucky I am to be on this shipserving with these people. It's like a dream come true. Just like this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then take your best shot, Locutus, because we're about tointervene. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I won't let them hurt you. You'll be safe on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, it's over ten metres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Success, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I could beam into the turbolift, force the doors, take them bysurprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you contact Doctor Selar when yousaw that he was beginning to go? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I can understand why you're feeling uneasy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds promising. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Barclay, what's going on? Barclay! <eos> <bos> RIKER: A couple of hours. We have to cut through the bulkhead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what about the computer's recreational data base? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am Will Riker. I don't know who or what made it back to thePotemkin that day, but it wasn't me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But this is not the time for change. I need you all where youare, where Captain Picard always relied on you. I have been,reluctantly, forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert onthe Borg, is an ideal choice at this time for first officer. Based onour latest communication, we can assume that the Borg survived thefleet's attack. Your thoughts on our next encounter? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to have to tell them something. Open hailingfrequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it's time we talked to the Captain about Broccoli. That's what Wesley calls him. Keep it to yourself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, we could use a hand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jazz. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She may not be the only one. The science teams that went down tothe surface fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were morethan curious about what's outside their world. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With your permission, we'd like to begin our search immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you copy that, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have no questions, Your Honour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jazz. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How soon before the process is in place? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't look like any blast point I've ever seen. The shapeis too perfect. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what Riker might that be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are starsand the universe worships the night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, activate security containmentfield. Deck thirty six, section fifty two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're justtrapped in their own anger. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which one of them is real? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher asked me to steer you past Sickbay. She saidyou've been looking very tired. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have my father to thank. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do have one request, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't waste time chasing down sensor ghosts. We shouldprobably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closerlook. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something else, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Miss Henshaw. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Harmless, but effective. Were you able disable the photons? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase shields to seventy five percent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor fromthe planet Brekka, and T'Jon and Romas from Ornara. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you help me get out of here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your orders, sir. How would you like me to get over there,sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did I miss something? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Help me! Help me!  MAVEK <eos> <bos> RIKER: Boost power to the shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're going to make a break for it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The entity, has it abandoned him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi's up to speed. I trust his instincts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Janaran falls. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll stay here. I'll be finished by the time the third windowopens. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They probably want to see what we're so interested in over here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you come here for something in particular, or just generalRiker bashing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What if you're wrong? Sorry. But what if it is more than a merediscrepancy? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give me that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excellent. Doctor Crusher, meet us in Transporter room siximmediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're lying! <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do these artefacts have some religious or cultural significance,something that would make them valuable enough to kill for? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. I was just heading for deckseven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back onschedule. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay concerned, please. The safety of the Enterprise may beentrusted to these two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you make of these? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who would have thought we'd see him laugh out loud like that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible. I was just thinking about an old-fashioned lemonade. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excellent. Exactly what I need. Ah, Mister Worf. And the goodDoctor, bearing gifts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Riker's plan is more dangerous, but it does have abetter chance of succeeding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Grissom is near the Sigma Erani system. I'll alert them tostand by in case we need more hytritium. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, damn it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fajo doesn't know that we're onto him, so he probably isn'ttaxing his engines at top speed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've received communication fromthe freighter Lalo, as well as from a farming colony on Coltar Four. Both described the same time distortion. The Captain of the Lalodescribed it a hiccup. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unfortunately it will have to be a shotgun wedding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I heard you, Lieutenant. I rejected your plan. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Possibly disassembled components, identified as Vulcan,recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm leading an away team over there to get the Captain back. We'll find a way to bring them out of warp. Ensign Crusher, youcontinue to assist Mister La Forge. Commander Shelby, you'll take theBridge and coordinate with Starfleet. Data, Worf, Doctor, you're withme. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Curious isn't exactly how I'd describe it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Soren. I love you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you need medical help? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will it take to set up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But that's what you're talking about anyway, isn't it? Alteringthe past. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we don't know what we're looking for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, at their current speed, when will they reachEarth? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Locutus of Borg, this is Captain William T. Riker of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think there's enough food here, Data? Good evening. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, please report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprisematerial. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something's wrong. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. Securityteam, meet me on deck seven, section twenty five baker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait, sir. Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you picking anything up, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't say I'm sorry to hear that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A complete sensor scan of the planet andthree survey probes turned up no surprises. No signs of life, nothingout of the ordinary. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For safety reasons, we're shutting off all power to theHydraulics room before entering to recover the body. Then we'll beamhim up to Sickbay, but from the look of his wounds, it's probablyhopeless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope that'll give the Captain enough time to play his hand. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't think Worf would allow them access to the battlebridge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're in orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't stay, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last surviving senior officer. He will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff inEngineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're ignoring us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alert sickbay to prepare for possible casualties. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a real maze down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from aCardassian planet near the border. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, when you get involved with another person, there arealways risks of disappointment, of getting hurt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Actually, I learned quite a bit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Ral, congratulations on winning the rights to the Barzanwormhole. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're approaching the surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You seem a little vague on the specifics. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've been studying the sensor logs and the torpedo telemetry todetermine if there was any malfunction. If there was, and we are ableto isolate the problem, another test might be successful. In themeantime, all of our facilities would be made available to DoctorTimicin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're fine tuned enough to see your hosts gathering in theopen area outside, sir. Three of them are heading for your location. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Unless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't leave Geordi behind. I want the Pakleds on that screenand I want them now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your twenty, one hundred more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge. Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure beforeyou make them? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase to full impulse. Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam the shuttle crew back once we're in range. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you think it means? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's our guess. Like a man with no immune system, he wasn'table to handle the overload. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any other way around? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Paranoia, I'd say. But of what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Let's consider evacuation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, tell transporterroom two to stand by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'm not an alien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rationale? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've locked onto something with markings onit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll manage. Right now, they're more important. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not that hungry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually, he and I have been able to patch a few things up. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who built you, Commander? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look, I feel the same way. We all do. But if anything's going toget done. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's how you rationalise these attacks? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps we should to pay a visit to the Tripoli. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our apologies, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're supposed to verify its authenticity, and then I'msupposed to kill you, and I take your place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Better than I am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell them we have an emergency situation. We'll begin a searchas soon as we've completed that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you know him, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cause? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any other ships respond to our queries, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ever since he came on board, I find myself thinking about thechoice you and I made. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, I brought something back from Risa that you have got totry it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your recommendation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe Doctor Crusher can treat you and bring you back to the wayyou were. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ah, you're wrong, Mister Worf. It's fantastic. And it's ours. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Meaning somebody engineered it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, of course. And these rocks and vegetation have much simplerpatterns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolatedincident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in thatcorridor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cancel Red alert. Mister Worf, take the weapons offline. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proud warrior Worf, without a single tie to his own kind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough tohandle all that information. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Metal fragments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On whose authority? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why's that? Not that I disagree. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise, come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many people on board are capable of doing this, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If anyone can improvise, it's Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One propeller, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data also saw a straw in my head and then Beverly discovered anorganism in the same place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Radue, exactly why were we invited here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, you used a colloquialism. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker. Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir. You'll be able toshape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet. You haven't decidedwhat you're going to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What makes you say that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I agree. We're at war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker,First Officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With our shields in their present condition, we can't <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to do this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, at our current speed, how long will it take us toget through the asteroid belt? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My pleasure, sir. Ma'am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How's it going? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so. But hehas not been showing any overt unusual behaviour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All deck, this is the Bridge. Brace for impact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're back, Geordi <eos> <bos> RIKER: Head injury? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. As soon as you complete the repairs, I want you backhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock on tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you've got to stabilise that tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you worried that I won't be able to say no to it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, orWorf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made from sugar and spice,and boys are made from snips and snails. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Verify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I assumed as much, sir. We've also located the remains of ahuman. Request identity scan. Colonel Richey. American. First initialS. Roughly the same time period. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. You did a good job on the Borg ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. Good luck. First Officer's log, Stardate 42479.3. We leave theSolais system confident that Riva will help the Solari achieve alasting peace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will somebody please get that! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. We'll make all preparations. Commander Data, return tothe Enterprise immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello, sir. Feeling better? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my mark, point seven five burst. We just want to get theirattention. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise from away team, come in. Are you receiving us,Enterprise? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And we still have more faults <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. I kept hoping it wouldn't be here. That it had beendestroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would three Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken downfreighter? <eos> <bos> RIKER: An admiral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Primitive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who asks the question? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened to these pieces of metal? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's probably a good idea. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's odd. Hail them. I'm Commander William Riker from theFederation Starship Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll understand soon, Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Activate security fields decks eight throughfifteen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it in control of you, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I reconfigured that computer so many times they probably can'tmake heads or tails of it. I'd be happy to help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Jarada will expect the Captain'sgreeting. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, why don't you give me the overview of your researchwhile Mister La Forge and your assistant take a look at theexperimental data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which suggests that he wasn't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you waiting for? Raise the shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for seventyfive years? <eos> <bos> RIKER: To make sure he wasn't tampered with? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, we'll see. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Granted. Tell Mister O'Brien to take all the primarytransporters offline. I don't want to risk any further contaminations. Make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it scanning us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I should never have made that agreement withyou. I could have saved that child. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we are approaching Science Station Delta ZeroFive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They would see that as deception. I must meet with them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An adventurer? Aren't you pioneers adventurers at heart? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, get us out of here! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf. You said there was other evidence they wereinvolved. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Type? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So they could have appeared on Earth as humans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reduce life support to minimum requirements,Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want some answers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their main computer is off. All sensors reveal that all of theequipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send anymessages. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All of it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Certainly. We can step into the Ready room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could they have beamed an explosive device aboard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering is modifying one of our subspace resonators toact as a new engine core. It won't do more than warp two, but it'll getthem home. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again in a fewdays, and I wouldn't be in as good a mood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You've got the Bridge. Keepyour eye on them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It would take a powerful weapon to do that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you know, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rather a nice run of luck, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You didn't take any cards. You must be holding something. Whynot make it a little sweeter? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Question, sir, could it be this Q? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Prime Directive doesn't apply. They're human. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deck nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf. Fire. To Be Continued <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Glad you could join us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Admiral Necheyev has just beamed aboard. She's being escortedright here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I refuse to allow this, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I would look up into the sky and I'd think, if Itried hard enough, I could make you feel my presence. That if I couldlet you know that I was alive, maybe you'd wait for me. I know itsounds crazy, but there were times when I could've sworn. What am Italking about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you have no objections, Doctor Crusher would like to examineyou and your group. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Rager, cartography needs a betterposition to study cluster thirteen. Bring us about, heading onetwenty three mark four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we may not be able to get control of this situation. Irecommend we arrange transfer of all non-essential personnel to thesaucer section. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors have picked up another E-band emission. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How the hell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try again! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll have to take your word for that because I don't rememberany of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want toremember. I guess there's only one thing we can do. We've got to buildsome new memories. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, she's bought us some time. Let's make the most of it. I wouldn't do that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She was on the ship with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All transporter rooms, prepare emergency evacuation procedures. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've broken orbit and laid in acourse for Daled Four. We will remain on impulse power until LieutenantLa Forge completes his adjustments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have nothing we can compare it with. It's microscopic. Itseems colonial, simple. But it's inorganic. Which is why the reconscouts missed it. It was not your mistake. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Posted by proud parents? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not a question of harm. One William Riker is unique,perhaps even special. But a hundred of him, a thousand of himdiminishes me in ways I can't even imagine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get that man off the Bridge, now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here you go, Vanessa. A little something for you, too. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And remembering. You should have been the one to die, not her. Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Half impulse, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There was nothing provocative about what she did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your hurry, Harry? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exactly. And since they equate intelligence with strength, theywon't pass up the chance to use that knowledge. Can you do it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, Riker. This is turning outto be a very long tunnel or corridor, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We tracked two ofour crewmen to this area. Do you know anything about them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Hickman? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker will not survive if I am removed. He has done enough. Yourword. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A cook's only as good as his ingredients. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, is this possibly related to the energy fields on theplanet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's clear some of that away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, he stays. Because I've been given unusual powers, Iam not suddenly a monster. Except for these abilities, and I don't yetknow how far they go, I'm the same William T. Riker you've alwaysknown. Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Go to Red Alert! <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've been at war for so long, it has become personal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I will not help a friend commit suicide. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you'll find it's a fascinating talethat we've come across here, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like they had a rough ride. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all about you, isn't it? You're the only constant, the onlyperson in both places. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's got to be a ventilation source somewhere. We need somelight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Including the Neutral Zone border. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said he made a pass at you, but youfailed to mention whether he was successful or not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bad news? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exit Holodeck. You do this every day? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You should've moved the bishop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me, sir, but those weren't natural instincts. Those werepoker instincts. A card game doesn't exactly prepare me for this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates forpeace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What can I do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, if you've got a theory about what's happening? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I have a schematic of the explosion site. It suggeststhe cause as a methane-like gas seeping in from underground. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That won't give us enough time. We need to occupy them longenough for you to install the relay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, you did, from computer twelve B nine, deck thirty six. Thecomputer logged in your identification from your communicator. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Wesley, reverse our direction, set a course for theCornelian star system. Impulse power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rather the reverse, sir. But a Captain's life means a great dealto me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics, Sophistry and the AlternateUniverse by Ving Kuda. You call that light reading? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually, I was thinking more about Ensign Ro. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recommend you don't fire until you're within forty thousandkilometres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we just sit here, we'll lose all of our systems within anhour, including life support. Okay, I'm rerouting the propulsionsystem to the transporter. Re-channel the navigation systems. Let'stransfer every microjoule of energy we've got. Sensors, life support. This might give us one last shot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One thousand fourteen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool forhistorians? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you report this? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Help me! Help me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we called their bluff. Status, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you approvedRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's hope that's enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You suspect trouble? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Captain Picard is safely aboard. Fire phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom. Perhapshe could assist us in lifting his brother's spirits. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't wait three weeks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Those events did happen, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even with a treaty, they're still skittish about protectingtheir border. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what happens to the colony if she does? If others join her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: At least, sir, all the department heads have reported the damagerepaired. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd appreciate it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Marquez has already set up on thesurface. Apparently the storm is still gaining speed. He's estimating <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, a glass of water, five degrees. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going on, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One sure way into the record books, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf. Geordi. Troi. Join me in transporter room three for anaway team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Re-establish your firing pattern, Mister Worf. We'll wait fivemore minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treatyviolation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've traced the problem to the power transfer beam. There'ssome sort of feedback coming from one of the colony's weathersubstations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The wars are over, Yuta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A wormholes is there one moment, and then gone the next. Astable wormhole is unheard of. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting we use your own body? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was on the Enterprise in the middle of a play. But it washere. It was not real, it was on a stage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They'll only be vulnerable for an instant as they becomevisible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, hard to starboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So much for that idea. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will it affect Geordi the same way? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She needs our help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With the saucer gone, I assume somethinginteresting happened on your way here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. His security scans came up negative. They're stillchecking the sensor logs but there is no indication that you ever leftthe ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It does appear to be Federation issue. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report to the Observation Lounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have the miners searched them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drop your weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand, sir. As soon as my people have made certain she'ssafe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you aware of the details of the Battle of Maxia? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm willing, Doctor. Although we're not officially part of theEnterprise, I thought there might be something useful we can do whilewe wait. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then pick the body and let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their sensors should have picked us up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Seventy three, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've worked hard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Step away now. Medical Officer's Log, supplemental. CommanderMorag and Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept under close observation. Sofar, no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can we be sure these records haven't been falsified? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. What's happening, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing foryou to do now is to ask to get Tasha back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That must take some of fun out it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Answer me. Where is Soren? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know, Data. I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great work, Doctor. Now, if I can get out of here, I'd like toget back <eos> <bos> RIKER: Waiting for you topull another rabbit out ofyour hat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality ofhis mother's death. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transfers are to be approved by me before any offers are made. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wes. Sit down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can arrange for a tour of the ship, if you'd like. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, our position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a good deal of interference,but you are getting through. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we access it from here? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, keep moving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it.  CRUSHER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Most people think so. But that's the kind of question that wouldtake a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planetwhere the people have no gender? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set course for Styris Four, warp three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will discuss that with your captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the engines can't handle the strain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As the First Officer, I feel it's my responsibility to show youall the amenities. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And how much would your confidence cost? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forty seven, including the captain of the Adelphi and twofriends from my class at the Academy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the damage to thereactor is greater than the Tagrans led us to believe. The fieldmodulator is installed and operational, but it's not going to beenough. The reactor has already gone into overload. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We would like two torches. Head high? And what else? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I didn't. Geordi, I may have seemed a little harsh about thesituation aboard the Raman. I just don't like the idea of one of mybest officers putting himself in unnecessary danger. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Someone has to confront him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait. I've got it. William. It's a great name. William O'Brien. It's got a nice ring to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good luck, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The point is, they may be reasonable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker, WT, reporting as ordered, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then either way, his memory would have been erased. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When the Enterprise comes back tomorrow, we'll get a crewstarted on that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right away, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. There's a delegation of Ferengi who wishes to bebeamed aboard, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's in there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have to return to my ship. Come with me. You don't have tostay here anymore. You don't have to be alone anymore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you thatregrets what you've become. Listen to me. You don't have to do this anymore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, I bring all the alternatives to the Captain'sattention. That'll be all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I've always wanted to see you as a brunette. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. What about the luminosity studies? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You haven't used my first name once, Paul. You remember it,don't you? You don't, do you? Because you don't exist. You're a fake. You're an image of the original, aren't you? Answer me! <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is it. Short-range craft, two twelve hundred fiftymillicochrane warp engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rendezvous with the saucer section. Lay in a course of pursuit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an empath. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior tous? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our destination is the Endicor system. We're due to arrive inthree days. The charts show nothing of consequence, certainly nothingto threaten the Enterprise, between here and there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's in the case? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Haven't we gotten you a replicator yet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd think she'd at least get to her own wedding on time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data,prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you'll follow me, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where am I? How did you get me off the ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are going to need your help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, I don't know, Guinan. They paid us a visit. It seems onlyfair that we return the courtesy. Captain's log, supplemental. We have been attackedwithout provocation by an alien race which Guinan calls the Borg. Itappears that we have neutralised their vessel. Commander Riker isleading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell them, tell them we haven't finished yet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Tainer, we'll meet you intransporter room two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought I had. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you noticed anything unusual? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You call this healthy? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We found the power source to the shield andwe've neutralised it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How is that possible? Is something wrong with the sensors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: About everything that's going on. I'm sorry. I'm sure it willall work out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. Data, you've got the Bridge. Inform the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, align the Enterprise so we appear to be one of theabandoned ships. Mister La Forge, when we're in position, shut down theengines and all systems except sensors and life support. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I honestly don't know, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't sound very optimistic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did it get in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know what it is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When you spoke of the prisoners, you used the termrevolutionary. Indeed, death has been known to stop revolutions. But Isuspect it's not a revolution that Angel One is hoping to stop. It'sevolution. Mister Ramsey and the Odin survivors did not initiate thewaves of dissent that are rippling through your planet. Their presencehere merely reinforced the change in attitudes between men and womenthat was already well under way. They became symbols around whom otherswho shared their views could gather. You may eliminate the symbols, butthat does not mean death to the issues which those symbols represent. No power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution. Bewarned. The execution of Mister Ramsey and his followers may elevatethem to the status of martyrs. Martyrs cannot be silenced. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry to interrupt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They may not be able to withstand another hit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With your permission, I would like Acting Ensign Crusher aboardfor educational observation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any light they have must be artificially generated. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby. Walk with me, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When we brought the shuttle and the other Picard on board, wecommitted to a sequence of events which may be unalterable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. All science stations, stand by. We're about tolight up the nebula. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, we've been through this. We tested the exocomp and itfailed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starbase twenty nine. He had never heard of me, and they had noofficer that fit my description. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'd be gods, which we're not. If there is a cosmic plan, is itnot the height of hubris to think that we can, or should, interfere? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. Could we just continue with the evaluation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I might. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something wrong, Wes? Commander Kurn perhaps? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get a tractor beam on her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In what sense? It sounds like he put you through hell. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying you think there are people living in there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your scan was inconclusive. We don't know what happened to theYamato. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor Troi's ill. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is sounding better all the time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid that was me, Worf. I was checking to see if thephasers still operate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hang on, I'm coming. Enterprise, lock usonto her signal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll do the best I can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From where did the ionisation come? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'm sorry to disturb you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Raise the shields. Where are the Klingons? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've never settled for anything in my life. I know what I want,I know what I've got, and you'd be lucky to do as well. Lieutenant. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Chief, do you have them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll think about it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twenty, twenty five minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reunification? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Minister, I thought I should let you know that the mercenaryship which has been raiding planets in the Taugan sector is probably onits way to Vulcan right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir, I'm sure they all died with honour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. Secure channel, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or be cloaked again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mrs Troi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or anywhere else along the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If the entity decides to attack again, the Captain may be facingit alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you know that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am too. Don't worry about it. I can handle Shelby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Residual thermal traces. Somebody stood here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A phone call? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then it was constructed by someone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay will find out what it means to be threatened. Computer, discontinue image of Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Survey team here. Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going to happen to the mercenaries? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is where we started, if we are us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all youroptions, you tried every alternative, and then you made the hardchoice. Come on, let's get out of here, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've reached the outer regions of the Beta Stromgren system. Oncourse for orbital intercept of Tin Man, eighteen minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've recruited a few Prytt spies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And death? One of the symbols was death. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet. There appears to be some kind of a slickblocking our path. Will keep you apprised. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got a clear path to panel J14 baker. What's that going todo for us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He took the bait. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well as soon as these negotiations are out of the way, you and Iare going fishing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. Mister Worf, if you're worried that they might learnabout what happened on the Klingon planet <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think itis, it's actually worse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, signal them on subspace. Request their status. Geordi, seeif you can tell if it's one of ships we've been looking for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you direct any more power to the shields? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep notes. This project might turn out to be of interest toscholars in the future. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are we going to go, Ethan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign DeSeve, by order of Starfleet Command I am placing youunder arrest for treason. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ship's stabilisers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll pass that along to the crew, Captain. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

She diedwhen I was very young. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You must have been asleep, Portal, for hundreds of thousands ofour years. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hooked it. My father took the rod away. He wouldn't let mereel it in. He was afraid that I might lose it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's better than standing around helplessly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it was my fault. I got distracted at a crucial moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you doing up there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it makes you feel any better, you're not alone. CaptainJellico has made major changes in every department on the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Iceman wins again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, listen to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That array has such a narrow scan field. We might as well breakout the palm beacons and try to find them that way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: An android. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's been a long day. We've all been through a lot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whoever did this could still be on the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not part of the plan. Pipe it through. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think you were right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To your success, doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take it easy, Wes. We're going to find him. I want to begin amethodical search. Worf, set sensors on maximum scan. Data, use ourpresent location as a centre. Plot a search pattern from thesecoordinates to cover the most area in the least time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is she still underway? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For honour students, only the best. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it's all right. Come on in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twelve decks away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We may need your presence here, Captain. We have serioustrouble with a member of our away team and an unusual law they havehere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know what you mean. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe there's someone waiting for us in the ObservationLounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: These are the more palatable choices. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They are a sensible race. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll findthem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Congratulations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: W arrived a little late. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me know if it reoccurs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready all weapons, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. Captain, do you read me? Can wecompensate? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Certainly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We recognise your situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, are you abandoning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want you to know what really happened. It's all my fault. Iwas attracted to Soren. I pursued. I insisted. I didn't understand yourways until she explained them to me and rejected me. Nothing happenedbetween us. I ask your forgiveness. I behaved inappropriately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, Mister Worf, get a security team on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes. See if we can slow them down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Widen the area. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got fifty eight minutes before we have to power down anddisengage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, just some strange sensations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome to the Enterprise. I am Commander William Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. Any sign of thescience team? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That can't be right. We were told the Array stopped relayingdata six days ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a little too selective to be coincidence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare your security team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've been out there a long time, Data. There must have beensome deterioration. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Commander Data was there, yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great. Strange. For a long time I did whatever I wanted,whenever I wanted. It's been hard taking orders again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This first encounter, coming so suddenly after all this time. Wehave to assume it's a setup. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've switched to manual control of the air handling system.  PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They don't want to take on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't mean to be indelicate, but who's the father? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not that simple. This was his crew. He wrote the book onthis ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our systems came back online a few minutesago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The colony laboratory. Extremely well equipped. Does this stirany memories, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll get us out of here, Ethan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about communications, sensors, life support? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that Iconia? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, whydon't you give me a call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge, engage engines! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I had a lot of time on my hands when I was down on thatstation. There were days I felt so alone I thought I might lose mymind. Do you know how I made it through? I thought if I hung on formore day, they'd rescue me. Maybe I'd see you again. I guess thingsdon't always work out the way you expect them to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The triolic levels are as high as they wereon Devidia Two. There's no indication of a control mechanism. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's been no direct contact with the Romulans since the TomedIncident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe this. Is this a dream? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The European Hegemony? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. I want it inshuttlebay two for examination. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Countess. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, we did. It's in one of our cargo holds. You act like it'smore important than your comrades. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars,and the universe worships the night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sooner or later he'll have to feel the burden of command. EnsignCrusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't talk about legal rights. Your jurisdiction is basedentirely on the threat of violence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have we got our phasers back? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maintain pursuit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, who's his mother? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a good chance we will be able to retrieve the databasefrom one of the consoles inside the station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. If you believe those accusations, then you certainly shouldact on them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let go! One of us has to get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nope. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by phasers and photon torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, will you help me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What could he want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about my people? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Paul, I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Whydo you want to know so much about my ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's out of sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A lifeform? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. If this is a real phaser, then I was on the Enterprise. ButI fired it on myself, so I should be dead. None of this is real. I'msetting this to level sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half ofthis building. Unless, of course, this isn't a real phaser. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've done everything I know how. It's nouse. Without Tog's security code, I can't get near their communicationsystem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's one thing I'd like to say. I question your judgment. Inmy opinion, your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled acrosssome sort of alien library? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I believe we've have the answer to what happened overthere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maintain position at Galorndon Core. Diplomatic initiativeappears to be succeeding. Will advise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our first move will be shut down the engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I doubt if they were there for the climate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. What did you find? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. And I you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can provide you with a kitchen, but it won't really benecessary. These food dispensers can synthesise anything that you maybeen. I'll show you. Sovereign, may I offer you a drink? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As the First Officer on this ship, I have to set an example. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drawing on the log record of the construction of the prototypeandroid Lore, also constructed by Noonien Soong, I request to beallowed to remove the Commander's hand for your inspection. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dan, no! <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Iceman's finally melting. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go to backup systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have all the time you need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: His saddle? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll be on the Bridge. Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories aboutAldea, thewondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman ofXerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needsfor all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to artand culture. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering. Is something wrong, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the devil is that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A shuttlecraft? How's that possible? I thought we were the onlymanned Federation vessel out here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Emergency transport. Get me out of here. Captain's log, stardate 46778.1. Commander Rikerhas returned safely from his mission to Tilonus Four. Doctor Crusherhas repaired the damage to his long-term memory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is your problem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unidentified craft in the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Service record, Riker, William T. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Correction, Data, I should have said proverbial needle in ahaystack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, perhaps there are a few things we should talk about. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You? Tongue-tied? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Troi, you've been at it enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe, but we need to figure out how to use it. How is he? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This I think you should see for yourself. Bring Commander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We may need to attempt a long rangetransport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Five or six weeks. + <eos> <bos> RIKER: How are the others? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why this module and not the others? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain this is incredible. We've entered what appears to be theBorg nursery. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew evaluation reports. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd rather not send anyone back down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why do they want with me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't there something more we can do here to seal the rupturesomehow? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commence rapid fire with all weapons on full. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I take it the Captain was able to negotiate an agreementmutually beneficial to both parties. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What were you doing accessing the propulsion system files onStardate 44758? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One of their ships must already be en route. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And yet in both the past and the present there's a report of thesame anomaly in the Devron System. I find it hard to believe thatthat's a coincidence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've accessed the command pathways. The interlink pathways arefunctioning now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't see Doctor Apgar until the following morning when heasked to see me alone. Commander La Forge returned to the Enterprise. Resume programme. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you have this ability to travel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. We will have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But it'sa chance we have to take. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They will also listen to the reports of the Captain of theEnterprise and his First Officer. And I can tell you right now theFirst Officer's report will go something like this. Kesprytt, a deeplytroubled world with social, political, and military problems they haveyet to resolve. The Kes, while a friendly and democratic people, aredriven by suspicion, deviousness, and paranoia. It is the opinion ofthis officer they are not ready for membership. Now, the matter of ourmissing officers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Earth Station McKinley has advised they're ready to beginrefitting the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Navigational sensors show that we've travelled sixty five lightyears from our previous position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know this one? Twentieth century, Earth. Maybe I can teachyou a lick or two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Borg usually collect their dead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forget to set your alarm, Wesley? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, yourtouch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think seem soreal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, Wesley. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't believe me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then pick the body and let's get out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If they're right, would you be able to use the transporter toreverse the effects? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, it's my duty as First Officer to safeguard the lives onthis ship, including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you,sir. Certainly not in this situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're new around here, aren't you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A charity hospital near the waterfront. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander La Forge to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no degeneration. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fencing? I'm really not very good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From the sound of it there's not that much difference betweenour species. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There has to be. My relationship with Soren is not trivial. She's very important to me. It's my fault that this happened. I have tohelp her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here, Captain. We made itRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reduce to half impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, what the hell happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's full of energy today. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you correct for it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No sir. I didn't understand that kind of hostility even when Istudied Earth history. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fifteen minutes after that, another. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The bet is ten. That's to you, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What would that be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The distress call came in only four days ago. Why would DoctorRozhenko have waited so long before sending it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks for letting me sit in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's give it a try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would she lie like that? She was lying. You could tell. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He seems to be handling this quite well, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're not going anywhere until we get to the truth You're a spy,aren't you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Meaning if I set up a simple oscillation, I can send out asignal. The trick is to create a message that the Enterprise willunderstand but that the Ferengi will think is just normal subspacestatic. What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, set a course to Galorndon Core. Take us to warp eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. The play is full of disturbing images. People losingtheir minds, being tortured by doctors. I can't get it out of my mind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did any of them know why they'd the response? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, arm the photon torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't listen to me. Forget the fact that I beat you in thirtymoves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe we've covered every available alternatives, Captain. Are there other options that you want to analyse? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did he say when you turned down your own command? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then trust me now. Meet to discuss terms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't need your fantasy women. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: We picked up a request for emergencyassistance from a Federation science ship in the Topin system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've reached the core, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Eleven hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No wreckage was found, so Starfleet officially declared the shipdestroyed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pick a card. Don't let me see it. Now lose itin the deck. Cut the deck into two even piles. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, we have not even attempted a diplomatic effort yet. I would rather not use force until we've exhausted all other options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't know that we have twenty hours. That star could explodeat any moment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's almost time. I want the boy broughthere now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're a wise man, my friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, you take that area. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your ten and ten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have to ask you about your husband. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, start working on the problem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've arranged for a shuttle to take you to Starbase twentythree. You can leave the ship at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open a channel to the Tamarian ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Start gathering everybody together. We've seen this before. Weknow what it is. Now get moving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back intowarp, our weapon is useless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Resume previous course and speed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No one was more surprised than I. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're prepared to talk, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. Magnify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Round up everybody who was left behind. Take cover. Try to avoidany contact with the Borg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shall we separate the saucer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Federation will not start a war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then why, in all of our history, is there no record of you orsomeone like you ever having visited us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: According to Hayne, the Coalition and theAlliance raid each other for supplies, much of it non-essential. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take it. You always had the better hand, in everything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They agreed to trade places for a week, to understand eachother's situation with more informed eyes. After that an agreement cameswiftly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it's something Troi warned me about when we first startedto see each other. A Betazoid woman, when she goes through this phase,quadruples her sex drive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields at maximum. Full reverse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And now you want to try it again? How many people will die thistime? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, troubles. We've got some, Captain. It seems that a certainwoman, both wealthy and beautiful, now thinks that that she's going tomarry me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it dangerous? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wallace and Towles. Ready? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just a game. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up, photontorpedoes activated, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A whopping big one, and you know it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, the array has already been allocated to Engineering. They're running some warp field tests. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's right. If we could position the shuttlecraft far enough infront of the Enterprise, it could detect the pockets and allow usenough time to manoeuvre out of the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I must say I'm not overjoyed to see Remmick again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with theRomulans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, go with him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Swell. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna needs your help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They murdered a man in cold blood in full view of everyone inthe bar and you can't remember anything about them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, contact Dulisian Four and confirm this distress call. Ihave a feeling it may prove to be a false alarm. Mister Worf, how long before we intercept the Vulcan ships? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yuta, don't do this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Work, let's greet our guest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we find the source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: To make us believe she had died as a result of the malfunction' <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, I need help in locating some librarycomputer information. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To join us as what? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your action could be interpreted as an act of war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is not commonly known that during those negotiations, you,Kalin Trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your moon who wasattempting to assassinate the Beta delegate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Romulan! <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I have lost my memory, how do I get it back? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Inertial dampers at maximum. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course, Ensign. Full impulse. Riker to Transporter roomone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think you did the right thing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I only wish we were all as well balanced, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Kelso? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. Worf, accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Because there's nothing to be afraid of. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can't they go to local authorities? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There doesn't appear to be a base. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think we could adapt the cloak for the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, we need to get your rendezvous schedule to CommanderRudman on board the Merrimac as soon as you <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, I've never seen you quite so scared. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. Idon't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I happen to like poker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I guess I'll have to back out of Beverly's play after all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's part of life in Starfleet, Wesley. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need those phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't expect to fight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Without trust, there's no friendship, no closeness. None of theemotional bonds that make us what we are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can depend on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast anddie hard. The question is, why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Too dangerous. We've seen what those tunnels look like. Youcould easily be cut off from the rest of us. Worf, if we <eos> <bos> RIKER: I may get over there and want to come right home. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Yar is calling from Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing byto beam Ligonian welcoming party aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think that's an option we should be considering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Non-stop. I have to admit it has a certain strange fascination. How long can two people talk about nothing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three and six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd better get innovative. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying that Worf is spraying this <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell you what. I'll bet that I can find any card that you hidein this deck. And furthermore, I will make you help me find it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's too dangerous. Our scans show the caverns are unstable. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: I like one who's intelligent and sure of herself, who I can talkwith and get something back. But the most important thing of all? Shehas to laugh at my jokes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're lying. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Homeless? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: And there he sits, and he watches us struggle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've lost him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A few more seconds I could've saved his lifeWORF <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying you trust Tomalak? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Under the terms of the Selonis Convention, Captain Picard must <eos> <bos> RIKER: No help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Deck eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's nothing unusual about this house, except the fact thatit's here. What about them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, how's it coming? What the hell is that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, I'm getting readings onTactical. Are we back up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Were you able to contact the boy's parents? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's under a lot of stress. She's preparing the Cairn to meetwith the Federation Council. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something else. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is more important than Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand this. Everyone is protecting Sarek. His wife,Mendrossen, even you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Remember Sandoval? Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. Fang-lee? Marla Aster? Tasha Yar? How many men and women, how many friends have we watched die? I've lost count. Every one of them, every single one fought for life until the very end. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh. I see. I'm sorry. I'll see you in the morning. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't like it I would've expected a greeting party. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not telling me might affect my decision. Did you think of that? We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it allworks out. I've got to do something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, First Officer of the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you got a minute? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what's this about? Remmick is going to turn this shipupside down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We will use our tractor beam to tow you to the nearest base. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. The briefing mentions something about an uncanny linguisticskill. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here's your ten, and it will cost you another one hundred. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Killing lab lights now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've never been very good at organising my time off. Something'll turn up. It always does. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know of the simulation. What do you think? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps they have run out of people to kill. In any case,whatever the reason, peace is now preferred,which should make your job easier. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There must be only four minutes left. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It seems an equitable code. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that someone I should know of? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tai chi chuan. It's called the crane block. Now let's trysomething else. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when you realised, what then? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A little over eight hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When we leave 'audet Nine, I'm going to need all the power youcan slam into those warp engines. LAFORGE <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard to the Bridge, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. I get the idea. Captain, we are approachingDytallix B. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the crystal thing has begun to move away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any way to detect their self-destruct device? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll be a big hit in London. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There must be a missing link here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need to talk to you about the phaser test results. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've located the <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarianblood feuds, and I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemieswere. How could this virus have been transmitted, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't see any material in here that could handle that muchcurrent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell is going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They are that, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will that take? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I'll leave that to the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But that's our boy. Approximately five times our mass andcarrying enough armament to pulverize a planet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beam them out of there, Mister O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you been able to contact Deep Space Nine? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I gave you a direct order, Mister Data. Yourelease that transporter lockout now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We hope we're not interrupting anything important, Captain, butwe wanted to inform you that we have achieved orbit around Risa andwe're ready to beam you aboard at your convenience. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, withdraw the Enterprise. That's an order. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you mind telling me what's going on here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll have a complete power survey donewithin the hour. We'll probably have to supply them with energy forlife support, and they'll need a new engine core to get home. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi doesn't have several hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who's getting married? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Romulans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I'm a little confused. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold out your hands. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status of the Borg ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm just afraid of the big chair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. Mister Worf re-establish communication. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, try it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this message from Starbase Fourteen? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your little toy worked. Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life veryappealing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's a Starfleet officer. She's my responsibility. Your peoplehave terms. We're willing to listen. We want her back. It's as simpleas that. I don't think it's necessary to detain this gentleman anylonger. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Help me locate Wes. He's wandered off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It may have been connected to the main system, and when shelowered the shield she may have turned that off as well. If not, we'lldeal with it as best we can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell is going on? Q2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would they attack us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's some kind of probe. I'll bet that's what damaged thearray. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She was a formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That is not the purpose of the mission. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean to tell me all these people belongto the Ansata? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going back there alone. I want you to get the Enterpriseinto the Neutral Zone before it's too late. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Except for now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher, report to Transporter room three. Worf. Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, put us back on course. Let's stay at impulse for now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which explains the Ferengi's interest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where was it in the Captain's quarters, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just as you should, Captain. Ensign, evasive pattern, RikerBeta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Borg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll look over the schematics and I'll draw up a mission plan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Beam us up. Now! 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had twelve years to think about it, and if I had it to doover again I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at youinstead of them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you revive him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was she doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're saying an entire base has already been established there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's late. I am tired. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then it really was lucky, wasn't it, that we were able to findhytritium when we did. And just enough hytritium for this crisis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's too far down there. There's nothing to hold on to. No wayto climb down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly. I'm saying this to you as a friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jenna knows that and she has obviously decided to take thechance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's not likeanything you've ever experienced. The rewards are far beyond simplefriendship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shut down thrusters. Ensign, take us to one thousand metresahead of the barge and hold. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The repairs are almost complete. I wishthere was something more we could do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect aCardassian ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it is a Romulan vessel, it could be cloaked. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate transformation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me do it. I've had a lot of experience with this sort ofsystem failures. I might be able to do something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Two are lost, sir. But we saved four. I'm Commander WilliamRiker of the Enterprise. I'm sorry we were unable to rescue theother two. We did everything we could. If you had come instead ofsending your cargo, you all would have made it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like putting a fish in a bucket of water. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. Any communication, Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great story. I'll remember it next time I'm in a knife fight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just tell her I'll be in shuttlebay two. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why can't we go around it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could ride it through the rift and thenbreak away once we're clear. That is, if we survive the ride. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are roughly two hundred people down here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you do know what I mean. The best thing for you to doright now is go to your quarters and read a good book. If you doanything to make the situation any worse it's going to be that muchharder on you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I have to agree with the Counsellor. If you want to getahead, you have to take chances, stand out in a crowd, get noticed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The point is, you've completed the upgrade well ahead ofschedule. Very impressive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what proof? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. And it's not going to be easy to find out. ThePrytt have consistently refused all outside contact. We're going tohave to work through the Kes. Contact Ambassador Mauric. Tell him Iwant a meeting right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's probably nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would appreciate it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. Thanks for the game. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have a suggestion. First officer's log, Stardate 43174.2. CounsellorTroi and I are beaming down to Mintaka Three to locate Doctor Palmerand to determine the extent of the cultural contamination. DoctorCrusher has temporarily altered our features and skincolour. She's also implanted subcutaneous communicators so that anytransmissions we receive will be inaudible to the Mintakans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give me a direction. T'SU <eos> <bos> RIKER: Planetary defences? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And now they're here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, Data's out there right now, monitoring the conditions onDrema Four. The situation's become pretty desperate for hisfriend. He's calculated the safest location on the planet's surface. You can guess why. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A second transporter signal? From where? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll play these. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With Data, on the edge of the old city, sir. It's being hithard, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir, I did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, reconfigure high resolution sweep, radius onemillion kilometres. Check for any debris. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I feel like an actor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As per report, sir. Class M, Earth-like, beautiful. It willstartle you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're on our way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actualorder to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,but it works. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sending Hugh back to the Borg was a very risky, a very dangerouschoice, but it was the moral thing to do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's leaking ion radiation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good to see you, too. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You want us to search through all this to find him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about Captain Picard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's a long time alone in the dark. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And that's not all! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the mostimportant. You may want to start with something like this. You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. Butthat might not work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get her off the screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you in or not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In your position, it's important to ask yourself one question. What would Picard do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All decks, stand by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. I suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was its origin point? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's ordered us to withdraw? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going with them? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. Sounds good. Then you'll take care of that security thing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've a standard three shift rotation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd like to think so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Still four members of the crew unaccounted for. Did you come upwith anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Interesting hypothesis. Are there any M-class planets we couldcheck out? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reset dampeners. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like they had a battle with time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kevin and Rishon? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's starting to get busy around here. Fivenew science teams just beamed in from the Zhukov. Quarters are fillingup fast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare for impact. Medical personnel, report to the Bridge. Commander Data, check all systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what is its alert status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. They are firing on the Argus Array. They destroyed it,sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You did a good job. I'm proud of you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes sir. We have to assume that they've been trading theirsurplus energy for the construction materials used here. According toour ship's scans, many of the materials used are not found on thisworld. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Was he a prisoner of war? Who did this to him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then tell him that there is no way <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wes? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, you and I will try to get there. Mister Worf, this room isgoing to fill with wounded in a few minutes and they're going to needhelp. I want you to stay in charge here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The fleet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No wonder they didn't answer our hail for two days. Nothing hereto answer with. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't move! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe now we'll find out what they really want. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Allenby, set a new course. We'll take it through the asteroidbelt ourselves. One quarter impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hello, ladies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Climb! Come on! Climb! Climb! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is CaptainWilliam Riker of the Klingon vessel, Pagh. I order you to lower yourshields and surrender. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever you do, do it quickly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll get right on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nicely done. I hope we know what we're doing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An epidermal mold. Made to give your exterior the desired finish. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight fornothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you are personally responsible for the Captain'ssafety. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There is no delta shift yet, sir. I have spoken to thedepartment heads about changing from three shifts to four, and theyassure me it's going to cause us significant personnel problems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If there's an apple? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What a sight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, okay. Can you do it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mind a visitor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's going to die. They're all going to die. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief MedicalOfficer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Great. Just great. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, you know how much I respect your judgment, but Ican't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your belief. Preparethe exocomp, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Geordi, let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Some form of tai chi chuan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Permission to speak candidly, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And doesn't have to be told by a woman? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Troi? Is it the same as you felt down there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Over here, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just a sensor glitch? <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge, the intruder may try to reinstate <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's phased completely out of existence. At least, out of ourexistence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. We just bought this place, lock, stock, andbarrel. Consider it a done deal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. I think theresemblance is rather striking. Wouldn't you agree, Number One? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I can handle that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Eighty one kilos. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's the nearest one to our last position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Truly excellent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Full shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be inholodeck four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is different. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've a feeling somebody's going to be here to receive thosestorage tanks. I'd be very interested to know who that is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are we dealing with here? Are thesecreatures feeding on us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. I remember that now. But I thought it was a Klingon who hadcut me with a knife. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We may already be too late. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Okona seems to have excellent vision as well as a healthylibido. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission toStarfleet Headquarters. Mister Data, prepare to launch three level-fiveprobes. Ensign, aft thrusters. Standard observation posture. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ishara! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher suggests we might design achip that would automatically retune the phasers to a random settingafter each discharge. Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A judge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And that surprises you, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your two, and three hundred more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Minuet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your name is Mavek. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer. Display family record. Riker. William T. Limit tovisual. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensornetwork and make sure that we haven't overlooked anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have spend about five minutes greeting the Iyaarans maybe anhour making small talk at this reception. I'm the one who has to escortthem around the ship for the next three days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I want to talk aboutthe assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us out of orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Paul Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, he but carriesit well because he's usually right. He's a risk taker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In essence, yes. I find it surprising after all these eons thatthe Aldeans' have not perfected their technology. One would assume theywould be aware of the weakness and repair it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar zero zero six, warp seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Preserving life, all life, is very important to us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come. Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But you have no place to go? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I tried at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't even talk to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I almost cost you your life! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't Lieutenant Worf scheduled to replace Ensign Torigan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. I suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the Array. Wecan begin downloading their imaging logs, find out what the Array'sbeen observing for the past six days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher? Engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Never heard of it. Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you getting any life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: None that I'd care to share with an audience. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, scan left and magnify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge, let's get a diagnostic sweep underway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got thirty percent power. It won't be enough to stop us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You hit him pretty hard, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did we know? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Either way, you can have it back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket. He thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you're saying there's a connection between the radiationbursts and the explosion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you need more time to study it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Groppler, I could have sworn it wasn't here a minute ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dad. You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attaché? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The polar region? That would be starting from scratch, MisterData. Our latestreadings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That doesn't give us much time to retrieve the database. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Completely irrelevant. These people are professionals. Ifthere's a personality conflict, you're in charge, you settle it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is she? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently it was riding a Lagrange point, hiding behind RanaFour's furthest moon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? What is it? I mean, you must havesome way to repair it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status, O'Brien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wonder if the strong magnetic field of their sun might havesomething to do with it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? Because I'm only a man? <eos> <bos> RIKER: These are the best quarters we have. I was hoping now thatyou've had a chance to relax you might have remembered some of thedetails about the aliens you saw. Something you may have forgotten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unless he's borrowing one. If he's hanging over the planet'spole, the magnetic field would confuse our sensors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have you assigned to cabin seven thirty five. Deck si <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. It's not true. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To which one? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A Dyson Sphere? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Commander certainly appears to have the crew on its toes <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aquiel and Morag will be transferred to asecure medical facility at Starbase twelve. Maybe we'll know more bythe time we get there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the Justman, the shuttle Reyga modified. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could there have been some kind of interference from theRomulans? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No indication of a base at all? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do I keep my eyes open, or closed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I always will. Even when you're old and grey. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

For you, Data, something special. Don't be afraid. Theywon't bite you. And for you, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't believe they'd ask for your command. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, target two hundred metres belowthe apex of the particle stream. Feed the coordinates to transporterroom two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Those are Federation ships. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you like. It won't change anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no time to debate the issues. You're going with uswhether you choose to go or not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data. Interesting night? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not long enough for an escape, but used as a surprise itmay give a strategic advantage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for this. You want power? Here's power. Rikerto Ensign Gomez. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The ship is at risk as long as we're sitting here. We couldcontinue the investigation outside the nebula. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Mister Datais coordinating the salvage efforts now. Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I ask why, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a good deal of structural integrity, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Especially in matters of love. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Potemkin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It never occurred to me. This is what I am. Did you ever tell methat you are only a single being? Of course not. That was normal toyou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had no effect on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you might like to see this. Geordi's analysis of thesubspace distortion the Borg used to escape. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ma'am, excuse me. I really think that you ought to leave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got to tell you Geordi is not at all optimistic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A lot of people near death have talked about strangeexperiences, but I've never heard one so detailed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forget the explanation! Can you do it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're Betazoid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's panicking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate intruder alert. All security teamsreport to <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, take us away from this pulsar. Heading one eightfive mark three two. Full impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three days? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude. I'msurprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who used the beacon? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And here we are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maintain your position, Lieutenant. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're about to force the door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is the Bridge. We have arrived at Starbase oneseven nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll have you back at Betazed in plenty of time to meet up withthe Academy transport ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam Salia to the specifiedcoordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise. For how long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. Oh, by the way, you'll need this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have we got a fix on her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet asit did. It gives us some time to consider our options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What kind of rumour? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we work on the assumption they've all been destroyed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. We're ready to beam over, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have any. If we're going to get out of here, we'regoing to have to do it on our own. I'm going to get some answers out ofthat desk clerk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then devise one, fast! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have the sequence locked in, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. What is it? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: The aliens. Mister Worf, are the photons ready? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This should be interesting. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabitedplanet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is yourbusiness. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we'll have to take it ourselves. We'll use our deflectorsclear a path through the asteroids. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm available, Mister Remmick. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't understand. I can't give the eulogy because I won't beat the service. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What would be the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly,or allow them time to prepare for it thoroughly? Well, twenty minutes? Nice round figure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, there is. Give it to me. They've taken me for the last fewnights. If I'm right, the same thing'll happen tonight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess you're right. It's not worth playing this game. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We would like time to prepare our people for assimilation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm with you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Armed with ancient ball and powder muskets? <eos> <bos> RIKER: An old Chinese philosopher from ancient Earth history. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any request? <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I present Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And what about the Romulans entering the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We lost Crusher. Itappears he rigged a site-to-site transport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know whose voice activates it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you ready, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your knowledge of Klingon curses is impressive. But as a Romulanmight say, only a veruul would use such language in public. MisterWorf, please see to the security arrangements for our guest's stay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How far have these negotiations progressed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? We're not at all alike. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And to complete our business here, we are locked onto you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Playing it safe? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, aboard the Enterprise. We demand thatyou Cut that off! They're not going to besatisfied with anyone less than the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Captain, Data's gone ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, urgent. We must have ship's power, <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, The Enterprise reports a possible location for MisterRamsey and the other survivors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're right, Captain. It has to be conceivable that somewherein this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy intomatter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse theimpact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I felt like I was disconnected. Like it was something I haddreamed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Contraband. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yesterday, I did not know how to eat gagh. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It appears you've inherited someone else's problem. An old wastevessel caught by your planet's gravitational pull. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all right. Take it easy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm reading forty seven of them around the perimeter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering!. Engineering, come in! Geordi, are you okay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does wrestling with a Klingon targ ring a bell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have that kind of time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You, of all people, should know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Time to intercept? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will arrange for a technician to help programme your recipesinto the computer. Of course, I'll have to try some of them. What'syour specialty? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not yet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, of course not. This is the isopalavial interface whichcontrols the main firomactal drive unit. Don't touch that. You'll blowup the entire firomactal drive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hail the Yridians. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby <eos> <bos> RIKER: The debate is still going on in some quarters, but I think so,yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've arranged your usual accommodation, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, I hate to break this up, but <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A letter to his wife and daughter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She resides in the Old Quarter of the FirstCity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Check him out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander. I'll see what I can do to find you some more timetomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we're behind schedule for Parliament already. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. How's the arm? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it seems reasonable put that way. But I warn you, if youget hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't suppose that would work with people? <eos> <bos> RIKER: one seven zero one D Enterprise, shuttlecraft five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Chairman Songi, this isCommander Riker on board the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it wasn't made of wood. It was smoother, more metallic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, 1e're almost there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Later we'll try a flight simulation. Rightnow let's do a systems review. I'll talk you through it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it. Sovereign. Chef. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's out of his mind! <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can believe what you like. We're going to find our peoplewith or without your help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost peopleon missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with thisthing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we canrisk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll tell him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bortas has put out a general distress call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And how could I forget that you didn't have enough latinum tocover my winnings? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I can save Captain Picard, I consider that very acceptable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Suggestion, Captain. Why don't we execute a long range transportof an away team to assist Doctor Graves at earliest possible moment. We'd come out of warp just long enough to energise the beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can humans survive down there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Repulse, this is the Enterprise. We are getting underway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything on long range sensors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire when ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data has agreed to join me on theaway team, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They thought he was jeopardising the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs. Uhnari could havebeen responsible for them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Picard to the Bridge. All stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need that communicator. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screencommunication so we can see each other <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long would it take us to get to the Kalla system? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I think she needs supervision. She takes the initiative alittle too easily. Sometimes with risks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd giveher a challenge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could it be some sort of tractor beam? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For all we know, reversing course may be what leads us into thecrash. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, could a human host carry him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we stole a shuttlecraft, that would get us nowhere. TheRomulans could follow their own ship to easily. But if we broke intotheir communications system, we could send a message to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Corrosion, then? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Lieutenant, we're here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. If you'llturn over the inoperative part to Commander Data, we can begin repairs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice suit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled bythree primary main processing cores, cross-linked with a redundantmelacortz ramistat. fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The coreelement is based on an nanoprocessor with twenty five bilateralkelilactirals, with twenty of those being slaved into the primaryheisenfram terminal. Now you do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're not here to pressure you, Doctor. We just want an updateon your progress. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to holodeck control. Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What would you do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then she is alive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse us, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Youheard me. A collision course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but, it's still moving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: After Doctor Crusher declares you medically fit, you will beconfined to your quarters until a court martial can be convened. Findsome civilian clothes. I don't want to see you in that uniform. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll go get her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not worried about my weakening, are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, I'll notify Starfleet. I'll let them know what'shappening. You have your orders. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How about at warp seven? At warp eight? At warp nine? What's the matter, Data? What happened to those millions ofcalculations per second? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I find them very much as we were a several hundred years ago,but possessing the technology they have now, they're very dangerous . <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will he return to the planet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, those are two of your friends out there. They have savedyour life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd bewilling to sacrifice them like this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it having any effect? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pleased to meet you, ma'am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Delicious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Neither have I. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take the engines offline. Supplement with auxiliary power only. All decks go to emergency level seven. Life support and criticaloperations only. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Seeing the look on his face. I'll get you another drink. Two more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can respect his beliefs, but he is asking me to take an active role in his committing suicide. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you be more specific, Counsellor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which means exactly what? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf! Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta! <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate thosestorms. Do you have any ideas, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. You look strange, Paul. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, sir, Altair Three was too dangerous to riskexposing the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure I'll find everything I need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then maybe you should consider this. If anything happens tothem, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation, which means morestarships will be coming to Kesprytt and those ships are going to wantanswers which puts your country under a very large and veryuncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when wecontacted just one of your people without authorisation? Well, justthink of what it'll be like. Ten starships asking questions, contactinghundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even startsending down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find mymissing officers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, people do not have internal chronometers. Why don't yousee what happens if you turn yours off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Notify Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do we know what she was doing when this happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: William T. Riker, Commander, SC two three one dash four twoseven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Better jacket the scanning beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: None that we've encountered. In theory, accelerating beyond warpten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. We're from the United Federation of Planets. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In the novel. Right. How does it end? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall onyou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They were just playing dead. Conserving power until we got inclose enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll prepare an away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To the right? Fine, let's do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's complete, but I would like to request an addition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Toxic? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was that called? Mister Worf's a very good teacher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us to half impulse, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So the Federation sensors that monitor the Neutral Zone justmissed it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you got a lock on that other ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I'd better get a little rest. Clear my mind a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been on a lot of missions, seen a lotof people injured, but I've never been affected by anything like this. He was looking right at me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You just want me to prove that Data is a mere machine. I can'tdo that because I don't believe it. I happen to know better. So I'mneither qualified nor willing. You're going to have to find someoneelse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Was I that obvious? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have means of pursuit? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How will you proceed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd call that geological instability. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make it so. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our job is not to police the galaxy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, this is critical. How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready phasers. Prepare to return fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status of torpedo banks? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to half impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I strongly recommend that we go to Red Alert. If theRomulans have improved their cloaking device, and we'd be fools tobelieve they haven't, we should assume a more defensive posture. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, set course for Bersallis Three. Warp five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase power! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, initiate the quarantine transmitters on the Lantreeand activate her marker beacons. We'll need to find her again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nuria. Exceptionally clear-minded, sensible. The Mintakans trusther judgment. If we can convince her that you are not a god <eos> <bos> RIKER: Velocity, warp eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have much choice, do we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She seems to be fine. He wasn't able to establish a link on her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: O'Brien, what happened down there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you make the adjustments on the visor by yourself? It'lllook suspicious if you're both working on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we beam one over? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Devour vessels? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay. Everyone's still trying tofigure out exactly how you did it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you can imagine how much this means to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We received a distress call from the New Berlin Colony. They'reunder attack. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know that, but I have to do something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I want you to look over the medical records from all therescue vessels that responded to the Khitomer massacre. See if there'sany information on the aftermath that might help us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I must be. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge. They steal technology. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Placing beam-out marker. Return transport, fourteen minutes,forty seconds. Is your view any better, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Warp nine point seven two? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will we be delaying our rendezvous with the Hood, sir? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: That makes me even more curious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What if he's an imposter? God knows we've seen enough of them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And then he ran away? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who do you need sanctuary from? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then why did you accept this assignment? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: The pain's gone. Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Delusional? It was not a delusion. I was there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sensors are picking up an <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then they would learn nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think that's what happened twelve yearsago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus after we leftthe ship. The plasma ignited in space, and it looked as if the ship hadbeen destroyed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriateemotion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, join us in Transporter room three. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you,either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to controleverything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, andyou don't inspire these people to go out of their way for you. You'veget everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don'tthink you're a particularly good Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, prepare for the beaming operation. We're onour way. Wesley, Data, let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What sort of signal? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I don't think there's any record of an Earth colony inthat area. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Don't they seem a little slow? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I did what any good helmsman could have done. You did it first,sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will that take? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I strongly recommend redeploying allavailable defences to protect sector zero zero one, Admiral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First of all, android or not, I wouldn't ask anyone to take thatkind of risk. Second, if the computer is not working in Engineering,I'm going to need your help to get control of the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's senseless for this stranger to be held captive. All thistalk of the Overseer, it's old superstitions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't know Barclay played the violin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make that six to transport. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the big chair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was trying to feed Spot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were right. Somebody blew the hatch. They were all suckedout into space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you think of any reason a saboteur would choose tricyanate? <eos> <bos> RIKER: AcknowledgedRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. You're my friend. I thought, I don't know, I thought Ishould tell you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's the kind of a test that you'll have to take again if youwant to be a Bridge Officer. Only next time, the problem won't be soeasy, so I suggest you study up on your emergency procedures. <eos> <bos> RIKER: New friends, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you like me to leave you two alone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: You need a knot that'll tighten under pressure. Let me show you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if your theory fails to pay off? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, holding at station keeping,range six hundred and forty metres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. Have a seat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Generated by what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm willing to take that risk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, Okona is an interesting man, certainly. We've seen how hehandles his ship. Apparently he knows how to handle people as well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, yes, but not until later when he came back into the roomwith his little sister. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which leaves me back where I started. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any way to extrapolate am origin? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you shut down the entire system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Along the same principle as that which is draining energy fromour ships. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring down the door! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage cloak. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bajorans again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then he must be hurt or dead. When does our next window open up,Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare for umbilical disconnect. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any time, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's odd? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a long story, Mister Worf. I'll brief you later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you alright, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You didn't have to kill him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you here to work or to play, Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cloaking shields off. Obey my orders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and thesoul in my night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ethan, no! <eos> <bos> RIKER: All we need now is power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not possible. I'm Will Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're certain they'll negotiate? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, we've had this conversation a hundred times. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm in command of this vessel. Who are you and on whoseauthority do you <eos> <bos> RIKER: You are on board the Federation Starship Enterprise. We'retreating your injuries. How long were you down on Galorndon Core? Doyou understand me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I love surprise parties. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Navigators on this ship have been doingflight handling assessments the same way for years, Ensign. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rivas. Rivas Jakara. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One or both? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep us informed. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what's on your mind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. It's your daughter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what did you think of the Antedeans,Wesley? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well beam some of those ghosts back. One of them may be Geordi. Permission to lead another away team, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The computer should think all three of us are Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get back here! <eos> <bos> RIKER: For as long as she lasts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't understand the source of your misgivings, Mistress, butwe appreciate your faith in us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An interesting choice. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Resume. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know the feeling. The past few nights, it seems like as soonas my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up in the morning. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm certain the Ferengi are behind the faked log. No wonderthey're waiting out there. Headache back, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The ship is using a modified tractor beam tocollect vertion particles from the star. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought if one thing were clear by now, it's that you and Iplay things a little differently. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He was into some bad business. He took the evidence with him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we gotcomfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Return fire, Mister Worf. Full phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostiletoward human life? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll leave that to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You will bring it to the Bridge, immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to theship. I cannot let any Bridge Officer serve who's not qualified. I'msorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you be more specific? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Option one is beginning to sound better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're on board because of him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope we find them before they come out of their nap. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, that could have been anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you think that I? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is going on? JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Advise the warbird to withdraw from Federation space, and tellthem to leave the Vulcan ships where they are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll take you to Sickbay, after that <eos> <bos> RIKER: In fact I might like to say a few words. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know if it was enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And these? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, put controls on the restraining arm. A control panel. Lights. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just lie still for a while. We'll get you to Sickbay as soon aswe can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What punishment? Name it! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. I write this in the hope that it will someday be read byhuman eyes. I can only surmise at this point, but apparently ourexploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life form whichinfected and killed all personnel except myself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The location of the Romulan bases along the Neutral Zone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Leyor, the Federation would like to negotiate a trade agreementin which we could acquire your planet's rich deposits of trillium 323which we would add to our bid, Premier Bhavani. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could it have been a Klingon disruptor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Position? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: More than anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So long, Quark. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, we'll do it the old-fashioned way. Set a course forthe Federation, warp thirteen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. Come in, Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Return fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're right. It's difficult. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have no such intention, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was that which sent us back, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's nice to have you here, Ensign. There will be a briefing andindoctrination session in fifteen minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set automatic locking device. Alert Shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Likewise, Counsellor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But how do we get to it? I wouldn't want to try to transportthrough that much solid rock. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wish I knew what to tell them. Mister Data, can we stop theseincursions? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? I am Commander William T Riker. What is going on here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Recognise anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, it's just a game. A little friendly competition, You workup a sweat, you have a few laughs, and you make new friends. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fair enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding away to make the computer think someone else is Data? Maybe a fewsomeoneelse's? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keller, can you get to a Jeffries tube? Ensign Keller, answerme! <eos> <bos> RIKER: None. Why would they do that? We're allies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, but I think that you will. One way or another, it's going tocome down to you and me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kazago, you know who controls those spheres. Now I ask youagain, First Officer to First Officer. What's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is a result of the experimental interface? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm ready for that briefing whenever you are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander. Commander. A second ago I knew who I was. I wason the ship. I was in a play. And now I'm having trouble rememberinganything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To tell the truth, sir, it sounds to me like nonsense to me. Butconsidering <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only thing that's changed is you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset theincreased radiation and magnetic fields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Be ready to increase power in case we needit. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can see why your father wants to marry you off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly's play. Ever since I began rehearsing for the role, I'vebeen uneasy and restless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate a radio link to the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, transfer complete. We are ready to leave orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Believe me, it is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And for the Ornarans. Without the medicine, they would all die. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker, go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Respectfully, if I may suggest regardless of where they camefrom, they are here now and they need our help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But this won't be boring. If Q is anything, he's imaginative. Apparently our Captain wasn't meant to be with us here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, let's make a run for it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wanted to apologize for my remark in Ten Forward. Yourpersonal is none of my business. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Denied. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, but if Troi was right, we were veryclose to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I volunteer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have never seen humanoids with that power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how long will it take to get it all ready? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any requests tonight? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading anyfurther. But we still have alien symbols floating around on ourcomputer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen thesethings all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive andnon-functional. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He'll be here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't believe these simulations could be this real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set sub-warp speed for towing, LaForge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will check in on you later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rivan, Liator. Also from our vessel, Troi. LIATOR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data performs self diagnostic routines on a regular basis. Weshould take a look at his logs. They may reveal something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you ever wonder if we did the right thing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Identification? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This isn't real, either. What's happening to me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No help from their communications log. The Drake reportedarriving at Minos and then wasn't heard from again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, take him directly to Sickbay, and notify theCaptain once you're on board. Let's get to work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who's your superior officer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're a logistics officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suppose so. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, I'm puzzled about your reversing our course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their Bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record everything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gentlemen, we're giving you an assignment. One thing we don'twant to hear is that it is impossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, how believable do you find that crystal thing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Almost as much as I had to learn when I came aboard as CaptainPicard's first officer. A fact he reminded me of when I commented onwhat a pain in the neck you are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be fine. I've been preparing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Too slow to be a photon torpedo. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the one they've chosen is you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you can't stabilise the life support, we're going to have toevacuate the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You will be careful, sir <eos> <bos> RIKER: In what way? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Senior officers, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm asking you to leave, or I'll <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shield status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You really think Endar would go along with that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened to him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As I said, we're having trouble contacting you <eos> <bos> RIKER: I enjoy a challenge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Chocolate ice cream, chocolate fudge and chocolate chips. You'renot depressed, are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood, Captain. Doctor. Mister LaForge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Felis catus, is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermicquadruped, carnivorous by nature. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is Mister Barclay? It's past fourteen hundred hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley Crusher, this is Riker. Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only place we're going back to, sir, is bed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No idea. No one's filed a flight plan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Out, out! Let's go! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll let them know they can have more access to the lateralsensor grid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. You? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know how many of them there might be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Kolrami, when I agree to do something. I do it. Do youcare to surrender now, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Min! Minuet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The vessel appears to be intact. They have shields, but it lookslike their subspace systems are out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the transporter logs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That our computer was daydreaming? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Don't make me come after you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi did it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gladly, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

We'll start with that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mrs. Troi, since this obviously significant to you, I'll I'll carry it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course not. Pull up a chair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Inertial dampers compensating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Complete your scans, Data. Let's not stay any longer than wehave to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's called a Horga'hn. I don't think you'll have any troublefinding one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, you can't assume the intent was belligerent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's, that's not what I meant. I was sick when it happened. Iwasn't responsible for what I did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, now. Right away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even if we get the Sheliak to talk, they're not likely to beaccommodating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The play's not till tomorrow night. I've still got twenty fourhours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said that when I was able to accept what I'd done and Iunderstood the consequences of my actions, that I would be free to go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodationStarfleet has to offer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll begin our crew survey on decks five through ten. When youget those systems going, try to pull up the personnel files. It'd benice if we all had names. Right. Good luck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That will take us very close to the Neutral Zone, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you warn him before the attack was made? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Minister, we've been attempting to contact someone in yourgovernment. It appears that you have detained two of our officers. Wewould like to discuss the situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Verify these are accurate coordinatesfor New Providence colony. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and thesoul in my night. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole, Captain. I think he's the logical choice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just the same, let's keep the shields up for the time being. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We won't go back. You don't know what it's likein our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We'reone of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, sir, I find it hard to believe you're that good a singer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's not look for problems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The damn thing's feeding off our shields. Mister Data,remodulate our shield frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That can be arranged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Because they're not through coming after us. Wesley, Geordi,prepare to warp jump. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Data would have left a trace imprint when he beamed down? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: That could have just meant she was good at math. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have orders for me, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He'll need another thirty seconds before hecan restart. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. CRUSHER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, please report to the Observation lounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The shuttle doesn't have warp capability. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Destroy it! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All hands will stand to battle stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, all stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then try something else. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Access all available technical schematics on LieutenantCommander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Evasive manoeuvres, pattern Riker Alpha. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Belay that order. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Imagine the Ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm clear. Energise! <eos> <bos> RIKER: When is today's transport? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The test ship's warp field is becoming unstable. Sensors showmultiple disruptions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to cut the barge loose. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Response? <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for this. You release the command codes andwe'll talk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something, anything to can cut through thestorm. Some way to get a signal through to him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a Klingon delicacy. Pipius claw. This is heart of targ. This, of course, is gagh. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe by uncovering all this, we run the risk of upsetting thestalemate. Maybe we should leave well enough alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us to fifteen thousand metres, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. How can the Federation help influence yourchildren in your traditions? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's teasing. He wants us to reveal our tactics on his terms. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you'll excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One hundred twenty five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Once we realised that you were no longer onthe mercenary ship, we scanned the surface for your neural implant. Wetracked the signal into the caverns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf. In the meantime, takeus out of range. Ensign. Thrusters only, one hundred kph nice and easy <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security guard to the Engineering deck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I ask what the Captain decided? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It won't last long in that radiation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! <eos> <bos> RIKER: After what she did for us down there, that doesn't surprise meone bit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm going to have to leave for a while to see to my duties. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. You've been declared dead. You can't give ordersaround here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The joke is you. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wait a minute. Didn't your readings indicate a class M planetbefore we passed through the wormhole, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could put out a coded level two query to all Federationoutposts within the perimeter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From the smell of things, I'd say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, Troi and I will return to the Enterprise. When you'vereached a conclusion, you can contact us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Keller, answer me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold your position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But if you do anything foolish before that inquiry. it's notgoing to look good for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They claim to be our escort. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There will be members of this crew who willnot want to serve with Ensign Laren, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I take it the mind-meld was a success? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then let's set it and get going. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Number and type of ships, Mister Crusher? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then if we can learn nothing from you, we'll leave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stop it. Put that down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to fire. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: A shuttlecraft? Well, here's my offer. Instead of the ship, I'llgive you some time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How was the second pattern able to maintained its integrity? <eos> <bos> RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. Itcan be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The simulation begins in one hour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't want to leave without sayinggoodbye. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was walking along minding my own business, doing a simplegeological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To sleep? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Still no sign of them on long rangescanners. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we know who's on board? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll have to lower shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it's a vessel of the United Federation of Planets, and Earthis a member. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kelso, energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all. Hail Minister Lorin, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain, stay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not accusing you of anything, Mister Uxbridge. The attackingforce spared you for some reason. We'd like to know why. Now, may I goinside? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, Data, would you be all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Happened even more quickly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander. Captain's mess? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Describe it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am Commander William Riker of the USSEnterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But the holodeck can't create anything dangerous. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry, you heard the Captain. Duty calls. I guess we'll have todo this some other time. Captain's log, stardate 46307.2. We have just comeinto orbit of Tyrus Seven A to monitor progress on the Tyran particlefountain, a radically new mining technology. So far the project hasbeen fraught with problems, and is well behind schedule. Mister LaForge has been assigned to evaluate the situation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take him to your lab, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I wasn't aware you wanted to be informed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have no choice. Energise. I thought you said there were six. Where are the other two? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I see you in the Observation Lounge, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on a coursefor Lemma Two. However its velocity has increased to warp four pointone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: These are your quarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, am I under investigation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we need a working solution in aboutfive minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well. at this point, I'll try anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try a manual bypass of the damping systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Rikerat Farpoint Station. Standing byto beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bynars. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red Alert. Load torpedo bays. Set warhead yields to levelsixteen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To link artificial intelligencedirectly into the humanoid brain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It wasn't. There was a computer time lag, for one thing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Odd looking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you discussed this with Wyatt? I think you should. It'salso damned unfair to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell her no. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All sections ready to begin the survey, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's continuing to regenerate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another mask. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, break orbit. Full impulse. Captain's log, Stardate 43153.7. We are departingthe Rana system for Starbase One Three Three. We leave behind a beingof extraordinary power and conscience. I am not certain if he should bepraised or condemned. Only that he should be left alone. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

You either had very good instincts, or foreknowledgeof the Caldonian withdrawal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was found in our Captain's chest, which brought over from theStargazer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She could be a fake. We told him a member of our crew was fromthe colony. <eos> <bos> RIKER: May we have better luck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hold no malice toward my benefactors. They could not possibly know the hell they have put me through. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're with me, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I'm actually here to tell you that I've decided to cancelthe rest of your test. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have to tell them something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Electromagnetic field? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They tried to decommission her about five years ago. One of theadvantages of being an Admiral is you get to choose your own ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering to bridge, did you copy that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yankee traders. I like the sound of that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're running out of time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought Commander Data's expertise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean if I go back, only one of us can return? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought seven and eleven had value. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it were unable to reach warp speed, it would have taken allthese years to get here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is he? Where's Barclay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You just can't stay away from the big chair, can you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best to make a good impression, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Astounding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were having a few problems while <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very clear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's for a neighbour's child. Was there anything else found? Ihad one piece of jewelry, a metal pin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the Cardassians? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe wecould consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediateproblem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security personnel, full alert. Shut downall shuttlebays, transporters, and turbolifts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, would you explain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you have to admit that these could kill. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, you're familiar with this star system. You'll takethe conn. Is there a problem, Ensign? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: In the meantime? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all right. But Cabot should stay where he is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed onthis ship lately? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enough to turn them back, but not enough tohurt them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Disengage tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible! <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to saythat there's no real difference between them. Physically, men arebigger, stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs. Men can't bear young. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The port engine's down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're here, Mister Worf. Stand by to transport five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd be a fool to turn that promotion down, wouldn't I? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is Captain Picard? What have you donewith Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here's your twenty. Three hundred more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Outer hull breach. She must have had an internal explosion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engines? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you taking all these books? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everybody here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tried to tell who? Damn it, Data, what's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't accepted the assignment yet <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've noticed you're intrigued with her having securityresponsibilities. But these things are not at all unusual with us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Altered? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And who will tuck him in at night? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronicnet would ionise in no time. I can't let you sacrifice yourself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The preparation for the mission, the play, those were recentexperiences, fresh in my mind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's normal procedure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was hoping you might know his business partners. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps, Data, perhaps. Thank you <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Power transfer appears stable at this end, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll be protected on our ship. You could still be in dangerhere on Rana. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fajo spent more than half a day in orbit. Departed just overseven hours ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't forgotten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did Starfleet mention any Klingon ships in this sector? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got this one! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: His style of command is just different. Klingons believe inobedience and a strict formality of command. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If there were a way to save the Captain and Geordi withoutdestroying the exocomps, I would jump on it, but we have run out oftime and this is the only solution I've got. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our engines are new, sir. Top condition. The tests on thoseolder ships may have simply been to straighten out some engineinefficiency. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not the first bone I've ever broken. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No problem, Professor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Override them? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: We mean you no harm. We have injured crewmen in theshuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good idea. I've had enough surprises for one day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No argument? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No way, not me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got to figure out how we've handledthis before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Captain Riker of the Enterprise. That is, the Enterprisewhich is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantumanomaly. We think we have found a way to return all of us to our properrealities, but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certainquantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit that signature to younow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This seems brutal even for the Ferengi. Any sign of survivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beam him back as what? He's nothing but energy now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, maybe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Negative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A positronic brain. He promised so much. And then when he failedcompletely, Doctor Soong disappeared. Now we know he went somewhereelse to try a second time. Data, Geordi, we'll get a close look at thislab. You and Lieutenant Worf reconnoitre where these corridors lead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you understood any part of what he's tried to tell you? Humanity is no longer a savage race. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: You want to try again? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is ridiculous. A cell, a single cell. Let's check herquarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Problem, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The rules on this ship do not change just because Ro Larendecides they do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There must be other options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've lost our link, Captain.   <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Main Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously, Starfleet will want to know more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Was he bluffing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps you should. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is going on? Are you expecting someone? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then ask me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you werereferring to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't help but feel I should have come forward a long timeago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I doubt if they'll agree to that. But maybe if we tell themGeordi's dying, they would give us access to a medical kit. We might beable to use some of the tools to make a weapon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships rising on anintercept course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Listen, Miss <eos> <bos> RIKER: The son of a Klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade. True? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border. I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If shefinds out anything, I'll let you know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you'd be alone. Excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Begin power transfer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago. They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's recordsare virtually non-existent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to transporter room one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Step inside the transport area. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just had a feeling. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The place is called Risa, and believe me, Captain, it is aparadise. Warm tropical breezes, exotic food. Nothing to do but sitaround all day and enjoy the quiet. And then + <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's what I'm hoping you're going to find out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And in order to do that we're going to have to go down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. Sorry to interrupt, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The scan analysis you asked for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suppose it depends on how people perceive time. Everysituation is different. It depends on how you feel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What could be causing it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Forgive me, friend, but the stranger must be set free. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn it! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's why you set up the engine failure, because you knew thatI'd be able to fix it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does he have evidence? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously there's been some misunderstanding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking thedeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you met our Commander Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just don't want to believe it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did he mean, he picked the right day? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Resting in his quarters after ordering both of you to your dutystations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would be ideal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's far enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there some reason we shouldn't be? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may kick usout of the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well. I'm glad I ran into the two of you. When you have nomemory of who you are, or who anybody else is, you find yourself RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: This console has tactical configuration? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I could runit right now. I wouldn't have the same control that you have, but itwould still work. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room three, can you get a pattern lock on CommanderData, Counselor Troi <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you discussed this with him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. We're here on a mission of peace. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell. Nobody said life was safe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That sounds like the next logical step. Start with the mostcrucial areas. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Music lessons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's one option. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a large room up ahead called Ten Forward. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's wrong, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we need to shut down the particle fountain. What if wedetonated a low yield photon torpedo within the particle stream? Wouldn't that shut it down? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, analysis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We found the reason for the geologicalinstability. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, you've made your point. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We haven't got the power. Captain's log, supplemental. The life form, whichhas significantly increased in size, is again attempting to communicatewith us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you located the escape pod's landing point, Chief? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And that stopped his heart? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's no use. They've already adapted to the new frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mind if I join you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open a channel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, the Romulans want a confrontation specificallywith us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope your profit margin's pretty high forthis little adventure, because you're risking war with the Federation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep me informed. The sooner we find out what the Klingons thinkthey saw, the sooner we can get the hell out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There it is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Negative. There's no indication that he's left the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just windowdressing for a dead man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The entire Velara Three facility has been powered down, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increase to half impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All I know is when I go back to the ship, reality breaks apart. Nothing makes sense. And then when it's over, it fades away like adream. But when I'm in the hospital, everything here seems real and Iremember everything that happens here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give me everything you've got. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant La Forge says we will be able to engage the warpdrive within the hour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't. I am simply trying to help you understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what would make him change his mind? Why would he leave theship now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Seems to be exactly what's happening atthis hotel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That will all be up to the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No damage in Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I got out with the last of the colonists. Ifit hadn't been for the perimeter teams, none of us would have made it. We were able to clear out four of the teams, and the interferenceprevented us from getting two more. I don't know how they could havesurvived. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Normally? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Bridge. Captain, we're ready to beam it back to theplanet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't have put it exactly like that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, shall I send for Doctor Crusher? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A different rendezvous? I'm not sure I know what you mean. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Attention, crew of the Hathaway. This is your Captain. Overthe next two days, you might lose a lot of sleep, but with your skilland your stamina, we'll have this old lady ready to fly. I want hourlyprogress reports from all stations. Riker out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lower your shield! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, have you found it yet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not like him to the post. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someonetaking a shower in his or her clothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An appointment? No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Someone was here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try warp engines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No possible explanation at all? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, hear me! Look around you, the Ferengiare using their thought devices on you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You tormented them. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: You will lead it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am First Officer William Riker of the Enterprise. We'reresponding to your distress signal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There is the option. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes becausethey thought we were using it to spy on them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Back? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good luck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are no civilians among the Borg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You are holding our captain. I want him released. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Bartel, divert all power from auxiliary relay systemsto the manoeuvring thrusters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Intense storm activity over the southernpole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace ofthe Essex. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If the ship's records have been tampered with, then transporterrecords could have been changed as well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't transport him with the shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For both of you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You may want him here before we're done, sir. He seems to havedeveloped some sort of special attachment to the boy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's toward Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How soon do we get underway, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Please take that to Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we get him out of there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This just came in for you from Starfleet <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, belay that order! We want to get more insight intowhat's been troubling the poor man, remember? Quite a healthy fantasylife, wouldn't you say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know, I've been thinking we should probably let Dad knowwhat happened. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you want to take her into orbit, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: With a sixteen year gap in my head? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security to cargo bay eleven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't put it past them. I think we should prepare for thatcontingency. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I'd like to live in this place. A little stuffy formy taste. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They won't get the chance. We'll use the transporter in thatshuttle. We'll beam directly to the Observation lounge. Sorry aboutthis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf? Anybody?! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell happened here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Co-ordinates? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by. I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would anyone want to destroy all the life on an uninhabited,neutral planet with no strategic importance whatsoever? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, transfer command to Engineering. Full security alert! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure anyone can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hang on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The composition of the moon's crust is blocking the sensors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a tribute to your people that you were able to recover sorapidly from the Tarsian War. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coming about. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How can we do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's more than I expected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You, an expert in humanity? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: An emergency transponder? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah, I think I like it. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. Our Chief Engineer will beam over to help you. Close. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Heavy metals? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was in a hospital, then I was back on the Enterprise. I wasback at the hospital. I kept shifting from place to place. I couldn'ttell what was real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Until? Would you mind going over that again? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can count on all of us, sir. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reflection therapy, then. When do we begin? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, prepare to jettison the module. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We are on the Bridge. There's a good chance this is our ship. Looks like you're the leader. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, O'Brien and Troi tried to commandeer the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep me advised. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The mission with the Legarans cannot be carried out with Sarekin this condition! <eos> <bos> RIKER: How the hell did they find themselves on a deserted planet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And it showed up as an explosion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: With your permission, I'd like to look inside of the house. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And five years later, the away team that was investigating theirdisappearances have started to disappear themselves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's something the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes. Indubitably, Data has been studying him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I speak with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Alliance? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm trying to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we'll be arriving at the BorgolisNebula in three hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recommend we destroy the asteroid. It would take most of ourphoton torpedoes, but it would preclude any possibility of the Pegasusfalling into Romulan hands. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we're too late. The sisters have already been here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, extend shields! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Check and mate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even Danar can't move that fast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker. What are your intentions, CaptainEndar? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any insights? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock on photon torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to check it out. Has there been any word? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage forward shields thirty five percent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It won't happen again. We apologise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many people would it take to set that up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our new captain doesn't waste time. It's a good idea. Thank you,Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the custom here, running. Lead the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're picking up a signal, coordinates twoone one mark six one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. We're only making educated guesses about theirmotivations, no more than that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Next time, don't give up so easily. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Two, three days. Do you have to hold that thing that close? I'msorry. I've been on edge all day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency teams, stand by transporter rooms. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I think you should reconsider. The warship has comeafter us twice. It could come back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any ideas? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best to get it out of here as quickly as possible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shuttlebay two, open hangar door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm having a little debate with the colony's leader. Itseems <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Commander Data, you have the bridge. Ensign Crusher,you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Problem, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Garrett? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, have you got him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fascinating woman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you going to answer that, Commander? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why, what is this attitude? On Kabatris I had to wear furs tomeet the leadership council. And on Armus Nine I wore feathers. Thisobjection doesn't have anything to do with the fact that Beata is awoman, and an attractive one, does it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, you bringhim in here and ask him face to face. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? Captain, I've got you. It's all <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what can you tell me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A hot milk toddy? You're kidding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you honestly get the impression they could handle ourtechnical specifications? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Communications as long as conditions permit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And it weakened him, in some way leading to the incredible leapout here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. Thank you, Counsellor. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, Lieutenant Yar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can anyone else over there do it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: May I escort you, Miss Troi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's not much damage. It doesn't look like they wereinterested in the station, just the people. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you need, Q? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Imzadi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage reports ready for your review. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try the oskoid. Very different. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did you find? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Chief, do you have them? They're not here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you conscious? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, Amanda. You are so beautiful. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields up! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set course and speed for Star Station India. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm the photons, Mister Worf. Lock on thecentre of the vortex. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Save us some deep powder. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, is there any record anywhere of any occurrence evenvaguely similar to this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep it up, Lefler. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If the situation were different, I'd stay. But I can't. Notwhile he's aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. You have my coordinates, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Talk about going nowhere fast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Doctor Crusher, join me in Transporter room three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you at least show us a way into the compound? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Outpost Sierra Six confirms our readings,sir. They identify it as a Romulan scout ship. Bearing two seven zeromark one four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. Captain's log, stardate 42827.3. Commander Rikerhas reached the caverns, where he is making preparations to begin theevacuation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not possible. He's too far away for a positive lock. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been thinking maybe Doctor Marr is right. Maybe we shoulddestroy the Entity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Security! Red Alert! Restrain the Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe you'd like to do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Formidable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, discontinue radiation warning till further notice. It's all yours, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's an order. Return to the ship as soon as you're finished. I'll signal for transport as soon as I can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losingcontrol. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give us a superior curve, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana? Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's hard to accept. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd be more comfortable if you'd monitor our progress from theBridge, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suppose the warp coil. Before there was warp drive, humanswere confined to a single sector of the galaxy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've also seen it in what I can do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me get this straight. You think this thing was alive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not as a servant. I told you, I prefer equals. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Positronic brain of yours and carry outyour mission. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I'm just not right for this part. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's lying! That never happened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Celtris Three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no sign of any survivors. No sign of anyone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I have no family. I can't stay here. I have to get back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, Deanna, just what the hell is allthis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise now taking possession ofStargazer, Kazago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bet it all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could confine him to his quarters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Compliments of the Enterprise. It's called an Albenimeditation crystal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Would you care to join us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Crusher, send a general hail, all ships. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. Once more time. And again. How many cards? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good work, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't have a sword. <eos> <bos> RIKER:  <eos> <bos> RIKER: Both. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The man they knew as my father, the man who stands before them,both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's my only answer. Now if there's some other way we can helpyou. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where are we, Ensign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Romulan craft is a total loss. There'snothing there to salvage unless you want to use tweezers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on theirplanet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Certainly, history never meant for this ship to go into battlewithout her captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's normal procedure when entering into a suspicioussituation. It's not an act of aggression. The Enterprise will not firefirst. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Precisely, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, Mister O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you wish. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll do my best. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What he means is, what planet is this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's get to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Close the channel, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Had a small run-in with an aspiring sprinter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer. Locate Lieutenant Barclay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have beenfugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She left the dinner last night with one of the Ullians. I'lltalk to him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What negotiations? What treaty? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities given thecircumstances. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've heard better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At your age? You could break your neck! <eos> <bos> RIKER: The particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At warp six, we should be there in just over sixteen hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go, let's go. Keep moving. Deeper into the cave. Come on. Deeper into the cave. Keep moving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything has been programmed to operate onvoice command. you just tell the computer where you want to go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who is here with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up, maximum strength. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She knows her stuff. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drained and taken to Devidia Two for those aliens to ingest? Ifyou were a time traveller with a taste for human neural energy wherewould you get your supply? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Endure what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about Risa? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you run a diagnostic on the sensors, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My quarters are full of things that I suppose belong to both ofus. The least I could do is give you this. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Franklin's dead, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It comes down to this, Captain. We've learned everything we canfrom here, and we are no closer to understanding it than we were twelvehours ago. Manheim is unable to help us, but hopefully, having been agood scientist, he kept notes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right away, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who's in charge here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I sort of like it. I guess I'd better get going. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was worth it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your Honour, I offer in evidence prosecution's exhibit A, a rodof par-steel. Tensile strength, forty kilobars. Commander, would youbend that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It wasn't here before. This must have just happened recently. If we have to repair this conduit, we won't have time to access thatcomputer core. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course not. He must have seen me use the comm. panel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Wes? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, Geordi, Tasha. WORF <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beam over. We'll show you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare a scanner probe. Let's see what's in there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I understand, but there are other departments waiting to use thearray. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Life support has failed on decks seven andthirteen, sir. Now what if this thing manages to rewrite our entiresystem? It's so far beyond us that we don't have a hope ofunderstanding it, let alone controlling it. Our own ignorance couldkill us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me for being a little confused, Setal, but I thought youwere defecting. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not exactly. You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Thosevouchers are only good at your bar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To your success, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're on the visitors' list. You didn't know? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe I should take this to the authorities. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To smash your house of cards? No. It was the visual record of mywife, Minuet. Bad move. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if you did? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A Borg footprint? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No demands, no political statements, no theft. They must wantsomething. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Above, look out! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you say we, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fifty, right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You didn't say anything about a weapon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What a perfectly vicious little circle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If this is a Romulan ship, will it stay in position until weleave? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've lost our thrusters. Attempting to compensate withsecondary boosters <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we're being probed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll see, Counsellor. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Impossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lwaxana, Deanna. Anything I can do for you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I admit we withheld modern technology from some worlds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And absolute power corrupts absolutely. Do you believe I haven'tthought of that, Jean-Luc? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Junior adjutant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It could be one of those ships that was orbiting Dytallix. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't know that. Neither of us knows what happened after weleft. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are a lot of what appear to be experimental enginecomponents lying around over there. I'd say they were testing a newwarp drive design and it blew up in their faces. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you reviewed their laws. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had a change of profession. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. Commander, what is the capacity of your memory, andhow fast can you access information? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. She's a woman of very strongly held opinions, sir. What washer previous assignment? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lucky him. Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It will cut down their response time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My problem, Commander, is I expect to be notified before there'sa change in my orders. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Please bring my people here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing will change between us, will it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think that Devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean you change according to whatever man you're with? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So long, Ro. Take care of yourself. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when Acamar's medical database isonline. Riker out. Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status on the repair? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How specific? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Crusher, set in a course that follows those currents. Commander Shelby, prepare to initiate your plan to separate the saucersection when we find the Borg. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would never hurt you, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What have you got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very strange experience. Puzzling. I still can't comprehend howColonel Richey's vessel could have travelled out that far. Not on it'sown, at any rate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry to resort to such drastic measures, Minister, but youleft me little choice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, increase power to shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You may fire the probe when ready, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That should do it. All members of the Enterprise crew areaccounted for, Mister Conor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Glad to be of service, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When will the emissaries arrive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So the Sheliak weren't hallucinating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying that Worf's quantum signature is different fromours? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I want to talk about this now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: See if you can help shut down the plasma flow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's never late. Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locateLieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, I'll a projection of the radiation's impact on thecrew. Mister Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we won't bejoining the search for awhile. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not good enough. We need to knock out the scatteringfield in one shot and have the Captain back on the Enterprise beforethey know what happened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I won't. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not that easy. There are differences in the way that mypeople make love. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess we've piqued their interest now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: People don't just appear and disappear. There must be some wayto track her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data we've only seen the Crystalline Entity once before. How doyou know these metals will protect us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They seem to be in an awful hurry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated into the hivewithout any questions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You wouldn't have recognised her. Her dress, her hair,everything about her. I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been toanyone, but last night she was someone that I had never seen before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, this is sufficient evidence. Outposts have beendestroyed. Countless lives have been lost. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Other than the tetryon emissions in cargobay four, our internal sensors haven't recorded anything unusual in thepast three days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just met with the Captain about your mission recommendation. Iwould appreciate it if next time you came to me first. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Taris, prepare to receive a transmission from ourChief Engineer. He'll instruct you how to purge your system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How is he, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. Another time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, this is Commander Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. I'll catch up with you later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And my job is to see that this ship runs smoothly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's get the hell out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll talk to him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recognise it. This is Data's poetry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hang on! Come on, grab on. Come on! Come on, climb! Come on! I'm being pulled in. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm fine. I'm just <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Try narrowing the scan field. See if you can pick up anybiosigns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's happening, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Re-establish. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The cloak failed, and half the ship materialised in solid rock. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sure, why not. How did you learn todance so well? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well that eliminates the possibility of fate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, we're over the first hurdle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you fromviolating a treaty the Federation signed in good faith. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to transporter room three. Boost your output and lock onto the two Ferengi on board the shuttle. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had planned a ship's concert this evening. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assumingthat responsibility must by definition include the safety of thecaptain. I have no problem with following any rules you lay down, shortof compromising your safety. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a Federation ship. one three zero five dash E. It's theYamato, our sister ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Terrific. Find the Captain. He's in the Holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We send him over there for one set of repairs, now they need himfor more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Miridian six? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought thatwas uninhabited. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Unverified. The solar flares could have caused a malfunction inthe biofilter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your daughter? Nice to meet you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Historical. That's it. I remember I was reading a history of allthe past starships named Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've detected some sort of debris in a loose orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding, his bad disposition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would they go through the charade of needing our help? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Scotty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's in the case? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Every bit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could you join us on the Bridge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Atmospheric systems are down twenty sevenpercent. We're going below tolerable oxygen limits. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A new message from Karnas, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you think I'm coming down on you because the Captainoverruled me, think again. I happen to disagree with his decision, buthe is my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's noconfusion, I am your commanding officer and I expect you to do thesame. If you can't, there's no place for you on my away team. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, okay's not good enough. When I was your age, my own fatherhe wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wonderedwhat kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea evenscared me a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Goodnight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your empire fell prey to a supernova. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The power boost to the structural integrity field protected thenacelles. We used the inertial dampers to simulate complete shieldfailure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three. please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know Rebecca Smith? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can give it one more try. More than that, we won't haveenough power to get ourselves out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: From inside the Enterprise? You're sure? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I happen to be a good pilot, too. And I know my way around theStarfleet shuttle. So what if we team up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Joret will attempt to talk his way past the patrol. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status of Borg weapons? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Impossible. What about the fire aboard the Stargazer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're sure? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if I produced evidence that Captain Picard's log entry wasfalsified to indicate that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to execute that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why the past two years? <eos> <bos> RIKER: M-class. Nickel-iron core, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If not battle stations, may we at least take the ship to YellowAlert? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any hostile move on our part could jeopardise Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This must be the sign they were waiting for. Mister Data, youwill be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst. As soon asevery else is unconscious, I need you to get to the computer panel andstop that ship somehow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But it's what you've always wanted, Data, to become human. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're not in a position to dictate to anybody. She attacked twoFederation officers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, maybe if you get a little rest and came at this thingfresh. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their reason is part of their binary thinking. For them thereare only two choices. One or zero. Yes or no. Why did you lure me to the holodeck and hold methere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They may be here to help you. Don't be a fool! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, do you realise the position you're putting me in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Frozen? How? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's in that sector? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep it down, Geordi, for as long as you can. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Data, it was. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we don't get in that thing, I guarantee you don't either. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, notify the away team that we're going in ahead ofschedule. I'll tell the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You waiting for something? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by, forward phaser array. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No voice interface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only one who doesn't seem affected byall this is Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. Shields at maximum. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A couple of cracked ribs. She'll be all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You still wish you'd killed me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it big enough to cause a threat? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They will not go to war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Confused. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Spectacular. And a little terrifying. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Analysis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It'll be interesting to see how they improve a computer asadvanced as ours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley? Good. We'll need an extra hand around here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Just so you don't harm my son. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. It must be someone from either alien delegation. Now, ifthe Ferengi could have bought or bribed even one of them, that's allthat they'd need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What were you looking for? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've always wanted to see terraforming in operation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure Mister Data has a very good explanation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It certainly is. The good life, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. They can't fire when they're cloaked. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, of course. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Finish dealing the hand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You didn't have to. I knew. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can beam the table and torches down now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I promise you, Captain, they will never know that I am ill. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's impossible they could be draining all power from allsystems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've notified Starfleet that our survey of sector three seven six two eight will be delayed at least a week while we drop off survivors from the Denver. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Origin? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I'm not trying to put any pressure on you. I'm sure myreport will only underscore the need for continuedsupport of your research. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Will Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a fusion reactor in the house, good for another fiveyears of power. But theirwater table is tainted. They have nothing to feed themselves except fora small garden. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is the nature of your mission? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess you're surprised to see me, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or it may be out there waiting for us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander Riker of the Enterprise. Do you hear me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our speed is down by twenty two percent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was all that about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, because it's polite. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're establishing the link right now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The other members of the Q continuum kicked you out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I agree, Captain. They have not responded. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, the Black Cluster is distorting the sensors. We'repicking up echoes of the Enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their last message said they were attempting to crash land on one of the planets in the Mericor system. We should arrive in just under seven hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's allthis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi's found something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody apromotion and call it a night, Commander? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, Geordi is trying a neutrino infusion. It may smother the reaction. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Starfleet does. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader ofanother world. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wonder, Captain. I'm not usually one for distrust at firstsight, but this may be an exception. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You mean besides pride. Well, in this case it doesn't matter. Iprobably haven't got a chance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status of Borg power drive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by to fire, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When we're through here, re-check the sensor logs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Clear the cargo. Beam it to a hold. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all the power that MacDuff had to alter our brain chemistryand manipulate the computers, it's hard to believe he needed theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously nothing we have now can stop them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's got to be a better way to deal with it than this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I just needed some air. I can only take so much of these socialfunctions, and then I need to breathe a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Amazing. I never thought I would ever see a Romulan ship. Notthis close. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You know the inquiry's just a formality, and Captain Picard willdo everything he can for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your honour, there is only one issue, and one relevant piece ofevidence. I call Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's one hell of a thunderstorm. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I actually thought I might go with the name Thomas. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Horatio? Isn't that Walker Keel's ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I haven't given up yet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the first bad play I've seen you make. If you can bringhappiness into Deanna's life, nothing would please me more. You know,you're really not such a bad sort, Ral, except you don't have anyvalues, beyond the value of today's bid, that is. Deanna is just thewoman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence, if you're smartenough to take it. I doubt that you are. To the last mile. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Transporter Chief. Do we have ourpeople on sensors yet? CHIEF <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. One to beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course I know who I am. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theUSS Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had an agreement. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have trouble believing it myself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could leave the child here. If Data's right, it would have anample supply of food. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, no more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? What is he doing it for then? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, take a look at this. These are thecoordinates of the eruptions, and these are the coordinates of thephaser drilling sites. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any indication of the probe's energy source,Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Getting sensor readings. They're unconscious but they're alive. Stand by. I'm going to transport them over here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is this a test also? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The image of Rice has been replaced by something which ishovering several metres away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then do it. Deanna, help him. I want something by oh ninehundred hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You hate them as much as they hate you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you waiting for? Answer it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hi. I'm sorry to just stop by like this but there's somethingI'd like to talk to you about. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: All found in an open locker? I don't think he was too concernedwith security. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Actually, they think highly of us, Tasha. We have a quality ofgrowth which they admire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell are they doing in a Federation sector? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, Doctor, they'll be at theirdestination in less than a minute. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Because nobody's ever done it before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which you'll beam over next to the entityLORE <eos> <bos> RIKER: As a matter of fact, it was Baran who sent me here. He told meto pretend to be friendly with you and help you organise a mutiny, sohe can determine who your supporters in the crew and then eliminatethem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: See you on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This could be a prelude to an invasion. But who's behind it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm cancelling the test. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Science Station, analyse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not that I know of. I'd be more than willing to put it behindme. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It might be wise to put some distance between us before weinitiate warp drive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tog must have missed that chapter in the Ferengi book ofEtiquette. Enterprise? Must be too far out ofrange. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're out-manned, you're out-gunned, you're out-equipped. Whatelse have you got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where would you say we are now, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've received word from Ambassador Mauric. He's ready to see you and Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer. JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's more than ill, she's in a coma. Doctor Crusher doesn'tknow what's causing it or how to treat her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If that's the best they can do, this should last about fiveminutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: War over what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The weapon systems? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate search of grid one six three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. Medical assistance to the Bridge! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No objection. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No unnecessary risks. Clear? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Romulan disruptor fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many people were assigned to this outpost? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile. Who knows, we could all end up that way some day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, get these men back to the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will not surrender the secrets of the Enterprise to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiatehimself to me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'd like to move the generator back to the Enterprise forreplication. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cargo has been loaded and is secure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this? You said death. Is this poison? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, Mister Worf? I have a special mission for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did you know, sir? I feel like such an idiot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And that if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean, it wouldfall off the edge of the world? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are we still docked at the starbase? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't consider even one survivor petty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've been able to determine, you andyour wife and this house are all that survived that attack. That's waseither a bizarre coincidence or by design, and I don't favour thecoincidence theory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Out of the goodness of your heart. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: An entire planet obliterated except for a few acres of trees andgrass and one building? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been on my own since I was fifteen. I can take care ofmyself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Start firing countdown from twenty four. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. After I've served for six months, I'm eligible tobring family aboard. If we got married <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, Worf, you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I busted a rib. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You bet I'm agitated. I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'mnot insane. And there isn't any. There isn't. There's nothing. 'm sorry. Could we go back to 'you're becoming agitated'? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you explain why they're pulling us along with them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beat. You wouldn't believe the dreams I was having. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Klingons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's coming back with us one way or another. Set phasers onmaximum stun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert! All hands to battle stations. Layin a course. Engage warp nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I remember a certain junior officer meeting a very seriouspsychologist. The best part about being assigned to Betazed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Too real. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Mister Data, get us back online. Geordi, try boosting the power to the LU bands. McKnight, increase thedistance between the Enterprise and the shuttle. We're going to needsome more room to make manual adjustments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's good to see you, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You always had an advantage. A little bit of control of everysituation. That must have been a very safe position to be in. To behonest, I'd always thought there was something a little tooaristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. As if your human side wasn'tquite good enough for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have always tried to keep an open mind, not to judge someone else's culture by my own, but for me to be a part of this ceremony. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, where are you going? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is the source of the probe? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How well do you know Spock? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your mother. She's worried about you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All stop, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing. Nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Out of the question. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc, isn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you had compensated for that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Be ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. Counsellor, twenty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think we're going to make it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recommend that I return to the cruiser with an away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain and I, along with seven others managed to get to theescape pod before the breach became critical. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The soonest we could intercept? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess we're fortunate you had any at all, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Now, you're frustrated because you not only can't see thesolution, you can't even define the problem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phasers on stun. Ready when you are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had enough of this. I want you to take a message back toyour people. You tell them the Federation is willing to negotiate forthe release of Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Life signs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lotmore than she bargained for. Maintain Red Alert. Try to keep thoseshields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go take a look, fast! <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're certainly being thorough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Finally. Riker. Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, lay in a course to the nearest Starbase. Warp six. Captain's log, stardate 46001.3. Everyone whoshould be in the nineteenth century is safely there, and those whoshould be in the twenty fourth are here. Mister Data has been restoredto us, head and all, and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was tohave written after our encounter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How did you? Where did you come from? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Recognise those markings, Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just down this corridor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you open it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It depends how they get along. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Didn't I just say that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There is nothing more important than this, son. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, take us to the designated coordinates. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Firing photon torpedoes. Full spread. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have complete confidence in Mister Data's ability to check upon himself. Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all part of being in Starfleet. There. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well Mister Potts, why don't we start at the beginning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you give us any more, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Helm, bring her round one hundred and eighty degrees. Geordi,get us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, Tog! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think that's the case here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Maintain <eos> <bos> RIKER: Check him out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, project his new course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've got to be around here somewhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, evacuate Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How many guards in the shuttlebay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring us in closer, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry if she troubled you, sir. I have already informed her <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is? Then the Drake has not been destroyed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell was that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, you know if you do that in Parrises Squares you lose therhythm of the game. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of coldthat's coming. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Those are my orders, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It obviously wasn't pilot's error. I think it demands a responsefrom us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Ro, what's the closest we come to the Cardassian borderon our current heading to Valo Three? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: We appear to be on a course for Tambor Beta six. It's a whitedwarf star. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shelby, report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That means it doesn't have much range. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you see Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll do our best. 1 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Two Til'amin froths, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No one has ever offered to turn me into a god before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you have a lot to learn, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. You don't know how many times I thought about you,about us. For weeks after the evacuation, I kept thinking they'd find away through the distortion field and come back for me. I even thoughtwe'd meet on Risa like we planned. But days went by and nobody came. Then I realised why. They thought that I had been killed in the beamout. No one came down because they thought there was no one to comedown for. So I figured that they'd had a memorial service for me. Somehow that made me feel better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make that on the same starship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everybody up here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What kind of services? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You brought us here, you exposed us to them, and you cost us thelives of our shipmates Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but we need our Chief Engineer back on board our ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You escaped? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi is trying to stabilise the unit now. Wewill stay as long as possible. There are thousands of people in thearea. If that reactor goes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange an away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've traced the shuttle's energy signature to this point on thesurface but there's too much interference to scan the location. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's worse than we suspected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise, Get to yourtransporter pad and. No, forget about that. Lock on to any life formyou can find and get them over now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll check it out. Mister Worf. Doctor Pulaski, join us inTransporter room three for an away detail. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard evasive manoeuvre. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Strongly emphasized. And you can see it in the precise,ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lieutenant Yar too,sir, but maybe we should sit and wait them out. Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full dayof waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether theyare aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we havepinpointed Lutan's government compound. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Time to impact? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've also ordered a standing Yellow Alert. All Federation and allied outposts have been warned. Ops will continueto monitor long range sensors. I've assigned Data, La Forge and MisterCrusher to work with Commander Shelby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep trying. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I'll just have to muddle through. So forgive me if a strayhe or she slips by, okay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's going to have a great time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Carving us up like a roast. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you know that's impossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twenty two minutes if they stay at current speed. If we can'tbring them out of warp, we'll do as much damage as we can before wehave to disengage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exactly the same as Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're on our way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, any progress identifying the probe? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We wait. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I'll say this for him. He's sure of himself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed, Shuttle One. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, neither am I. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've never come out this far before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Absolutely, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship isfalling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty fiveminutes, holodeck and all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think anyone would object to our arriving ahead ofschedule? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure as hell not going to beam up whatever might be downthere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. It's a five minute countdown. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage control teams, deck fourteen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sure, Kolrami is the best ever at Strategema. Just to get toplay him is a privilege. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The cargo bays. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: or that you might think that was a line. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vulcan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can continue to bypass the part of the computer that'saffected, but if the nanites are spreading through the whole the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suggest you drop it, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: These mission details could have been transmitted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure yet. Why, are you interested? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. I'd like that very much. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Luxurious is more like it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Ensign Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd like to discuss this with the Captain. Take Ishara down tosee Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They'll learn and adapt. If Danilo Odell's any indication,they'll be running this place inside of a week. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And it paid off. He received the top grade and now that sametest has four options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Four years. Ever since Captain Picard was killed in the incidentwith the Borg. You don't remember any of this, do you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why is there no record of other future historians travellingback to witness important events? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why a shuttlecraft? Why wouldn't he just beam over? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It appears they're trying their best. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Klingons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will we be able to talk to you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As soon as it's convenient Captain, I want a meeting with youand your Bridge staff. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We should call Starbase 74, and see if anyone can decipher this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible. It's like looking into infinity, sir. Remember thecourse in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? About the time menstill believed the Earth was flat? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data. You're my First Officer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You weren't kidding, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so circumspect? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, what is the power efficiency of the wave? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We should be. We're on a reverse course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report. I don'tknow what you got away with at your last posting, but this is theEnterprise. We set a different standard here. Understood? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Yar. Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you make balso tonic? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's how it seemed to all of us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In time for what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? Captain, are you all right? Captain, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data! Carmen! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come now, Locutus. If Picard's knowledge and experience is partof you, then you know I've never lied to him. You should alsoimplicitly trust me, is that not so? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, it was dark. I couldn't see beyond the table. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Coast? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something jabbed me here in the calf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, wait. Let me get this straight. Deanna was impregnated by bywhat? Doctor, what do the tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge, on the double. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf's what? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Me? Forget about me. How are you? No word, no message, nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't believe me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nope. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think it's just trying to make contact with us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That sounds like good news. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently some of them were apparentlyblown out the emergency hatches. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So we just sit here and watch our ship disintegrate around us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We think your system contains one of these null pockets. Ifwe're right, the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy fromanything that entered it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We received yourdistress call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, I'm not fit to resume command. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. I want to talk about this now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why not Dixieland? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about Geordi and Worf? Were theyinfected too? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They send out a plea for help, then they cut off transmission sothey can't tell if there's any help on the way. Doesn't make muchsense, does it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, something's got me! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's why I'm here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Finished, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not exactly a welcome mat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Bridge will be fine, since I've called the entire staff. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data to the Bridge immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, arm phasers and photon torpedoes. Prepare to fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beverly thinks Alkar must have been at asusceptible point in the meditation ceremony. He was vulnerable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rice! Where did you come from? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What can we do to stop the overload? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what is bothering you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, it's time to set a course for Parliament. Warpeight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data believes that by sending Worf back through the fissureagain, it would return us all to our proper realities. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You claim to be an advanced society, and yet you resort toexecutions in order to suppress those who don't share your views. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computers have always impressed me with their ability to takeorders. I'm not nearly as convinces of their ability to creatively givethem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then they'll be able to tell what's going on. Analysis, MisterWorf. What the hell is going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who would cause devastation on that order? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're all very proud of her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's just designed to be an exercise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why don't I talk to Commander La Forge in Engineering and we'llsee what we can do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just human nature, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Is that possible, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The T9 energy converter has been beamed aboard and secured, sir. The Ferengi complained bitterly, but one final roar from Portalconvinced them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That may not be Lieutenant Uhnari. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have a saboteur aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're saying we're going to stall the Hathaway? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare tofire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With this power drain we can't delay. Now, I'd like someadditional help in case we run into trouble. Can you spare Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hardly the response we expected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, may I suggest you take this up with Admiral <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hypothetically speaking. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I did. He just didn't like what I had to say. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're holding position in the Argaya System. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can't both be telling the truth. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what do we do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want to be able to pull him out ofthere in case we have to. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was set to level ten. Standard procedure requires that allphasers are set on level one when they're in storage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, other than a question about the Ares's First Officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So that's what this is all about. What did you do with thescience team that was on the surface? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: First, molecular biology. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Staff's waiting, if Doctor Crusher approves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the more aggressive and dangerous they become. I think it'stime we set some limits. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've regained magnification of the life form. It's divided again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, probably true. She'll be difficult to forget. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Our feelings are what make us all human. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's too heavy. I've got to find something to help us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a Federation shuttlecraft, all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe you did that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Think about it, Mister Potts. And while you're at it, thinkabout what may have happened had we not been this close to a starbasemedical facility. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, let's give it a try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? Are they willing to go or not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He tells a hell of a story. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've cloaked themselves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I have. It wasn't easy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold off. Impossible, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold your speed, Captain Okona. Disengage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting that we warp over to Starfleet headquartersand demand to know what's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cause? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant. This couldn't have waited a moment? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll see, won't we? <eos> <bos> RIKER: At once, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fleming on long range sensors, approximatelyzero point three light years away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Quantum Mechanics doesn't want to give him up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The sensors? They've been scanning that comet for the pasteighteen hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. I'm here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're in position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that what you want? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. Say, I was wondering if you could tell me <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wantsanswered. He suggests that I take you with me on the away team thatI'll be leading. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Suggest it would be safer, sir, to have the Ferengi herewhatever happenings. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was afraid you were going to say something like that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Books. A novel. Hotel Royale? Summarise, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Theirs was armed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All hands, this is Commander Riker. We are about to engageimpulse engines for a short burst. Inertial dampers are on manual. Theymay not fully compensate for acceleration. So brace yourselves. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How concentrated is the activity? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status report, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there a way to locate those coordinates? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do it, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Including you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will they still be able to dissipate the wave? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My pleasure, Doctor. Wes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've had three security teams search deck seven. They couldn'tfind anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yuta. Move away from Chorgan. Do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke themin others. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's true. It sees with its sensors, it talks with itscommunications systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could his death have left some sort of empathic echo? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I won't let him blow this ship into space. If I can set up a lowlevel comm. link between the two ships, I can use my personal commandcodes. I can deactivate the shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Increasing power to the shields. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, fire phasers on full with a simultaneous spreadof torpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we have a confrontation, I don't want a crew fighting theBorg at the same time they're fighting their own fatigue. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, let's spread out. Twenty five metre radius. Ourwindow back closes in twelve minutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which was? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Transporter Chief. Pick up thecoordinates of the bell jar in the Medical Lab for return to VelaraThree. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In that dream they gave me drugs. Didn't anybody at the theatresee anything strange happen during the performance? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you tried the intercom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, launch another probe. Patch the monitor through to themain viewer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe that's the problem. I'm too comfortable here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: By all means. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Mister Worf. We have an obligation to render aid. Report to the transporter Room with all necessary gear. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Follow him. Let's go! Come on, come on! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's it doing? Checking us out? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope they're good feelings. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It would help to accelerate the process. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hide? Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. The beard is an ancient andproud tradition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be. Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chanceor intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out ofnowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The game isn't big enough unless it scares you a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain. Captain, if he's not open to evidence in ourfavour, where will you go from there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't take that much expertise to repair a servo link. Youand I can handle it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if hecan start dating his sister. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stardrive section only? What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're still fascinated with the human past? Perhaps you're notthat original. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: I told you, he's in the holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I could lose it in a minute. I've just gotten used to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You make it sound poetic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Direct all evacuees to decks nine and ten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. The Captain's hurt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've never heard of Paul Manheim. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something's happening. They're leaving. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're out. We got through. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not now, Kazago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need more than speculation, Mister Data. We need to know who,what, where, when and why, or we may be going to war. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'd better get going. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look at this, we've all got three of a kind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're pushing away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready, Lieutenant Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How soon before the deflector's ready? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything. A fingernail, a hair. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields are at forty percent. We can manoeuvre on impulse, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. I'll see you later) <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, Counsellor, but you must. We needmore information. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The crew might still be alive. There's no way we can tell fromup here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't give the alien any more time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't need explanations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it's artificial, then we're talking about sabotage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything on that design, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. Get ready to deploy the mines. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can send one of our own shuttles, but its energy would alsobe absorbed. Our Chief Engineer is working on a way to maintain thepower reserves long enough to rescue your crew. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi? The moon's trajectory? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You sure? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not surprised. How did you respond? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We know that you're involved. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We didn't anticipate that somebody would be living there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Generator's right over there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Data. Are you there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe it's my music. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and armthe photontorpedoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what are you doing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is a knockout like you doing in acomputer generated gin joint like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how far and how fast can that transport ship travel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't. I won't. Data's my comrade. We have served together. Inot only respect him, I consider him my friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well <eos> <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. Enterprise out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, we haven't been able to raise them since the initialcontact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Kelso. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I know, but I think it's about time we all sat downtogether and tried to work this out. I have Ambassador Mauric here <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not very friendly, are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you wish to evacuate any non-essential personnel to theEnterprise, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In fairness? You disrupt this ship, you kidnap the Captain. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by to dock. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! That's an order. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was the last one out. The distortion field must haveinterfered with the transport. They lost their signal lock on me. WhenI tried to contact the ship, I couldn't get through the interference. If you check with Starfleet I'm sure they will have recorded that I waslost on that day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you establish a reading? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll arrange for our guests to beam down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a Starfleet craft. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess the trip Pacifica will have to wait. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no way we can override. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you track the source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Weapons. power, communications. We're being stripped one systemat a time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess it's better to be lucky than good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They must have been forced to abandon the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You control my every move, tell me what tosay, what to think. What to eat, what to say. What to think, what toeat. Then when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap medown, inject me with drugs, call it a treatment. I may be surrounded byinsanity, but I am not insane. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's hope they stay clear of the colony. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A personal briefing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'll get only one shot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which is? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice shooting. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, but I want you in and out of there as quickly aspossible. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's still no indication that he's found the beacon, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll all be dead anyway. Just need a few more seconds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I could go a lot longer without hearing it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Beam him aboard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just don't be late for your shift. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Going to secondary systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I may. After this tour, I may have some worthy questions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to let this thing keep drilling into him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You taught me that word means my beloved. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you warn me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will miss you, Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was as if he was blaming me for something. This wasn't theonly incident. The last several days, I've felt like everybody'sstaring at me or talking about me. It's as if I was in Frame of Mind. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why hasn't anybody discovered this before? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought there were only going to be two of you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've found something else. A novel by ToddMatthews, entitled Hotel Royale, which is the name of this structure. Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were there, all dressed in black. Very flattering on you,by the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no power on this entire deck, yet somehow these monitorsare working. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no way to know. Let's hope he can come part way himself. Troi, is there any way you can get a message to him? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How was the racquetball? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about flooding their air vents with anaesthezine gas? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. With your permission, I've decided to stay on board theEnterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the same Ferengi vessel that entered the Corridor a weekago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What Federation starship was closest toKhitomer at the time of the attack? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Anything else? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? How terrible for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate,fully trained in many areas including shuttles. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We shouldn't have any trouble going higher. The safety overridewill kick in at about ninety eight percent tolerance, and that'lldisengage the interface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter Room, this is Commander Riker. Beam up four at myco-ordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you talking about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Because you're the property of the Sovereign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Susanna, report. Fan out. Let's find her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have enough information at this point <eos> <bos> RIKER: Careful, the next rock is loose! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very good, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Seems after hailing him for three days, he could've found aminute to talk to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Murder? Now wait a minute, you can't come on <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could she be another refugee from the Qcontinuum? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, you're not. You've been working for six hours straight. You're tired. Take a break. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam over. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To their cloning lab. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need to know if there are other survivors on the surface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay with them, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have to assume one thing, sir. Wherever Data may be, he'sdoing the same thing we are, which is trying to get to the bottom ofthis. He may have a better idea about what's going on than we do, so itmight be in the best interests of this mission to find him. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If he's dangerous. If. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, if you take the Bridge Officer's test, you'll have mycomplete support. But as First Officer, I'll be the one judging yourperformance, and you should know I am a pretty tough judge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangleLORE <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are they still alive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't need to tell you thatinsubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's all this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who gave that command? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wanted to give you something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you all right? Did the shielding work? <eos> <bos> RIKER: One of them referred to himself as I. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something straightforward, like disarm yourweapons systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's get him out of there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But still, to seal someone inside a class eight Probe and launchit off. It's a hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam andfiring on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm bettingthey're not going to push it that far. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Apgar. If you're prepared to getstarted, so are we. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from thesame clan. What does that tell us, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready for duty, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign. You're dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you got them, O'Brien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If this timetable is correct, we could get an indication ofsomething very soon. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have any idea what condition the shuttle crew is in, sowe'll all beam directly to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want to beable to pull them out of there at a moment's notice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive and take ourchances. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bravo! <eos> <bos> RIKER: The computer still isn't working properly. I can't get a visualof your mother. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the myth. Somehow, as the legend goes, the Aldeans wereable to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders, andother hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up in herefor days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,what to think, what to say. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Young Mister Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So Klingons did board the station? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any way to get through to them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Leijten, Geordi, check out the shuttle. Data, Worf,you've got the perimeter. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Subversion? Personally, I don't believe this conspiracy theory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riva's not what I expected. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Okona, if you follow Commander Data, you can get startedright away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He is busy elsewhere, ma'am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's athletically inclined, loves to climb mountain. He's fromsomewhere called Alaska. He enjoys exotic food, and takes his vacationson a planet called Risa. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For once he and I agree on something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've been down here dozens of times. I'm sure you know thebest way. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: If the timing is precise, it's possible to beam through and ontothe planet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's just a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise'll beback tomorrow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you made your nine year old brother believe that he'd killedyou? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All those years. That's why I never won. You were cheating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We can reach that in forty two hours at maximum warp, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, I know for a fact that you never attended that tournamentand that no shuttlecraft has left the Enterprise for over a month. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the Fleming? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think he's a plant to draw us into the Neutral Zone. Thenwe'll look like the aggressors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take aninventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that'susable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believeit's even less likely there's anyone living here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Full scan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prove it. Return our man to us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just one question. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Congratulations, sir! <eos> <bos> RIKER: There she is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does this ionisation pose a threat to Mister Barclay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She seemed very sure that she was making theright choice. I think her only real regret was that she let you down. Here's my report. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Somebody hit me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right, there is. You could spend the next monthmemorising all the technical manuals in the computer, I still don'tthink you'd pass the test. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic,risking literally everything in the face of our superior power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My mother died when I was a baby. All I have is pictures, andthe stories that my father used to tell me about her. I begged him totell those stories over and over. When I was five and I went to school,I started to tell my new friends those same stories, pretending thatshe was alive. Then I started believing that she was alive, that she'djust gone away, that she was coming back. The teacher got wind of this,and she and my father had this talk with me. They told me it wasimportant to accept the fact that my mother was dead and that shewasn't coming back. And all the hoping in the world wouldn't make itso. In my mind, that was the day that my mother actually died. I criedall that night. But after that, it started feeling better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standing by, sir. Captain's log, stardate 46735.2. Our frequent useof high warp over the last few days has overextended the propulsionsystems. We are finishing minor repairs before returning to Federationterritory. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Family emergency. You don't look like aperson who came here to relax. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where did these nodes come from? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Barclay! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Rocha's file is spotless. Two decorationsfor valour, three outstanding evaluations from his previous commanders. Doesn't sound like the same man that Lieutenant Uhnari described. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. Leave it, I'll take a look at it later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now let's see if we can get this ship to go where we want. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are they responding to our hails, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well why don't you turn it off? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, that's where the emitters come in. We shoot out a seriesof photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears. From that we should get a fairly complete outline. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Counsellor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Trouble. Captain's log, supplemental. While on a mission torescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team hasencountered a strange creature which seems able to assume differentforms, including one which resembles humanoid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You think? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No cards? The best poker face I've ever seen. Dealer takes two. Your three and ten more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. And in that discussion, I <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not unlike commanding a starship, Mister Ral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it trying to communicate? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. I'll send those vouchers to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And are you saying that this belief will eventually become areligion? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you want to make sure that doesn't happen again, you'd betterre-initiate your regulator sub-compressors. A full diagnostic of yourintermix chamber wouldn't hurt either. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What can you tell us about this device? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, allow me to present SpecialFederation Emissary K'Ehleyr. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In accord with the Prime Directive, I've allowed them to holdhim pending the outcome of this. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The treaty is the only thing that preventedthem from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I didn't. He came on board the Enterprise to brief me when I wasoffered the Aries. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have no right to be there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On second thought, Trent, we would behonoured to witness your moral imperative in action. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long will the transport window be open? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll pass along your request. If you'll excuse us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not much on pleasantries, is he? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, give me a location on Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Parrises squares? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maximum impulse velocity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring us right into the edge of it, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've arrived at Ramatis Three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Move us to within forty thousand kilometres. Match velocity. Commence arming sequence. Increase deflector modulation to upperfrequency band. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. Data, I gave you direct orders to get to NeutralZone immediately. Explain the delay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bonus? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Venom all over the ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dealer folds. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship. Now, come on, Iwant to see exactly what's happening. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Radiation danger? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's it! I can see that diplomacy is not going to get usanywhere today, and I do not have time for to negotiate. So let's putall of our cards on the table. You're concerned the Kes are going to beadmitted to the Federation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your name? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, analyse signal <eos> <bos> RIKER: Identical to the ones on the space vessel lifeform over there. Why was it punishing you, Groppler? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like hell! You're a damn thief! <eos> <bos> RIKER: It can't hurt you to listen, can it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Sheliak have not attempted to communicate with theFederation for a hundred and eleven years. Why are they doing it now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why not? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready phasers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You couldn't see two metres in front of yourself down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our intentions have not changed, Endar. We're returning him toStarfleet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any passages leading to the surface? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean, Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you'd find the tools we use rather unusual, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And the reason Odan refused the transporter? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The hotel gets bought? By whom? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They were fast, aggressive, almost vicious. it was more like fighting Klingons than Borg. No offence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I just opened them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet, exactly as Iwould for any woman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. He will triumph who knows when to fight and when notto fight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All decks prepare for radiation protocol. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You are my friend, and in spite of everything I've said, if it were my place, I would probably help you. But I've been studying Klingon ritual and Klingon law, and I've discovered that it's not my place to fill that role. According to tradition, that honour falls to a family member. Preferably the oldest son. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you know my name? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. A Ferengi cargo ship that went down in the Hanolinasteroid belt. The debris was spread over a hundred square kilometres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right. That still hurts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't look natural. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They might have attacked before we got here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's all right, sir, I'll see that he leaves immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What ship were you on? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry I missed it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now you do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He could be hurt. Maybe he can't respond. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, report to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire all weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. They stayed in the freighterRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Time? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, Data's going down to join you down there. Be my guest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An incoming message. Code Forty Seven, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How are the surface winds, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Velocity to one half metre per second. Adjust pitch angle,negative three degrees. Watch your roll angle, conn. All stations,prepare for reconnection. Thrusters to station keeping. All velocityzero. Her inertia should do the job now. Lock up now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've said all I can. I am under direct orders from AdmiralPressman not to discuss this, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Crusher, we've rendezvoused with the Merrimack. Please report to transporter room two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I will not break any vow I have taken in the past. I have alsotaken an oath a loyalty to your ship. I will not break that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data will need access to your library. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, give us a visual. Magnification factorfifty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How would Starfleet judge me if I didn't? An entire Earth colonydid disappear down there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't there something you can do to counteract it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But Captain <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've already got all the players you need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if the Ferengi also realise the forcefield emanates from theplanet, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we areexploring the unknown. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're lying, Setal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, may I speak frankly? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data? I understand he's somewhere on this deck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? I feel fine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ready, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lowering shields. Engage tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is now. You're about to commit a murder. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another ship from Atlec? <eos> <bos> RIKER: They couldn't have adapted that quickly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you tell what's there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You must understand, whoever I seem to be, I am Odan, who lovedyou. That has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that. If thiscauses you pain, I will suppress it, I will keep my distance. DoctorBeverly, I would never hurt you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Cancel red alert. Clearly I need to be briefed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Remember, I'm the one who wanted to make Captain by the time Iwas thirty five. I'm a little behind schedule, I'll admit that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It worked. The shields are dropping. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, we fix the shields first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now do you see why it's funny? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right here. That was close. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ninety eight? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Define weird. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your head is not an artefact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Those Ferengi have iron jaws. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Definitely. Keep me posted? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry. Be prepared to take command. Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deuce. Six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything status quo, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One photon torpedo ought to do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe you just need to sit and talk with her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't carry money. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Dix, but our two passengers have awakened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is a violation of protocol. Crewmembers should not besimulated in the holodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't believe how stupid I was. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The nodes are deactivating all over theship. Our systems are beginning to function normally again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm going back to the nineteenth century to get the Captain. Doctor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't have time for these games. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Problem? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How could you get an empathic impression from an empty room? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you fell in love? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Family. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, who programmed the new coordinates? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wasn't ready to leave here anyway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You do now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not if we can help it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf! Where are you Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We may surprise you in a lot of ways. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what are you suggesting? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You need rest, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, at least that's something. What have you got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Superior? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I'm right, you're not really here. This isn't a real phaser. It's all a fantasy, and I'm going to end it, no matter what it takes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The coroner saidthis is where they kept all the cholera victims. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why didn't you let us know about it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No reason. I've worked out the new rotation schedules. I'd likeyou to cross-check the personnel assignments. Notify the departmentheads. Your Bridge shift begins at twenty three hundred hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Repair teams to Engineering. Seal hull breach. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf isn't dying and he is not in pain. He could live a long life <eos> <bos> RIKER: You haven't heard my offer. Half a gram of Anjoran biomimeticgel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Connecting two points through subspace? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf? Anybody? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bringing it here personally, perhaps with the idea of being onhand for the Ferengi beam over, might have imperiled this vessel had itbeen something hostile approaching. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It looks if half the ship materialised inside solid rock. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on the mission itinerary <eos> <bos> RIKER: That may explain some of the familiar feelings we have. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And when we don't accept their offer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That! Geordi! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, if we project our course beyond the rendezvouscoordinates, what lies ahead? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by to lock phasers on target. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I'm familiar with most Earth codes, and <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know, sir. It sounds like your voice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe he just wants a big laugh. He'll take Bre'el Four to theedge of disaster, and then pull the moon back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the nature of the problem, Captain? We've lost visual. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe we can accommodate your wishes. We'll rearrange thesuite assignments. If you'll follow me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And just as the headsman swings his axe, theblade is about to fall <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. It smells like a trap. Let's go. Captain's log, stardate 41503.7. We have enteredthe Neutral Zone, where a Talarian freighter has been severely damagedin a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we go to warp? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My condolences. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I really have to leave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get him out of here. Confine them both to their quarters. Put aguard on their door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take it. How'd you know I was bluffing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep the shields down. We don't want to appear provocative. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry if I <eos> <bos> RIKER: You might want to have a look at this, Captain. Could be a linkto the disappearance of the colonists. It was displayed in the lab, nodoubt by proud parents. It could be just a child's imagination, butseveral children did similar drawings. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll bet they are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Daren. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any signs of mental stress or trauma? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any response to our hails, Mister Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Report to Shuttlebay two immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've shown none of the concern that Captain Picard would forthe safety of his ship, the welfare of his crew. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is Commander William T. Riker, Federation starshipEnterprise. I know this may seem an unusual way <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, indeed. With his mother gone, who will see to his studies? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Armed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, like you said, our choices are very limited.  RIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everyone is so concerned about my next job. With all duerespect, Commander, sir, my career plans are my own business, and noone else's. But it's nice to know I'll have a few options. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They've broken through a security field,deck ten, section two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could transfer the away team right into this intersection. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Enjoy yourself. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need you to send us your shuttlecraft Curie. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A long way from home. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, we deactivated you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, but she's not the Enterprise. With all due respect, sir,you need me. Particularly now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't have a psychology degree, but if you'd like to talk? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exactly what does that mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, with that holodeck we just saw. I think I could conjure upan interestingprogramme or two. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. I'm looking for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Ensign, lay in a course for Indri Eight, warp seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nor ours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long does he have? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's she doing on that ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All senior staff report to the Observation Lounge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you read that, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? Data, are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We know you're behind this, Q. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is different than I remember. The place was a mess when weleft. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. Part of this mission is diplomatic. I have requestedan audience with a head of state, and I will honour her by wearingindigenous apparel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's heading toward Federation space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I told you, they're here to help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well let me put it another way. Will he survive long enough totell us what he was doing here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You said you were trying to get to the weapons locker. Is therea possibilitythat you did? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think it might have something to do with ego? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Which begins to explain what happened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You needed me, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Jellico. We've arrived at the shuttledeparture coordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed, shuttle five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your captain is under attack. Drop your particle field. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it my imagination, or is something bothering the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're better than good. Great. Brilliant. It's going to be fun. Carry on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We've entered thestructure. Riker to Enterprise, come in. Come in, Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is the planet's distortion field re-phasing sooner than wepredicted? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're coming through clearly now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge. I'll check in on you later. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have saved your life twice already, Galen. I would think you'dbegin to show some gratitude by now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're worried. They're worried because we've got access toPicard. Mister Data, we have two minutes to figure out what we can dowith it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set course for Beta Kupsic. That is still our destination? Velocity, warp factor five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: One Klingon bird of prey off the starboard bow. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll stay here. PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our friend is back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's a man who lives his life by his own rules. He does what hedoes by choice. By his choice. Someday you'll make yours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I see you've done some redecorating. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by. Stay here and cover La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any recommendations? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recommend we fire directional phasers at those coordinates. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I saw him on the ship too. I also saw him here in the hospital,but I don't know who he is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I don't get the command computer back online soon, none ofthis, whatever this is, won't matter. We'll all be dead. Captain's log, supplemental. It is no longer aninconvenient, childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victimof the Tsiolkovsky infection, is now in control of my starship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may kick usout of the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf! What happened? Where's the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess we really are different. I never really cared for thatname. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can't we block them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's really been stripped down, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give us a tight visual, Data. Is it my imagination or does itlook a lot meaner this time? Shields up. Weapons ready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As your read out shows, this is anunusual place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I must speak to you privately now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could use our phasers as a scalpel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What exactly does this device do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep trying, O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My leg's still asleep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Caution? What's wrong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Detail? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe you're right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the experiment? Do you think we're going to find thattoo? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Let's do it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. Whenyou've settled in, we can complete our briefing. Have Security arrange an escort for this gentleman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This air's pretty stale. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us intothe crash. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very good. Very good indeed. Now I'll need someone to play with. A trio. Piano, bass and drums, and a 'bone for me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Baby? This is a surprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, you're with me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Over here, Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you're not comfortable with that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc Picard? You know the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is it a wild theory, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maintain shields at full intensity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have no other choice. We have to try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's causing it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, lights up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll bring her home, Wes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could be he's planning to enter shuttlebay two from outside theEnterprise, bypassing the security guards. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Should you be beaming down there alone, unarmed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's go. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were right, Captain, we've got company. Cardassians. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can't be serious. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you communicate with him, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was just one hell of a storm. It moved in on our positionfaster than anything I've ever seen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You did it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about plain old basic sex? You must have some need forthat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At what coordinates? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever that alien probe did to him,Barclay now seems to know more about the internal workings of theEnterprise than anyone else on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want to be in the transporter room to greet her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The archive just activated some kind of tractor beam, sir. We'renot able to disengage it. ]PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. We have an open channel. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Follow me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your shields were failing, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Warp speed, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's just a toy. I was taking home as a present. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think, I don't remember. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we transport him out of there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, I have a suggestion. There's a piece of equipment inAdmiral Pressman's quarters under guard which might get us out of here. It's a prototype for a Federation cloaking device. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's do it. Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I cheat. I'm kidding. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Blood? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we're still looking at a corebreach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The problem is, Imzadi, I couldn't. Not now. Call it an oldEarth tradition, habit of the beasts, whatever. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With pleasure, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's a chance that our doctors can do something. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You look pretty good for someone who's been eating sickbay food for three days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, how are you coming with the surveypreparations? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Moriarty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're not staying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: These enemies are Klingons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If it was Outpost twenty three you were after, why didn't youuse your neural scanners to probe my mind? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or a probe. Making them powerless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I heard another Rossa was killed in action at the Krasneroutpost. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Resume one third impulse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow usout of the way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

A terrible mistake. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When do we leave? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're still at the altered heading, Captain, holding at warpnine point three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was on the Bridge. The ship was at yellow alert. We wererunning some tests on the engines. Something went wrong. There was anexplosion in Engineering. Heavy casualties. In the midst of thiscrisis, the First Officer, the Chief of Engineering and most of Bridgecrew mutinied against Captain Pressman. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to idle, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is thus area secure? Can we talk? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay. For two days I've been trying to construct sentenceswithout personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? It? To us,that's rude. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on your planet? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pinocchio is broken. Its strings have been cut. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the source? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As First Officer, I should be informed. I should know everythingthat you know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If only one of his thrusters was out, he could still have setdown somewhere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you and Ro. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A man more interested in Krieger waves than in a lovely womanlike you. How is that possible? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, we're in position. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're ten years older. A man. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, maybe not acting is what causes the destruction ofmankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and youweren't there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, <eos> <bos> RIKER: Solid propellant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Come on, keep moving! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes.. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think the Captain understands that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Even at warp nine we wouldn't get there for another twentyminutes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I want Mister Clemens kept under escort at all times. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They would get even younger. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not what happened. I was the last one out and I made itback to the Potemkin. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've already assigned them to the away team. And I'll be withyou as well, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold. Irealised we had arrived before they had completed the transfer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I guess a frontal assault is unwarranted. Stay here. I thinkI'll try an old-fashioned knock on the door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, Captain. It's going to be okay. Here we go. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have to find a way to penetrate the forcefield around TenForward. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Know some blues? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. Commander <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's coming. The Arcos crewmen may require immediate medicalassistance. Phasers on maximum stun. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a risk I think we have to take. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is something important supposed to be happening here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And others of your kind have the same ability? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our own way out of here, you've succeeded,Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why were you in stasis? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened, Tasha? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The calm before the storm? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, isn't that something? My father's were the same way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir, it is. But as they say, sir, you're the Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very nice. I'd better get back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it needs a little more help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The positive side of that is the information they have about usis also out of date. Captain, I think it's that lack of informationthat this is all about. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Picard, this is Riker. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't imagine war ever feels right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will someone answer that damn ringing! Captain, the ringing isgetting worse. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything I wanted? You probed the Enterprise. You lured ushere so you could play games with me. I didn't want that, you did. Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't really match the outfit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure Captain Picard would have something meaningful andinspirational to say right now. To tell you the truth, I wish he werehere, because I'd like to hear it too. I know how difficult thistransition has been for all of you. I can take over for him, but Icould never replace Captain Picard. Nor would I ever try. Whatever theoutcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify hisfaith in all of us. Dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what if we re-connect their command pathways and we givethem a choice? You've assumed the exocomps would shut down beforeaccepting this mission. What if we ask them if they are willing toproceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And you, sir, are listed as <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maintain the approach attitude, Data. I'm taking her in. Bracefor impact. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything? Then why did you kidnap me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academycredit for your work here. I don't think you have anything to worryabout. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests toquarters. Not too close to mine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, are we going to have those shields anytime soon? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shades of Gulliver's Travels. He actually meant it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extractit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Trent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously we've underestimated their technology, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, it's far more likely that I am a weather balloon than analien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well. I have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can I help you, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It looks like it's back into that dress uniform, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have any idea who was behind the attack? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you seeing anything? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf,prepare to return fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Settle in. I'll meet you on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good luck, Will. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When you figure it out, you'll understand command. I'm on myway. I hope I've been able to help. You let me know what you decide? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're transporting endangered animals from Corvan Two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry they startled you, Mrs. Troi. They're Antedeandelegates. They're being stored here temporarily. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's try it. Mister Crusher, realign for polar orbit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I believe it may have happened before. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Should we tell her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you suggesting they be transferred tothe Enterprise? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Meaning? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you're just the person I need to talk to, clear somethingup. It's my understanding that one of the duties of the First Officerof a Klingon ship is to assassinate his Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's a musician, for one thing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tactical? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll come back during the third window, We'll bring a new EPScoupling and try to access the core from another console up here. Rikerto Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll do my pre-flight once I'm on board. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothingwrong. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would prefer it if Lieutenant Worf and I were able to asecurity sweep of the ship first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set a course, Ensign. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You won't need that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You should be getting somethingRIKER <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Alaska. I was nine years old. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, from what I've seen of our guests, there's not much toredeem them. It makes one wonder how our species survived thetwenty-first century. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Earth. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you know who any of these people are? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Frankly, Lieutenant, I don't think that's realistic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The firomactal drive is powered byPICARD JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Q? Any idea what he's up to? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I'll have to go down there alone, undercover. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This ought to be easy for someone written up in bio-mechanicaltexts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is gold. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not that far gone, am I? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Position security teams at both entrances. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed to second phase, Commander Shelby. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It could have been hidden anywhere in that room. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good thing we didn't bring Data. We'd be unscrambling hiscircuits for a week. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! No, don't! <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're absolutely right, Doctor. Right now, I can't imagine everhurting anybody. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lock phasers on target. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, you know why. I don't belong here. I have to get back onmy ship, in space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set them on stun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here's the situation on El-Adrel. The entityhas moved off several hundred metres. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's not enough time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, if you'd like my opinion <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd be having more fun than searching the ship, I'd imagine. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now that's a compliment, Q. But that's not an answer. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You come from a very brave and unique people. I'm glad you'rewith us on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set a course to intercept. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Enterprise. This is CounsellorTroi, Lieutenant Yar, Lieutenant La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All stop. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Cardassian ship is powering its weapons and it'stransporters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try. TenForward. Our mistake. Remaining transporter functions are beingtransferred to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's only one reason he chose cargo bay four. If it becomesnecessary, Ensign, you will blow the cargo bay hatch on my orders. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Their defences apparently prevent deep strikes into each other'sterritory. Minor skirmishes are all that's left. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Since you've fulfilled your agreement, Captain, can we nowbeam the vaccine aboard? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The transfer's been complete. Doctor Pulaski is being shown toher quarters. We're ready to get underway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were there in the cavern. You know what happened. What am Isupposed to do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Already been taken care of. She's transporting over at oh sevenhundred. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could some kind of damping field have caused us to losevelocity? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonistson visual. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Welcome back, Mister Data. Are you all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So you think that Rocha was killed by one of these organisms? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No sign of intelligence, no brain as we know it, yet evidence ofthought, Mister Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the explanation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could be a ship's log recorder, or a probe casing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The engine's been off a little over threehours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your engines have engaged, haven't they, Ensign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It may be quite a while before the emissaries arrive. They'll bemore cautious after the last incident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Yes, there was a sound. Computer, there were noises comingfrom the darkness. Strange, like whispering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why would they want to take a Federation hostage? Their fightdoesn't involve us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now it's time for the long pants. There's your ten, and onehundred. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What brings you so far from home? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I know this must be disturbing, Governor,but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan. Ihave his skills, his thoughts, his memories. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Barclay. I thought it would be fatal if you left theholodeck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Chief Engineer. It still has a nice ring to it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The lives of fifteen thousand people areriding on you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Talk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yeah. I'm sure it did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Collapsing protostars sometimes emit E-band bursts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a pity we can't take them ourselves. Having them on boardis like a visit from the past. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Empire knows that we'd never allow them to maintain a basewithin the Neutral Zone. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What do you make of it, La Forge? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now, we don't want to lose you. You're a very good officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's the Brittain, all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, who leads when you dance? If you dance. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, butfrankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closedtheir borders to all Federation starships. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon system, even in acomputer mock-up, can't hope to defeat the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain. Starship Victory has arrived. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who are you? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: From the size and shape of the wreckage, it appeared to be somekind of escape pod. Their control system was badly damaged, which isprobably what caused the crash. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander William Riker, Doctor Pulaski, Lieutenant Worf. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome, I'm sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Alert science stations to standby. Tell them to coordinate allefforts with Commander Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But, sir <eos> <bos> RIKER: Close call. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. It's kind of you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tilonus Four? Didn't their government justcollapse? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In my opinion, that's the only choice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what's causing it to move? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another Romulan? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's the specs that Kosinski sent us. In my opinion, sir,they're gibberish. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I need some information about a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It wassent to you a few years ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have beentampered with, and we are close to Klingon space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, you've got ten minutes. That's it. If you meet anybody butSarjenka <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is our mission? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: I beg your pardon, Ensign. I didn't quite catch that. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any indication to how long we can keep them like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: TV? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Shelby, take an away team and confirm that the Borgare asleep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've entered the first system. I think youmight want to come to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, report to Transporter room three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: See if you can trace and locate Bok's ship. Geordi, are youready down there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Exactly the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she letsyou know what's on hers. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get him to a detention cell. Set phasers on maximum stun. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damn it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wasn't playing Parrises Squares. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something wrong? I asked a question. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Dismissed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we gain control of her systems remotely, we could activatethe viewscreen. That way we could at least look at the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The sooner the better. Enterprise, we have an injury. TransportSoren directly to Sickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Little change, Captain. Our shields are still inoperable. Wehave partial control of our weapons, and I've doubled the repair crews. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I refuse to believe you ever said that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: None, usually. This one's been fitted with two type-four phaseremitters. We'll use those to chart the null space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We don't know much about what happened either. Apparently yousaved an entire village from radiation poisoning. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, they're going to be here any minute. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Louder. Faster. More of them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Stargazer, please respond. Enterprise to Captain Picard aboard Stargazer. Please answer. MisterData, what was Stargazer's condition? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And he was? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, believe me. This has been a terrible mistake. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm afraid I can't tell you that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She gets a full head of steam, doesn't she. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe they should, Data. Maybe if we felt the loss of any lifeas keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, human historywould be a lot less bloody. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor Two, sir. See what'sout there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We wish to end the hostilities. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Professor Galen contacted me from his shuttle an hour ago. Hesuggested that we surprise you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Twin brothers? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: That was his plan all along. First officer's log, supplemental. We arecontinuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escapeof the Angosian prisoner, Danar. He is still at large. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The warp reactor core? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you determine which of the comm. links is connected to thePrime Minister's office? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no evidence either way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In fact, we have no idea where it is. We thought the last knowncoordinates were a reasonably good place to start. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Keep me posted. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Engineering, status report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, what have we got? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're having trouble contacting your government directly. We hadto start somewhere. If you would let me talk to your <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lathal Bine. It was your aunt who represented Beta thirty yearsago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our efforts with the Prytt just ran into a wall. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm having trouble concentrating myself. It's like my mind keepswandering. I can't <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think it would be nice if you took us back to Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But we are on the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, our communicators are out too. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, we won't go back! <eos> <bos> RIKER: If he rigged it, could you prove it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No! <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Borg could have downloaded the codes from Data's positronicnet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. What do you think? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Suggesting? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to back to the ship. Let me know as soon as you havesomething. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation StarshipEnterprise. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our sensors indicate that you're carrying magnesite ore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look, I'll review the situation and let you know as soon as Ican. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will it be good enough? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're leaving the ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there anything like this on record? <eos> <bos> RIKER: In your sector? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Worf, he's in Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We need warp power now! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, get that beam back. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was looking for Doctor Crusher. I didn't know what nutrientsshe wanted to send with the bacilli. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stand by for subwarp. Head for standard orbit of Data's planet. I wonder why Data hasn't come up here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can be. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor array. Wedon't want a ghost tailing us all the way to T'lli Beta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Begin day watch. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just a little weak and light-headed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right, everybody. Back off, back off. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, I know this much. We can't avoid the future. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what scared her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were never too hurt for anything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you think we'll need to put in to a starbase? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's worth a look. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. BA'EL <eos> <bos> RIKER: While these things are being checked, permission to leave theBridge, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The cloak appears to be functioning normally. The ship'smatter-energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through theasteroid. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's very kind, Ambassador. But I don't think anyone hereholds you or the Kes government responsible for what's happened. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very well, I'll inform the Captain. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I tend to agree with Mister Worf, Captain. I think we shouldlimit their access while they're on board. They don't need to have therun of the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi! Geordi! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ambassador, I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us withmore information. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have some holodecks which you might enjoy. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, we're still here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sir, I think I'll stay and give her some help. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're growing. Something about us compels us to learn, explore. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think eitherof these phenomena could produce enough of them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, I'll do everything in my power to make this as painlessas possible for both of us. Do you assist your husband in his work? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You pull as many people off the surface asyou can and get back to the transwarp conduit. The Captain's orderswere to get the Enterprise back to Federation space. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Something I can take care of for you on Starbase Five One Five? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Barclay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: As you say, Captain. Riker to La Forge,return to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Okay, specialist, what's our sensor status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room, beam one to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sure he'll be thrilled to know there are two of us now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll check in with you later. 1 <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's wrong? JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Permission to speak freely, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Crusher. Actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our computer banks are non-negotiable. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And how are your friends, Keiko, Guinan and Ro? JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now we know what triggered the SOS. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to getunderway. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's infected with <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thirteen sixty five baker. That should putus right behind shuttlebay two. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not supposed to happen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With all due respect, sir, we've already run into one dead end. Indri Eight doesn't seem much more promising. And we're late for theconference on Atalia Seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My girl. What's a knockout like you doing in acomputer-generated gin joint like this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mauric is determined to take his protest tothe Federation Council, but I don't think he'll get very far. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds like it might be an SOS. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Allowing them access to our computer is a complete breech ofStarfleet security. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll only need few minutes, Mister Worf, because you're goingto prepare another surprise for them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope some day that the Federation and Daled Four will haveformal contact. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Course to Station McKinley ready and laid in, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Survivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The life signs seem to be coming fromthe far side of Engineering. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suppose you mean that as a compliment, Q. Or maybe it's mylimited mind. But to become a part of you? I don't even like you. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Will you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why her? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: When I used it before, what happened? I saved most of our Bridgecrew. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't believe you're willing to sacrifice Captain Picard'slife as a negotiating tactic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Allow us transport Lieutenant La Forgeimmediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard, this is Minuet. Minuet, Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What made you change your mind, Hugh? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't make any sense. Why would they run into us? And ifthey were, why wouldn't they do it at full speed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge, you've got ten minutes. Mister Worf, Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could return him to the crash site. We'd have to remove hismemory of being on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's over two sectors away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It would be more accurate to say he was discussing them with me. He's the best barber in Starfleet. What can you do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like intoxication, but worse. Judgment almost completelyimpaired, <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mistress Ariel, I hear the words but not the sincerity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do you know <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do they open the conduits? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Couldn't we replicate the elements that Tyken used? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Here we go. On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now more than ever. Deanna, facing death is the ultimate test ofcharacter. I don't want to die, but if I have to, I'd like to do itwith a little pride. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get us out of here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You think our visitors pose a threat? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sick of this game. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aquiel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Jev, I'm not accusing you of anything. Did she mention feelingill? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could that be leakage from their engines? <eos> <bos> RIKER: My insides are still shaking, but I'm all right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks to me like you need a break. Unwind a little. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Get away from me! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Or that you might think that was a line. <eos> <bos> RIKER: To be honest, I can't think of a good reason. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The injured Borg immediately self-destructed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, I'm looking forward to proving my innocence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, locate Lieutenant <eos> <bos> RIKER: Isn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your twenty and I'll raise you fifty. You're going to call mybluff, aren't you. I think I'll quit while I'm ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We still have the problem of retrieving the database. Thecomputer on the station is not completely operational. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, one of the specimens is growing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Possibly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, if she was married to me, she had to be patient. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are yourparents now? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign, prepare to put us in orbit above those coordinates. Captain Picard to the Bridge, please. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there a problem, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Picard. We are approaching Indri Eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Drugs. They injected me with me drugs. See if the drug's in mysystem. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what happened to the Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: La Forge? Initiate stabilisation procedure! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Babyface. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, you beat him! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll introduce you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He calls that a little adventure? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Stop, Mister Worf! That is an order! <eos> <bos> RIKER: She's gone. I tried variations of theprogramme, others appeared, but not Minuet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So what's the point? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, bet it all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Incredible, Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any word from the Jaradans? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell them to stand by. If this works, we'll be on our way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened back there, Ensign? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We would like to get out of here. Now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm photon torpedoes and stand by, Mister Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He speaks forty languages? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The remains of another ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sit down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, prepare to activate gamma pulse generators. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you absolutely certain, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you believe that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It was never the Romulans. It was you allalong, wasn't it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Apparently some time last night. That's why I wanted to talk toyou. You may have been the last person to see her. Did you go with herinto her quarters? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sorry ladies. Duty calls. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Just take twelve point five million, the purchase price of thishotel. Spread the rest around. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'd better take a look. What kind of vessel is she? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. What should I choose? Computer, I'd like some placeto play some music. A little atmosphere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That probe is doing something to him. Anything yet, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Three weeks away, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire up the engines. Half impulse until we clear the nebula,then punch it to warp nine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, seen this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I think you'd be better at something like that. Or Beverly. Sheknew him the longest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yet this hole has a form, Data. It has height, width. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're in stasis. Medical team to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've got just the thing. Why don't you join me in Ten Forward? There's something I'd like you to try. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Certainly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't understand. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Surely you don't want to remain here? How can you take care ofyourselves? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You don't sound very confident. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ten. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this foranything. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know why we're going to this pulsar. And creeping up on it at half impulse makes even less sense. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Our missions are always inherently dangerous, and any of uscould be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: She seems too delicate for such a task. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Multiple phaser shots, Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reroute systems to primary hull power sources. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Assemble an away team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Weapons status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And it's delicious. Thank you. Good morning, Groppler Zorn. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This doesn't make any sense. Locking the unit in a diagnosticmode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer. Why wouldanyone want to <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aeons. Have you any idea how far we'll advance? Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Come on, Data, hurry. Ship's log, First Officer Riker. Enterprise will bedestroyed unless it can be moved out of thepath of the star material hurtling toward us. Our only hope is forLieutenant Commander Data, in the time we have left, to regainhis senses and reconnect engine power to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Toxic? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Too bad. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we'll search them again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It'll take forty eight hours for a message to get to Starfleeton subspace frequency. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set to kill. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I recognise it, sir. It's the crystal image Lore described. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They were so small, and they lasted only a second. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Sounds like a plan. Lets get started. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll take a shuttle in. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can't pilot a shuttle you're not familiar with. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. Activating power systems. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What about the lateral sensors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. we're going to need to do a room to room search. Worf, you and Corelki start searching the north wing. You and I willtake the south. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So, son, how are you? JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: And they call that a small demonstration? <eos> <bos> RIKER: For following my orders so precisely,Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Once we restore the servo link, you canshunt the database up to this console. Are you ready, Commander Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax theembouchure. Don't use any muscles you don't need. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How is it moving, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Really? Then I guess adding one more charge wouldn't hurt. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people, but we must haveyour answer within eight hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when you're ready. Ensign, takeus to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were worried about you. I should have known you'd pop up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you open a channel? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Young Wesley, he'd been manning that station for me. I forgot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold position here until we can get our bearings. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's going on? <eos> <bos> RIKER: First officer to Enterprise. We've lost Zorn. Something like atransporter beam seems to have snatched him away. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf! <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have your orders, Lieutenant. Carry them out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Enterprise? my son you created it all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Duras or Gowron? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Point five four parsecs from our original position. Almost aday's travel in just thirty seconds? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The transmission <eos> <bos> RIKER: But the probability of making a six is no greater than that ofrolling a seven. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I see. I have no choice but to agree. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are some residual traces. It seems there were emissions upuntil a few minutes ago. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, can you take the engines offline? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, but I'm sure Mister Data knows what he's doing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, God, no. I came that close to winning, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does that mean he'll be able to <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter code fourteen? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Removed from command, sir. Placed under guard for his actof personal vengeance. Seems there was no profit in it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior tous? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Data, I don't know if you've had a chance to meet ourhost, Commander Hutchinson. Call him Hutch. Lieutenant Commander Data,our second officer. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've just got to tie in Geordi's atmospheric sensors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're far more charitable than I would have been, Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Understood, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint forDoctor Quaice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know who any of you are. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to beam up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the latest on the Enterprise'smedical situation? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What was that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Pick three more. Okay, now pick one of those. Is that your card? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Not only are they closely humanoid, but their historyhas remarkable similarities to ours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're going to explore the rest of the hotel. We'll keep a comm. line open. You two go down to the lobby and see if there's anythingthat we've missed. You talk to the guests and try to find out who orwhat they are. I'll check out the rest of the floors. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He needs another fifty seconds for the core to cool down beforeit can restart. <eos> <bos> RIKER: When not to duck would be more accurate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Wesley! <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was thinking the same thing about you. In all my dealings withKlingons, including our Lieutenant Worf, the thought never occurred tome of Klingons laughing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, Doctor Marr, report to the Bridgeimmediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. All personnel report to duty stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge, sir. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't want to hear that, Commander. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions fromthe null pocket and shut it down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bring her round to two seven five mark three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We have a limited, two-second warp capability. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Set main viewer on that tangent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No wider than a proton but with gravitational fields as powerfulas a black hole. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In his quarters? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, we were just discussing the situation we're all in. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: About one hundred metres apart. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The servo-link must be damaged. We're going to have to gounder the station and access the core directly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have my word. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Well, that'll change your point of view. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're welcome. I'm not sure which one to feel sorry for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not that I can remember. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Damage report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd better get over with a team. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Make that we. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, Data has found something interesting. The Aldean shieldgives evidence of random fluctuations, weakening its structure inisolated sections. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It doesn't sound like you care for that option. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yep. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could probably scare up seven, maybe eight, more ships. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You stopped them. You gave us our shot. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I take it the Sheliak just hung up on us again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's down on that planet waiting for us to come back. It killedTasha and it could have killed us, but it didn't. Deanna and Ben arealive for a reason, and it knows we're not going anywhere as long asthey're still alive. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Who did you intend to send, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why does the scanner read her as a human? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Five, and twenty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've trying to scan it, but it's we're running into lot ofinterference. It's going to take some time. JR <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what the hell do the sensors say? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where do you think he's headed? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're right, I won't. But I'm going to find out what's real andwhat's not. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've received an emergency transmissionfrom the science station on Ventax Two, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Take us up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who are you? Captain's log, supplemental. It is now six hourssince our away team beamed down to the planet surface. On theEnterprise, our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, withreserve power alone, we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding has closed down all engines and is draining ourreserve power too. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've taken the Engineering qualification three times. You'reno closer to passing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: An experiment, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are they? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Problem, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Estimated time to structural failure. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, stand by. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aboard the Stargazer, sir. The sphere you destroyed, it'sbeen controlling your <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Worf, I'd like a security detail to accompany the awayteam to the surface. I'll lead the team. Geordi, you're with me. MisterData, you have the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I have a request, sir. I would like to conduct an investigationinto Captain Picard's death. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Daren has already requested extra time on the mainsensor array. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start? Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours. I'm having trouble waking up. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ferengi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not now. When it doesn't interfere with myduties, Remmick. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Riker here, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Standard security sweep shows nothing out ofthe ordinary. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's all just sit down and try to talk about what's happened toCaptain Picard and Doctor Crusher. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a littlelater, sir. Right now, gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and Iwill tell Lieutenant McDowell about the probe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Borg seem to be using theircombined power to repair the ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Never cared for it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go to yellow alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They'll be back. As I said, I figured you wouldn't take no foranswer. But I thought you had more sense than to send adefenceless ship across the border into hostile territory with noescort. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Fine. I'd like to see him, immediately. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We had to respond to the threat from the core fragment didn'twe? <eos> <bos> RIKER: A grandfather? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Palmer is missing. A scan of the planet shows Mintakan lifeforms only, no humans. However <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's twenty years too late. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't know. They don't usually go through the ceremony if it'sjust a temporary assignment. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You can call it whatever you like. The fact remains youdeliberately disguised your probes. You made them look like signalmarkers. You hid them in debris field. You mined the Corridor. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Put it on screen. Scan for magnesite in its hold. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let me get this straight. You want me to take off your head? <eos> <bos> RIKER: You've seen something as fresh and tasty as meat, butinorganically materialised out of patterns used by our transporters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've practised in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing. Here's your hundred and twenty more. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're heading for the Cordannas system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought it was more important that the Romulans <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is Soren? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It'll take a few days before you know whereeverything is. If you need any help, you just use one of these comm. panels. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could you be more specific? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And are these gentlemen the Bynars? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise aman like Rice would have reported again. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever's blocking our scanners willprevent the use of the transporters. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. No weapons. We don't want them to think they're underattack. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'd better get to the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor Apgar, I'm Commander William Riker. Lieutenant CommanderGeordi La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,Chief? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is not a battle, Worf. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Permission granted. You have the bridge, Mister Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Red alert. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague andwith destroying us. I didn't see anything that suggested they wanted toassimilate anybody. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any idea what caused it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Proceed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye-aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I would still feel better if they could rendezvous with youroperatives in a less public place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would leave us without warp power for more than a week. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right in the middle of the gap? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I never fired a phaser on the science station. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right away. Data, Yar. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What happened to your predecessors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, it's just <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It must be very lonely. A princess in a very high tower. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wouldn't've made the mistake of leaving you. I know thatmuch. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was going to explain this to you after the ceremony, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I could get used to the idea of a Ferengi ensign, but AdmiralPicard on a Romulan warbird? What is that all about? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Three quarters impulse, full on my command. EnsignNagel, maximum shields. Mister Worf, prepare your little surprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nah. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing. It just fizzled out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, Ambassador. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, we've got company. I'm ready to pull you out ofthere. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another child? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The last report we have says they were observing the streamer atmedium range. Maybe they went in for a closer look, got more than theybargained for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're from a Federation starship. We answered your distresscall. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to ourSickbay. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Terrified? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna, this is nothing personal. Not everyone is cut out to bea Bridge Officer. I don't think this is for you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As you were. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're out of line, Mister. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you see that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, one of the things I've learned anything on thesevoyages, on this ship, and from you, is that most life forms act out ofan instinct for survival, not out of malice. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for asilver sphere. Destroy it with your phaser. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you. But it still seems incredible to me that you couldhave constructed this station so rapidly and so, so perfectly suited toour needs. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What did you find out? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What makes you say that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It appears, then disappears, then reappears. No predictablepattern, no sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At one point they were at Deep Space Nine, trying to sellbilitrium explosives. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In a Galaxy Class starship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Put a tractor beam on it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, did the sensors pick up anything unusual last night? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, your ship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I hope you'll be as thoughtful when the time comes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Lay in a course for the next search grid. Stand by to engage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You have your instructions. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then we should be able to send out a probe of our own, trace itback to the origin. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You were with Penthar-Mul when he died. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you found anything that might give us some insight intowhat happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the Zakdornian word for mismatch? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker of the Enterprise. Crewmembers. May I comet down and approach you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain, I have a report for you,sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the exact position listed in the Tripoli log. Do yourecognise anything, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Deanna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As First Officer, it is my responsibility to point out anyactions that may be mistakes by a commanding officer. sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Impeccable timing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get offthis ship. Are there any others survivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Obviously made by Colonel Richey. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What else have we got in the neighbourhood? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data, cut your engines. Take her in unpowered. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That would explain the accent. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It fits their historical pattern. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any records of similar phenomena in Starfleet listings? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hachidan kiritsu! It's illegal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi <eos> <bos> RIKER: The course to the Fleming is plotted and laid in, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is all that was left from their computer system. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Probably. This may take some time. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you don't do it, I will relieve you of duty. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander Data, we are approaching the Neutral Zone. Reportto the Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: All right. Be as casual as you can. Let us know when you'reready. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, bring the engines back online and restore allsystems to normal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Magnify. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They made you the lure to keep me here. They programmed youwhile I was relaxing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You'd better check it out. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You're damn right! And I intend to stay angry until I findwhoever's responsible for the Captain's death. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On Risa? That vacation must have been better than he let on. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Whatever's pulling us sure isn't in a hurry. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the first thing you remember, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's true. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, thanks. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: What then? How do we get the Enterprises that are already hereback to where they belong? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not sure I want to remember that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I can't accept that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Spacecraft? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And yet all sensors are operating properly. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Very convincing, but not perfect. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I am your worst nightmare. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you have anything else on them? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It is my duty to inform the Captain we believe he may be undersome kind of alien influence which may constitute a danger to thisship. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Energy consumption? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, I must say I've come to the same conclusion. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is that possible? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Acknowledged. Ensign, set your course for Solais Five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Give me a choice then. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then you're wrong. It's arrogant to think you'll never make amistake. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running hisdiagnostic. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, if you're right. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As we anticipated, the blast burned out ourmain navigational deflector. We also have damage to our shields and ourreactor core. <eos> <bos> RIKER: A pleasure, Mrs. Manheim. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, are you sensing any sort of interference from theCalamarain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I might be interested, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We were studying the ruins. It was a scientific expedition. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, no offence, but I have trouble believing that the man Ithat escorted to deck eight is supernatural. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Admiral? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This looks like the front door. Should we ring the bell? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Elaborate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nobody has suggested removing the Captain from command. Rightnow, all we have are suspicions. Not enough to act upon. The next moveis his. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister Suna. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Prepare to draw their fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Could anything he's proposing damage our system? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and just leave it atthat. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you're lucky, you'll only spend the next five years in prisoninstead of the next twenty. You've gottwelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in theKlingon Empire. Tell me what you know, and I'll pull some strings. Maybe they'll reduce your sentence after you've been extradited. <eos> <bos> RIKER: By treaty, that world still belongs to the Sheliak. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Someone sure stripped this place. <eos> <bos> RIKER: With what? We have no offensive weapons. <eos> <bos> RIKER: On screen. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what the hell happened? <eos> <bos> RIKER: There will be a meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteenhundred hours to draw up a mission plan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why this place? Why Vandor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And if we don't remove them, the Sheliak will. Forcefully. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is something you're going to have to decide for yourself,Ishara. Think about it while we're waiting for Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're bringing up the rest of the cargo now. We should be readyto leave within the hour. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why are you still here? <eos> <bos> RIKER: This one looks like you. Deanna, I have somethingon my mind. I had to see you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How was the reception? <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's good. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Don't stop, my friend. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf, extend shields around the ship. Lock on the tractor beam. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you telling me to leave, Captain? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Negative, Mister Worf. Mister Data, your final report. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Transporter room six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is this? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks. Energise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we get out of it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Ensign Gibson, take us to warp eight point eight. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And how long do you think the negotiations will take? <eos> <bos> RIKER: No, sir. But after your tailor is done, would you join me in thecargo bay? Mister La Forge has made some progress with the metalfragments. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's still headed for the Brechtian Cluster. We'vere-established our course. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tell him, Yuta. <eos> <bos> RIKER: They're early. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is off the record. I'm saying this as a friend, not yoursuperior officer. I think it would be best if you weren't so personallyinvolved with Aquiel right now. There's a lot about her we don't know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: So much for your reprieve from Starfleet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's not enough. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bridge to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My friend tells me you know about the man we're looking for. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Does it appear to have all your parts? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've got a problem. Our core fragment isgoing to pass by Moab Four in six days. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The last I knew, Commander Daren was on team six. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Computer, release command control this station. Authorisation,Riker Omega three. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll circuit in auxiliary power to the Bridge. Somehow we'llsilence Sousa if he decides to play an encore. <eos> <bos> RIKER: The transporter trace? <eos> <bos> RIKER: She said that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine. The Duras sisters,Lursa and B'Etor? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not at all. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Battle stations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Except for one thing. It hardly sounds like Q to give us anadvantage like that. Unless. <eos> <bos> RIKER: As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was atthe Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think anybody ever is. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Right behind that door. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is there any danger to the ship? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If they did hijack the Fleming, they sure didn't get very farwith the cargo. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's certainly good to know. Would you like something todrink? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Two weeks? That's not enough time to explore a region that size. I thought we had five weeks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that asevidence of hostile action. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thanks, O'Brien. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled thewarp drive at approximately the same time? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Backed by Romulans? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Did you have any luck downloading the station logs? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any other ships in that sector? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Another entity. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Do you remember the route you took to return? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Oh, yeah? Well he wasn't the only one. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What the hell do they want with you? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What am I seeing? <eos> <bos> RIKER: How do we do that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Hold on! We're going down. <eos> <bos> RIKER: My beard is not an affectation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain Picard sends his birthday wishes. He was needed on theBridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looks as if someone could have just dropped them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: That's suicide, Data. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeckthree. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me. I've got to study this mission briefing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Now an audience. Whoa. Too many. I was thinking of something alittle more intimate. <eos> <bos> RIKER: For all we know, you and I could hate each other. RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: There is one thing I'd like to do first. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Someone restrain the Captain! First Officer's log, supplemental. More than anhour has passed since the Captain beamed out, energy only. Every efforthas been made to determine his whereabouts. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's very healthy. Helps to keep you warm on cold Alaskannights. <eos> <bos> RIKER: In a sudden, abrupt power surge to high warpspeed, Captain, we may be able to break loose from that Ferengiforcefield. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Thank you, sir. I hope I showed some promise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nothing of the sort. As the governing body of Angel One, you'reentitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the Odinsurvivors? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Give us everything you can to close the gap,Geordi. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I had no idea it was such a ritual. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's our position, Geordi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Looking good. I'll go five. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any correlation with the readings from Earth? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can we have that done before we arrive? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes. Congratulations.<TheHathaway is old,battered, with that nacelledesign of two above, two below)PICARD <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Good. Troi? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If that reading is right, there is no seal. Give me lab interiorimage. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Enterprise to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain! <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's your status? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But you're so sure it'll talk to you. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We could launch a probe. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, fire up the impulse engines. Activate the <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what were you doing there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Slow to impulse speed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, do you read me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We're here, there's no danger. We'll look around then leave. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why, Data? It's just a derelict. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Any luck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: So unless someone runs to a window and looks out <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then I suppose that's your loss. We consider our families one ofour strengths. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, you'll brief him on what he needs to know? <eos> <bos> RIKER: The Captain approves. You're with us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Go ahead, Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I do, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: You think we got their attention, Data? <eos> <bos> RIKER: If I may, Captain. Then a trade, Groppler? Some things you needin return for lending us architects and engineerswho can demonstrate your techniques. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There are still risks. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Investigating some things that I've noticed since I've beenhere. The last was a piece of fruit. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I keep seeing this design. <eos> <bos> RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What are you saying? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to go to warp power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: At the time I thought it would be more advantageous for me to doa tour on the Enterprise. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't think we could have gotten it anycleaner. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's got us there, Captain. Q <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anticipating the worst, do you think they can be whipped intoshape in forty eight hours? <eos> <bos> RIKER: I wish we had some sign that he's in here. I guess we have nochoice but to risk it. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I was referring to the view. Eternity never looked so lovely. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Bottom line, La Forge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Main Bridge. <eos> <bos> RIKER: He's your father. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've an open wound, right here. It hurts like hell. I don't wantit to get better, and I don't want to pretend that everything's allright. <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's not that we don't believe you. It's just hard to see howboth stories could be true. Would you be willing have our Doctor checkyou out? 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Nitrogen oxide. Toxic levels. <eos> <bos> RIKER: How long before this hull ruptures? <eos> <bos> RIKER: But there was a very good chance we would have said yes. ZERO <eos> <bos> RIKER: So none of the background which we have provided would behelpful in understanding why they continue to fight? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Gladly. But first our starship. Can you release it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What's the safest way around? <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll return to the Enterprise and consider your proposal. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Geordi, what have you found? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What am I still doing here? Deanna, I pushedmyself hard to get this far. I sacrificed a lot. I always said I wantedmy own command, and yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong for meto want to stay? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look out! <eos> <bos> RIKER: Look. Try hailing them. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is it. There's the core, over there. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Are you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: And us right along with them. Captain's log, stardate 44359.5. What began as acurious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At currentspeed, the two-dimensional beings and the Enterprise will be drawn intothe cosmic string fragment in seven hours. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I knew he'd have a great time. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I'm not a murderer. I went to the Tanugan lab as anofficial representative of Starfleet. I actedaccordingly. I was there to evaluate Doctor Apgar's progress in thedevelopment of a Krieger Wave converter. That's all I was interestedin. Computer. Load deposition programme Riker one. Run the simulation. <eos> <bos> RIKER: This is the twenty fourth century, we're on Devidia Two, andyou're not supposed to be here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We'll need to dump the entire engine core. Do you have anauto-eject system? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Of course not, Mister Burke. That was Klingon guile. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I've felt better. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything we can do? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Doctor, this is going to have no impact on my report. It was amisunderstanding of the worst kind. We could straighten the entirething out if you would ask Mrs. Apgar to join us. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Anything from the surface? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why do you sound so surprised, MisterO'Brien? <eos> <bos> RIKER: It's a pleasure to meet you, Manua. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Captain, they're expecting us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we contactthem and let them know. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes,one of the hostages will be executed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: But your files they say you're a <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then what were you doing there? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Assuming you can, can you regulate the reaction? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Riker here. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What does that mean? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What kind of drop can we expect? <eos> <bos> RIKER: What if I snore in my sleep? RO <eos> <bos> RIKER: Like yesterday. The Janaran Falls on Betazed. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We don't know what's going on downthere. There's no need to take any chances. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Aye, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Not directly. Board of inquiry blamed Darson for carelessnessabout Ghorusdan cultural taboos. But if Elbrun was so good, why didn'the warn Darson? What was he doing there if he couldn't sense that muchhostility? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Can you treat it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Let's find out, or try to. Contact the Ferengi vessel,Lieutenant. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Is everyone all right? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reports coming in now. Nothing serious so far. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Initiate prefire sequence. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Worf would be my first choice, sir. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Arm phasers and prepare to lock on target. <eos> <bos> RIKER: What is it? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Excuse me? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, First Officerof the Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Have you stopped thinking about us? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Open a frequency to Colony Operations. <eos> <bos> RIKER: If you don't, you force me to take command of this vessel. 2 <eos> <bos> RIKER: Reduce power. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Agreed. Now talk. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Maybe we'd better talk in here. The Observation Lounge hasturned into a swamp. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Direct hit on their main reactor. They're returning fire. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Commander, we don't have to like each other to work welltogether. As a fact of fact, I'd like you to continue to keep me on mytoes. <eos> <bos> RIKER: No idea. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I thought you said the Enterprise was faster than this Romulan. <eos> <bos> RIKER: We've located another survivor of theKhitomer massacre, Captain a woman who was found with Worf. Her name isKahlest. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There's no vegetation, no insects, not even soil bacteria. Itleft nothing. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I'm on my way. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Where is he? <eos> <bos> RIKER: Everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to befine. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Yes, sir. Captain, if I may, I'll ask Counsellor Troi to lookthese visitors over. <eos> <bos> RIKER: There was another difference. I don't believe they were part ofthe Borg collective. I think they were acting as individuals. <eos> <bos> RIKER: I don't believe that. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Then prove it. You can begin by telling me something about thelocation and strength of the Romulan fleet. <eos> <bos> RIKER: Who is it? <eos>
