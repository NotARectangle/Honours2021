Data
----------
[Encounter at Farpoint Part I]: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it upto be human.
[The Naked Now]: I am already listed in several bio-mechanical texts, Doctor.
[The Naked Now]: Confirmed, sir. And there was a rather peculiar limerick beingdelivered by someone in the Shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure Iunderstand it. There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shapedlike
[The Naked Now]: I am sure he meant now. So, you need time to get into uniform.
[The Naked Now]: Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not familiar with
[The Naked Now]: I am sorry. I did not know,
[The Naked Now]: In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques,a broad variety of pleasuring,
[Code of Honor]: I may not understand human humour, sir, but I am a StarfleetAcademy graduate.
[The Last Outpost]: Apologies, Captain. I seem to have reached an odd functionalimpasse. I am stuck.
[The Last Outpost]: Yes, sir. That is what I am trying to do, sir, but the solutioneludes me.
[Lonely Among Us]: I am referring to the great detective's credo, sir. I quote, wemust fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail,whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
[Justice]: You were right, sir. I do tend to babble. Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever theobject or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a nemesis. It isone thing to communicate with something mysterious, but it is quiteanother to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether itunderstands the same concept of reason that we do?
[The Big Goodbye]: Request complete text of all stories involving said character. Increase speed. Captain's log, supplemental. The Jaradan rendezvousstill is eleven hours away. I am about to reenter the worldof Dixon Hill, this time properly dressed. An experience like this ismore enjoyable when shared, so I've invited our fiction expert, Whalen,to accompany me. Doctor Crusher will join us shortly.
[The Big Goodbye]: Request permission to accompany you, sir. I am totally versed inthe genre of the period.
[The Big Goodbye]: I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls forthe environment are, therefore, not accessible.
[The Big Goodbye]: I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant.
[Datalore]: It does not, unfortunately. It means only the knowledge they hadaccumulated. Actually, I am quite deficient in some basic humaninformation. Sneezing, for example.
[Datalore]: And do you realise, Lore, that I am obligated to report all ofthis to our ship's Captain?
[Angel One]: I am unfamiliar with that term.
[Angel One]: I am an android, Mistress, although anatomically I am a male.
[11001001]: I am awaiting inspiration.
[11001001]: The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I aminitiating Red Alert.
[11001001]: Do you think I am responsible?
[11001001]: I am here, sir.
[Too Short a Season]: I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information inmy tricorder, sir.
[When the Bough Breaks]: Eventually, sir. I am working on it now but the number ofpermutations is almost endless.
[When the Bough Breaks]: I am not aware of Regulation six point five seven.
[Home Soil]: I am running the base drilling programme.
[Heart of Glory]: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from theleakage in the drive system.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: Sir, other than ourselves, I am picking up no life signs here.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: I am getting energy readings. Look out!
[We'll Always Have Paris]: I am fully versed, sir, on all your theories regarding time andgravity.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: I am an android.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: I am the only one, sir.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: I am proceeding to the lab, sir.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of hissecurity precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory.
[Conspiracy]: Commander Riker. I am receiving a Code Forty Seven.
[Conspiracy]: Captain. I am now receiving a message from Starfleet Command.
[The Outrageous Okona]: Sexual attraction in this context is not a part of myprogramming. I am an android.
[The Outrageous Okona]: So you agree with Okona that I am missing avery important human factor.
[The Outrageous Okona]: I am capable of that function when it is expected of me.
[The Outrageous Okona]: I am not laughing.
[The Outrageous Okona]: I am an android.
[Loud as a Whisper]: It was my fault. I am responsible for their deaths. In myarrogance I thought no one could possibly harm the great Riva. I amsuch a fool.
[Loud as a Whisper]: Light the torches to let them know that I am back.
[Loud as a Whisper]: You may leave whenever you choose. I will send out a message whenI am ready to go.
[The Schizoid Man]: I have noticed, Grandpa, that you keep repeating the same notesof a musical phrase I am unfamiliar with.
[The Schizoid Man]: I am glad, sir. It was his dying wish.
[The Schizoid Man]: I am sorry, sir. Perhaps it was my admirationfor Grandpa that got the best of me.
[The Schizoid Man]: I am many things. Scholar, Artist, philosopher, lover, genius.
[The Schizoid Man]: If you wish to apologise, I am prepared to listen.
[The Schizoid Man]: That is ridiculous. I am as healthy as a Rigelian ox.
[The Schizoid Man]: I am sure that will not be necessary, Captain. I am fully capableof running a circuit check on myself. It will immediately determine anyabnormalities.
[The Schizoid Man]: Just as I expected. I am fine. Could not be better.
[The Schizoid Man]: Hello, Kareen. Don't you think it's time westopped pretending? You know who I am.
[The Schizoid Man]: You do know who I am.
[The Schizoid Man]: It is me. I am here. I am alive.
[The Schizoid Man]: I had every right, Captain. I am man, he is machine. There is noquestion who must live and what must die.
[The Schizoid Man]: You are most fortunate, my dear Captain, that I am not a violentman.
[Unnatural Selection]: I am sorry I could not be more helpful, Doctor Pulaski.
[The Measure of a Man]: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes are far superior to humanbiological eyes. True? Then why are not all human officers required tohave their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants? I see. It is precisely because I am not human.
[The Measure of a Man]: No, sir, I am not under your nor anyone else's command. I haveresigned from Starfleet.
[The Measure of a Man]: I regret the decision, but I must. I am the culmination of oneman's dream. This is not ego or vanity, but when Doctor Soong createdme he added to the substance of the universe. If by your experiments Iam destroyed, something unique, something wonderful will be lost. Icannot permit that, I must protect his dream.
[The Measure of a Man]: I see. From limitless options I am reduced to none, or ratherone. I can only hope that Commander Maddox is more capable than itwould appear.
[The Measure of a Man]: I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights andstatus. Am I a person or property?
[The Measure of a Man]: Not yet, sir. But with your help, I am learning. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

[Contagion]: No, I am damaged.
[Contagion]: I am accessing.
[Contagion]: I am on the Enterprise. How did I get here?
[Contagion]: Iconia? I was on Iconia, now I am on the Enterprise.
[The Royale]: Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved,I am mainly conducting research into
[The Royale]: Commander, I am picking up something mostunusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be humanDNA.
[The Royale]: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am.
[Time Squared]: Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained from theshuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order toactivate the shuttle's systems.
[Pen Pals]: Those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish frombackground noise. That is why I am boosting the power.
[Pen Pals]: Yes, sir. I am glad that you understand, sir.
[Pen Pals]: I am sorry for that, but it is very complicated. Does your familyknow where you are?
[Pen Pals]: I am certain that you could.
[Pen Pals]: I am afraid that is not possible.
[Pen Pals]: Because I am a machine.
[Samaritan Snare]: I am programming the comm. system to scan the interferencepatterns, but a full analysis will take time.
[Manhunt]: She is correct, sir. I am detecting large amounts of ultritium.
[The Emissary]: Sensors show life forms aboard, but I am unable to ascertainwhether they are awake or dormant. However, the vessel's propulsionsystems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep.
[Peak Performance]: Obviously, I am not.
[Peak Performance]: That is what troubles me. I made no mistakes. I have conducted adiagnostic check of all of my programs. I am cross-checking with theship's computer.
[Peak Performance]: I am conducting diagnostic
[Peak Performance]: No, Doctor, this is not ego. I am concerned about giving theCaptain unsound advice.
[Peak Performance]: Why, Doctor? It is done, and perhaps just as well. This hasindicated that I am damaged in some fashion. I must find themalfunction.
[Shades of Gray]: I am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres. However, Iam reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilised.
[Shades of Gray]: I am always careful.
[Shades of Gray]: I am superior, sir, in many ways. But I would gladly give it upto be human.
[The Ensigns of Command]: I am ready, sir.
[Evolution]: Captain. Doctor. I am honoured by your presence, but may Isuggest you attend the second concert.
[Evolution]: Although I am technically proficient, according to my fellowperformers, I lack soul.
[Evolution]: That is correct. I am an android. I am Lieutenant Commander Dataof the Federation Starship Enterprise.
[Evolution]: I am not ordering him to do anything. I am merely trying topersuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. Do you believemy suggested course of action should be followed?
[Evolution]: In spite of the fact that I am an android?
[Evolution]: And you conclude because of this that I am impartial. Hence, youaccept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not.
[Evolution]: In human parlance, I do not believe I can getthe job done. My training has prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact I am proving to be
[Evolution]: I am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correctmany malfunctions.
[Evolution]: Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am comingto the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct.
[Evolution]: I can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris, but Itrust my point is clear. I am one android with a single weapon. Thereare hundreds of Sheliak on the way and their weapons are far morepowerful. They may not offer you a target. They can obliterate you fromorbit. You will die never having seen the faces of your killers. Thechoice is yours.
[Evolution]: Lieutenant Commander Data to Enterprise. I ampreparing to leave Tau Cygna Five and await rendezvous instructions.
[Evolution]: I could not have succeeded without your support and insight. I amgrateful for your assistance.
[Evolution]: I am incapable of forgetting. I will remember every detail of myvisit here with perfect clarity.
[The Vengeance Factor]: Commander, I am detecting life signs from behind that door.
[The Vengeance Factor]: Captain, I am detecting life readings from the planet surface, aswell as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxideemissions, indicative of combustion.
[The Defector]: No, nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, Ithink the king is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as itdoth to me, in his nakedness he appears but a man. Therefore, hisfears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet no manshould possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,should dishearten his army.
[The Defector]: I am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is theirfavourite on the ship.
[The Defector]: I am afraid they would require the molecular structure of thebeverage in question. And, as you are no doubt aware, our knowledge ofyour planet is quite limited.
[The Defector]: I am picking them up, sir, but I cannot identify the source. Theyseem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometreapogee.
[The Hunted]: I am afraid the prisoner has eluded us, sir.
[The Hunted]: I am an android. I believe you and I have something in common.
[The Hunted]: I do not mean to belittle your condition. I understand yourdilemma. But I am curious. Myprogramme can be altered. Yours cannot?
[The Hunted]: Except that I am not programmed to kill.
[The Hunted]: I am incapable of any feeling.
[The Hunted]: Danar is extremely adept, sir. I am not certain which securitymeasure he is attempting to circumvent. Sir, Danar has succeeded inrestoring power to shuttlebay two.
[The Hunted]: Lieutenant, I am reading an open panel. K twelve, J nine,deck thirty.
[The Hunted]: I am afraid his true destination remains a mystery. Readings nowindicate an open access panel in Jeffries tube N eleven, deck thirtyeight.
[The High Ground]: Dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure, sir, that Icannot say. Sir, I am finding it difficult to understand many aspectsof Ansata conduct. Much of their behavioral norm would be defined by myprogramme as unnecessary and unacceptable.
[Déjà Q]: I am an android, not a robot. Q
[Déjà Q]: I am merely stating a fact, Counsellor.
[The Offspring]: I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do youwish me to deactivate Lal?
[The Offspring]: That is why I must attempt this, sir. I have observed that inmost species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves. Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were to be damaged ordestroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successfulwith the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand therisk, sir. and I am prepared to accept the responsibility.
[The Offspring]: I can give her attention, Doctor. But I am incapable of givingher love.
[The Offspring]: I am certain the Admiral is anxious to meetLal. I have been sending him regular status reports on her development.
[The Offspring]: I am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent whenhis first child was born.
[The Offspring]: I am programmed with the procedures you mention, sir. And in anymeaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis ofcomparison. I am the only model available, Admiral.
[The Offspring]: Admiral, when I created Lal, it was in the hope that someday shewould choose to enter the Academy and become a member of Starfleet. Iwanted to give something back in return for all Starfleet has given me. I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give herup. I cannot. It would violate every lesson I have learned about humanparenting. I have brought a new life into this world, and it is myduty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these first difficult stepsto maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be acontributing member of society. No one can relieve me from thatobligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am her father.
[The Offspring]: Yes, Lal. I am here.
[The Offspring]: Lal? I am unable to correct the systemfailure.
[Tin Man]: I am Data. An android.
[Tin Man]: I do not believe I am qualified to express an opinion.
[Tin Man]: I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. Are you not going toallow Tam to fulfill his mission?
[Hollow Pursuits]: The matter-antimatter injectors locked for a split second. I amnot certain why, sir. They appear to be working properly now.
[The Most Toys]: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterpriseshuttlebay two, prepare for docking, level oneprecautions for incoming material remain in effect.
[The Most Toys]: Then I am forced to attempt escape.
[The Most Toys]: I am not, sir. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntaryconfinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you haveviolated Federation law
[The Most Toys]: I am a Starfleet officer.
[The Most Toys]: No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force inthe cause of defense.
[The Most Toys]: Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttlebay two, prepare for docking. Level one precautionsremain in effect.
[The Most Toys]: I am trained in evasive manoeuvres.
[The Most Toys]: No, sir, it does not. I do not feel pleasure. I am only anandroid. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

[Transfigurations]: I am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit aroundthe planet. It reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: I am afraid I cannot answer that Wesley. And as you are anewcomer to the game, may I say it is inappropriate for you to ask. Iwill buy another card, Counsellor.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: The neural link will be established in three stages. Doctor, Isuggest you closely observe Captain Picard's lifesigns, while at eachstage Chief O'Brien monitors my positronic matrix activity. Counsellor,hopefully, you will be able to determine whether I am reaching CaptainPicard.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: I am unable to penetrate defence systemscommand structure
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: I am attempting to penetrate the Borgregenerative subcommand path. It is a low priority system and may beaccessible.
[Brothers]: I am not less perfect than Lore.
[Brothers]: I am not less perfect than Lore.
[Remember Me]: I am afraid ship's records do not concur. Doctor.
[Legacy]: I am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escapepod.
[Legacy]: Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I amCommander Data.
[Legacy]: I am an android.
[Legacy]: I am an android. It is not possible for me to be injured in thatfashion.
[Legacy]: Perhaps I am fortunate, sir, to be spared the emotionalconsequences.
[Future Imperfect]: Pardon me, sir. I am experiencing subspace interference whichlimits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as
[The Loss]: I am adding virtual particle trajectories.
[The Loss]: Unknown. I am attempting to analyse motion pattern. Results stillinconclusive.
[The Loss]: I am differentiating particle-emissionsignatures now.
[Data's Day]: Sine I am not affected by emotionalconsiderations, I am closer to being Vulcan than human. However, whiletheir devotion to logic does have a certain appeal, I find their starkphilosophy to be somewhat limited.
[Data's Day]: Friendly insults and jibes, another form of human speechthat I am attempting to master, in this case with the help of CommanderGeordi La Forge.
[Data's Day]: I am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults. It was notmeant as a serious disparagement.
[Data's Day]: No. Geordi, I am still confused by Chief O'Brien's reaction thismorning.
[Data's Day]: I am rarely in need of Doctor BeverlyCrusher's professional services as my bio-mechanical maintenanceprogramme is self sufficient. But I often observe as she practicesmedicine on others and have learned a great deal about humaninteraction from her.
[Data's Day]: It is fortunate that I am able to perform my duties withoutemotional distractions. If that were not the case, a sudden coursecorrection toward the Neutral Zone would make me very nervous.
[Data's Day]: I am your friend.
[Data's Day]: In an effort to be helpful, I am attempting to calculate thevariables involved in a successful marriage.
[Data's Day]: But I am their friend. Should I not stand with them in a time ofdifficulty?
[Data's Day]: Although I am an android, I have not excluded the possibilitythat I, too, may someday marry.
[Data's Day]: Thank you, Doctor. I am now prepared to dance at the wedding.
[Data's Day]: Captain, I am detecting a ship in the Neutral Zone. Configuration, Romulan warbird.
[Data's Day]: Keiko, I need your help. I have offended youand need to find a way to rectify my mistake. I am not sure what to do.
[Data's Day]: I am not nervous. I am confused.
[Data's Day]: There are still many human emotions I do not fullycomprehend. Anger, hatred, revenge. But I am not mystified by thedesire to be loved or the need for friendship. These are things I dounderstand.
[Data's Day]: If being human is not simply a matter of being born fleshand blood, if it is instead a way of thinking, acting and feeling, thenI am hopeful that one day I will discover my own humanity.
[Data's Day]: Until then Commander Maddox, I will continue learning,changing, growing, and trying to become more than what I am. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

[Devil's Due]: Your courtesy is appreciated, sir. But I am aware that I do noteffectively convey the fear called for in this scene.
[Devil's Due]: Sir, I have modified the Method for my own uses. Since I have noemotional awareness to create a performance, I am attempting to useperformance to create emotional awareness. I believe if I can learn toduplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, I will be one step closer totruly understanding humanity.
[Devil's Due]: I am an android.
[Devil's Due]: Ardra is right. If I am chosen, I will perform my duties withoutbias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee I will deliver a verdict in yourfavour.
[Clues]: I am unable to answer that question, sir.
[Clues]: I am perfectly comfortable.
[Clues]: I am not saying that at all. I merely state a possiblealternative explanation.
[Clues]: I am apparently guilty of falsifying the Enterprise's records, ofinterfering with an investigation, of disobeying adirect order from my commanding officer. Your duty seems clear, sir.
[Clues]: As a Starfleet officer, I am required to follow all of yourorders, Captain.
[Galaxy's Child]: Commander, I am picking up some unusualreadings from the Alpha Omicron system. At this range, all I am able todiscernis that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy.
[Galaxy's Child]: A change in energy readings, sir. I am reading an internalbuildup of gamma particles in
[Galaxy's Child]: The asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite, which isinterfering with our scanners. I am also detecting traces of kephneum,a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being. It is likelythe asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform, sir.
[Galaxy's Child]: I am detecting other radio transmissions,Captain.
[Night Terrors]: I am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate.
[Identity Crisis]: I am aware of that, Doctor. However, I can see no otherreasonable course of investigation available to us. And we may not havemuch time.
[Identity Crisis]: I am an android. It is not possible
[Identity Crisis]: Starfleet personnel have vanished. Others may be at risk. We mustdo the best we can to find out why. However, I am strongly motivated tosolve this mystery.
[Identity Crisis]: I am showing no transporter activity.
[The Mind's Eye]: I am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself.
[The Mind's Eye]: We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip. CommanderRiker has speculated that it may be a Romulan transmission. I amattempting to track its source.
[The Mind's Eye]: Computer, I am reading anomalous variationsin the molecular structure of these memory chips. Please confirm.
[The Mind's Eye]: Yes, sir, I am.
[In Theory]: The contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. Wewill give more attention to the rhythmic patterns at our nextrehearsal. However, I am quite certain the audience was oblivious tosuch nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly.
[In Theory]: I am nearly finished compiling readings from our most recentilluminatory burst. Dark matter density is nearly one order ofmagnitude higher than in similar nebulae. Life forms here may havedeveloped in ways never before observed.
[In Theory]: But I am not capable of love.
[In Theory]: Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me, but I amnot capable of returning those feelings.
[In Theory]: Captain, I am seeking advice in how
[In Theory]: I have none. The rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion,but I am picking up no evidence of a subspace field.
[In Theory]: Darling, you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the first day wemet. I believe I am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of thegalaxy. Now, you relax. Put your feet up and I will take care ofeverything.
[In Theory]: But I am happy to do it.
[In Theory]: Perhaps I am not giving you enough compliments? Your hair islooking particularly silky tonight.
[In Theory]: You are not my mother. That is the appropriate response for yourstatement that I am behaving foolishly.
[In Theory]: With regard to romantic relationships, there is no real me. I amdrawing upon various cultural and literary sources to help define myrole.
[In Theory]: That is a valid projection. It is apparent that my reach hasexceeded my grasp in this particular area. I am perhapsnot nearly so human as I aspire to become. If you are ready to eat, Iwill bring our meal.
[Redemption, Part II]: I am confused. Why have I not been assigned to command a ship inthe fleet, sir?
[Redemption, Part II]: I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
[Redemption, Part II]: I am aware of the difficulties. Please bring the phasers backonline.
[Darmok]: I am at a loss, sir.
[Darmok]: Commander. I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasmareactor.
[Ensign Ro]: I am picking up molecular displacementtraces. That suggests movement through this area during the last tenhours.
[Ensign Ro]: I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space. Twoships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero fiveone.
[Silicon Avatar]: I am not entirely certain they will, sir.
[Silicon Avatar]: No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta,you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken,Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's.
[Silicon Avatar]: I do understand, and I am attempting to explain to you it isimpossible.
[Silicon Avatar]: I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However, fromwhat I know of him by his memories and his writing, I do not believe hewould be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now youhave destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believehe would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sadnow. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

[Disaster]: I have a connection, sir. I am now stabilising the containmentfield.
[The Game]: It does not bother me. In fact, I am happy to
[Unification, Part I]: Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir. I am content to stand.
[Unification, Part I]: I was processing all of the information we have accumulated onRomulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.
[Unification, Part I]: I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organise myfiles.
[Unification, Part I]: I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir. I will not look in yourdirection.
[Unification, Part I]: I would not have thought it possible, sir. I am eager to test thesuccess of our efforts. It doesremain to be seen if the Romulans will accept us. Captain, you haveseemed unusually pensive since we received the news of AmbassadorSarek's death.
[Unification, Part I]: This is definitely the street on which theintelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir. Adjusting for theoptical distortions, I am able to verify the architectural features.
[Unification, Part I]: I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful.
[Unification, Part II]: I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan CentralInformation net.
[Unification, Part II]: Communication lines have been terminated atthe transmitter, but I am quite certain the message was sent prior tothe interruption.
[Unification, Part II]: I disagree, Commander. After studying the design of thisstructure, I have determined that our best route of escape would be theunderground exit to the east of this wing. I have disconnected certainsecurity scanners to assist us. I am afraid we cannot permit you towarn your guards.
[A Matter of Time]: If you're referring to the first productionmodel automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent ModelA might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong'srevised prototype.
[A Matter of Time]: Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whetheror not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century?
[A Matter of Time]: Actually, I am capable of distinguishing over one hundred andfifty simultaneous compositions, but in order to analyse theaesthetics, I try to keep it to ten or less.
[A Matter of Time]: I am assisting Commander La Forge with a very complexcalculation. It demands a great deal of my concentration.
[Hero Worship]: I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations, sir.
[Hero Worship]: I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It isgoing to be okay. I will count to three. One two three.  DATA
[Hero Worship]: No, I am not capable of hatred.
[Hero Worship]: I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally andphysically.
[Hero Worship]: No. I am the only one.
[Hero Worship]: At times, I too find it difficult to share my thoughts withothers. I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in amanner which humans can comprehend. But do I know that
[Hero Worship]: I am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest. However, Ican analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparativeconclusions about its possible effect on the human palate. But Ineither like it nor dislike it.
[Hero Worship]: I am an android. That will never change.
[Hero Worship]: I am operating within established parameters. How are you?
[Conundrum]: The databanks that identify who I am are not functioning.
[Conundrum]: Several possibilities suggest themselves. I may represent anentire race of artificial lifeforms. If so, there may be a home planetfor others of my kind. A shared history and a culture of which I am notpresently aware.
[Conundrum]: There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin is unique. Inthat case, I am alone. We have accessed the information storage area. Considerable damage has been done to the files themselves.
[Conundrum]: I am picking up no vessels, no additional sentry pods.
[The Outcast]: Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading. It appears to be aneutrino emission with no visible source.
[Cause and Effect]: The tractor beam will not be successful. I am decompressing themain shuttlebay.
[Imaginary Friend]: It may be difficult, sir. I am detecting a significant number ofstrands behind us.
[I, Borg]: Captain, I am detecting a transmission emanating from within thesystem.
[I, Borg]: Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference. Readings are still inconclusive, however the moon's atmosphere iscapable of supporting life.
[The Next Phase]: In all likelihood, the explosion damaged the Romulan cloakingdevice, causing it to discharge chroniton particles. I am detecting a chroniton field in here.
[The Next Phase]: Lieutenant, I am planning a memorial servicefor Commander La Forge and Ensign Ro. I would like you to participate.
[The Next Phase]: I find I am having difficulty deciding what kind of service tohave. Do you have any suggestions?
[The Next Phase]: I am not certain that either human or Bajoran rites are fitting,and I have researched the funerary customs of over five thousandcultures to no avail.
[The Next Phase]: Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to saya ritual farewell to those you call friends. I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me asthough I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. Heaccepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. ButI do not know how to say goodbye. RO
[The Next Phase]: That explains the chroniton fields I am detecting in here now. For your own safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions.
[The Next Phase]: I am glad you approve, Doctor.
[The Next Phase]: If I am right, sir, they are, and in this room. Their briefappearance coincided with the anyon sweep. Perhaps the anyonsneutralise the cloaking effect. Chief Brossmer.
[The Inner Light]: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable toblock it.
[The Inner Light]: I am attempting to do so, Doctor.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am simply trying to make an objective assessment.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seenothers around me age. Until now it has been theoretically possible thatI would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might findthis attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I amartificial.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I amnot that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: One might also conclude that it brings me one step closer tobeing human. I am mortal.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behavetoward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when Iappear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that anaccurate observation?
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well,Counsellor.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: They're either unaware of me or choosingto ignore me. I am moving approximately ten metres north of my startingposition to observe more closely.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am reading a temporal distortion ofmassive proportions. The ophidian is cap time-space continuum.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: Caught in the after effect. I amattempting
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: Excuse me. Pardon me. I am searching for two individuals with anophidian. A snake.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am sorry, but I have no whiskey to give you.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am sorry, but I have no form of legal tender.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I would be happy to do so, but I am presently in need ofinformation.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am a Frenchman.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: But I am capable of performing significant tasks both mental andphysical. Perhaps your hotel would offer me a job.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am a Frenchman.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am an inventor.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am a personal friend.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am sorry for the disruption, but he would not believe me when Itold him we were friends.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I am from the twenty fourth century, where you and I serve aboarda starship.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I am French, sir, not Swiss.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I am unfamiliar with the gentleman's name. I have spoken toseveral people at that office.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary messageentered into my static memory by Captain Picard. Geordi, are weplanning to fire on the alien habitat?
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so that the force ofthe explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: Commander, I am picking up massive triolicwave activity on the surface.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: Sir, I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface andhuman life signs.
[Relics]: I am having difficulty scanning the object. It appears to beapproximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter.
[Relics]: No, sir. I am an android. Lieutenant Commander Data.
[Relics]: The resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible withour power systems. Warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded. I am attempting to compensate.
[Relics]: Approximately ninety million kilometres from the star'sphotosphere. I am reading a great deal of surface instability. It maybe
[Schisms]: I am reading a massive explosion.
[Schisms]: I am attempting to localise it. It is Cargo bay four.
[Schisms]: Whenever I am on the ship, the warp field leaves anelectromagnetic signal on my internal servo-fluid system. Between theperiod of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours thatsignature is missing.
[True Q]: Captain, I am reading a massive energy fluctuation in theplanet's atmosphere.
[Rascals]: I am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays. We arebeing boarded, sir.
[A Fistful of Datas]: I am now attempting to access the long rangesensor array.
[A Fistful of Datas]: There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I amdisconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated.
[A Fistful of Datas]: I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronicsubprocessor. But I am fine.
[The Quality of Life]: I am reading significant power fluctuations from the stationcore. Please report.
[The Quality of Life]: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lieutenant CommanderData.
[The Quality of Life]: I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid soquickly.
[The Quality of Life]: I am confident they will. Commander La Forge is especially
[The Quality of Life]: I am searching for a definition that will allow me to test anhypothesis.
[The Quality of Life]: And what about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. I amconsidered to be alive.
[The Quality of Life]: I am curious as to what transpired between the moment when I wasnothing more than an assemblage of parts in Doctor Soong's laboratory,and the next moment, when I became alive. What was it that endowed mewith life?
[The Quality of Life]: You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in theuniverse. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realised I mightbe encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility existsthat I was no longer alone. For that reason, I. The exocomp hasreturned.
[The Quality of Life]: Commander, if I am correct, the exocomps will not allowthemselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival, and theywill shut down before they will comply with the order.
[The Quality of Life]: It is true I am acting on my personal beliefs, but I do not seehow I can do otherwise.
[The Quality of Life]: I have observed that humans often base their judgments on what isreferred to as instinct or intuition. Because I am a machine, I lackthat particular ability. However it may be possible that I have insightinto other machines that humans lack.
[Face of the Enemy]: I am unable to make a precise measurement. However I wouldestimate impact within ninety seconds.
[Birthright, Part I]: Commander, I am reading a minor power drainin the starboard conduit.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am sorry, but use of sickbay equipment is limited to ship'smedical personnel.
[Birthright, Part I]: Yes. I do have a functional respiration system. However, itspurpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems. I am, infact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am not capable of either of those functions.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am sorry to bother you, but I have a question of a personalnature. Do you have a moment?
[Birthright, Part I]: But I am not looking for my father.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am sorry to disturb you, sir.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am painting.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am not certain. I began by painting the image of theblacksmith. Then I painted the corridor. After that, the anvil, thehammer, and Doctor Soong's face. The thought then occurred to me that Ishould paint smoke.
[Birthright, Part I]: Perhaps. After I painted the smoke, it then occurred to me topaint a bird's wing. I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birdsflying in formation. An individual feather. If the image of a bird isrelated to my vision, I do not understand how. I am left with more of amystery than ever. Geordi, I would like to recreate the experimentwhich caused my initial shut down.
[Birthright, Part I]: I am aware of the risks involved. But I can think of no other wayto investigate my experience. Will you help?
[Starship Mine]: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment withnon-relevant conversation.
[The Chase]: I am familiar with many Klingon rituals, including the B'aht Qul.
[The Chase]: I am scanning all seven planets of the Vilmoran system. Noneappears to support life.
[The Chase]: I am reading a small pocket of vegetativelife. A primitive lichen growing in a fossilised seabed.
[Suspicions]: I am unable to locate any malfunction. All systems are operatingaccording to your design specifications.
[Suspicions]: I am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was nopermanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull.
[Rightful Heir]: Faith? Then you do believe Kahless may have supernaturalattributes? As an android, I am unable to acceptthat which cannot be proven through rational means. I would appreciatehearing your insights on this matter.
[Rightful Heir]: I am curious. Do you still think the real Kahless will returnsomeday? Or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisiswhich originally sent you to Boreth?
[Second Chances]: Lieutenant, I am curious about something. If you met a double ofyourself, would you have difficulty interacting with him?
[Timescape]: Captain, I am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting thetable. It appears that within the disturbance, time is moving at anaccelerated rate, approximately fifty times faster than normal. Thedisturbance is spherical in shape. It is extending outward from thehull approximately seventeen metres from the ship.
[Timescape]: Sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field. I am unable to scanwithin the vessels.
[Timescape]: I am not certain. They exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns. Very possibly organic.
[Timescape]: Yes, but I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. I am notsure he is a Romulan.
[Timescape]: I have been testing the aphorism, 'a watched pot never boils'. Ihave boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times. Insome cases, I have ignored the kettle. In others, I have watched itintently. In every instance, the waterreaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one point seven seconds. It would appear that I am not capable of perceiving time anydifferently than my internal chronometer.
[Descent, Part I]: There is a great deal of electromagnetic interference. I amunable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present.
[Descent, Part I]: You are correct in that I have no frame of reference to confirmmy hypothesis. In fact, I am unable to provide a verbal description ofthe experience. Perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry. Icould then use that as a reference.
[Descent, Part I]: But what if it does, Counsellor? What if it turns out that thoseare the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not makeme a bad person?
[Descent, Part I]: I believe I am able to resume my duties.
[Descent, Part I]: I am attempting to recreate the experience which caused to myinitial burst of anger.
[Descent, Part I]: During the original incident the Borg presented a genuine dangerto my life. Since the Holodeck safety routine is in place, I know mylife is not in danger. Since I am trying to duplicate the conditions ofthe original incident as closely as possible, I must also attempt toduplicate the jeopardy as well.
[Descent, Part I]: Main power is offline. I am switching to backups.
[Descent, Part II]: Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to mybrother.
[Descent, Part II]: I am not your puppet anymore.
[Descent, Part II]: I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They aredesigned to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns. Once they arein place, I will destroy the existing brain cells. We'll see if theartificial neural network is able to take over your cognitivefunctions.
[Descent, Part II]: I am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells.
[Descent, Part II]: I am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net. I willneed to do further testing before I proceed. Someone will come and takeyou back to your cell.
[Descent, Part II]: I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible.
[Descent, Part II]: I am relieved that the injuries I inflicted on you are notpermanent.
[Descent, Part II]: No. I am pleased to say it was damaged when I was forced to fireon Lore.
[Interface]: No. I have completed the adjustments on the interface. I am nowwaiting for Commander Riker to finish moving the probe. Do you need tobe comforted?
[Interface]: I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry.
[Interface]: I am not offended. You are upset. Your reactions are notsurprising.
[Interface]: I am increasing the input now.
[Interface]: I am familiar enough with your behaviour patterns to predictcertain decisions.
[Interface]: I am establishing the interface.
[Interface]: I am reading unusual subspace energy in your vicinity, similar towhat the probe sensor recorded the first time you encountered yourmother.
[Gambit, Part I]: I am aware of that.
[Gambit, Part II]: I am aware of that.
[Gambit, Part II]: I am aware of the tactical situation, Lieutenant. Let them go.
[Gambit, Part II]: Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary ship is heading toward thesecoordinates in the Hyralan Sector.
[Gambit, Part II]: Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with yourperformance as First Officer.
[Gambit, Part II]: Dismissed. Mister Worf, I am sorry if I have ended ourfriendship.
[Gambit, Part II]: I am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct asearch would be consistent with the spirit of the Treaty.
[Gambit, Part II]: I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation.
[Phantasms]: Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinateamount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say Iam preoccupied.
[Phantasms]: Captain, I am taking the warp-coil engines offline.
[Phantasms]: I am sorry, Counsellor.
[Phantasms]: Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I wascausing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up. Doctor Freud, I am curious.
[Phantasms]: I am curious. What do my nightmares mean?
[Phantasms]: I do not believe I am being helped by this session.
[Phantasms]: I am reminded of a recent dream. This brace is reminiscent of
[Phantasms]: I am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays,sir. We will have the results of the analysis in approximately tenminutes.
[Phantasms]: I am afraid if I have another waking dream, I might injure him.
[Phantasms]: It is an interesting hypothesis. If I ambeing affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level,it may also explain my waking dreams, and my subsequent anti-socialbehaviour.
[Force of Nature]: I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in Spot. Althoughshe does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer consolewhen I am working.
[Force of Nature]: Yes. I am studying several new techniques.
[Force of Nature]: I am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimatelyfail.
[Force of Nature]: It is part of her training programme. I am teaching Spot to jumpdown from the desk on my command.
[Force of Nature]: Captain, I am picking up a small metallic object, approximatelythree point five metres in diameter.
[Force of Nature]: I am not certain that is true. I believe I have an idea.
[Inheritance]: I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story istrue.
[Inheritance]: I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify herassertions.
[Inheritance]: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavaladuring the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. Theywere both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Thetato Mavala and returned four days later.
[Inheritance]: Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with thefact that my father never mentioned her to me.
[Inheritance]: I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of apast about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curiousto learn more about it.
[Inheritance]: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue.
[Inheritance]: Yes. I am attempting to master all known styles of painting. Thisone is in the style of the early French impressionists.
[Inheritance]: I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation?
[Inheritance]: I am detecting no signs of
[Inheritance]: I am incapable of anger.
[Inheritance]: I am not certain I do. Perhaps you could clarify them for me?
[Inheritance]: I am Data.
[Inheritance]: I am fine.
[Inheritance]: I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did, buthis wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with whatwould be best for her.
[Inheritance]: I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best forher from what would be best for me.
[Inheritance]: There is something I thought you should know. My father told methat he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted nevertelling her how much he cared for her. I am certain he was referring toyou.
[Parallels]: Sector one nine six five eight, sir. I am unable to access it'smain computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location.
[Parallels]: I am initiating a subspace scan to search fortemporal anomalies on or off the ship.
[Parallels]: I am not privy to the exact details of when, where or how yourfirst coupling took place. I could investigate it
[Parallels]: I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system. Perhaps weshould try to pinpoint the exact moment when events becamediscontinuous. Do you remember the first change?
[Parallels]: I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA.
[Parallels]: Not from this distance, sir. I am also detecting an ion trailintersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet typesix shuttlecraft.
[The Pegasus]: Scan of grid one five seven is complete. I ammoving to grid one five eight.
[The Pegasus]: It is theoretically possible, sir, but I am unaware of any priorsituations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetarybody. There may be unforeseen difficulties.
[Sub Rosa]: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if theyhave been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across theentire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activityabove the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a stormsystem.
[Sub Rosa]: I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop hasformed in the transfer beam. I will have to go to the substation andattempt to correct the problem from there.
[Sub Rosa]: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. Itappears to extend to the cellular level.
[Lower Decks]: Sir, I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousandkilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicateit could be the remains of a Federation escape pod. Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted aCardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captorand was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassianspace.
[Thine Own Self]: Then what do you believe I am?
[Thine Own Self]: Then I am not ill?
[Thine Own Self]: I am an ice man.
[Thine Own Self]: I am studying skin samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt toisolate the cause of the illness.
[Thine Own Self]: At the moment, I am looking for a common event or experience thatGia, Garvin and Skoran might have shared that could have a causalrelationship to their illness.
[Thine Own Self]: I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibilitythat I may in some way be the causal factor. However, since you havehad a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of thesickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate.
[Thine Own Self]: I do not know what I am. But I am not like you.
[Thine Own Self]: No. I am not.
[Thine Own Self]: I am afraid they will not believe you either. Gia, is the well inthe town square the only source of water for this village?
[Thine Own Self]: I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought Iwas on Barkon Four.
[Masks]: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for theeffect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We arestill picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable. At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours.
[Masks]: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation.
[Masks]: I do not know. I am different.
[Masks]: I believe so, sir. I am not entirely certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again?
[Masks]: Yes, sir. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alienpersonalities, in a sense, I am now empty.
[Eye of the Beholder]: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded inthis wall.
[Genesis]: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on severaloccasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run afull analysis on the kittens once they
[Genesis]: I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communicationchannel.
[Genesis]: The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading powerfluctuations on all decks.
[Genesis]: There are life signs. However, sensor readings are highlydistorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms.
[Genesis]: Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred differentvocalisations.
[Genesis]: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died. Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life formswithin the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one weobserved in Counsellor Troi.
[Genesis]: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans. However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, thecomputer in my quarters has an independent processing and memorystorage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there.
[Genesis]: Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them.
[Genesis]: The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am notcertain what would be an effective lure.
[Genesis]: I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands,where the pheromones are produced. I believe I can activate thepheromones with a bioactivant solution.
[Firstborn]: I am detecting a vessel holding position nearthe third planet. It is a Yridian freighter.
[Bloodlines]: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo'scurrent whereabouts.
[Bloodlines]: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they areall too young to be Miranda Vigo.
[Bloodlines]: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. Theindividual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath theplanet's surface.
[Bloodlines]: I am attempting to do so. The message reads, my revenge is athand.
[Bloodlines]: I am tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. Theship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometresfrom here.
[Emergence]: But sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magicalrite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual.
[Emergence]: Yes, sir. Captain, I am not certain I fully understand thisProspero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have thatwould improve my performance.
[Emergence]: If I am not mistaken.
[Emergence]: Bearing one eight seven mark four. I am unable to determine ourdestination, however we are heading away from the Mekorda sector.
[Emergence]: I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself.
[Emergence]: I am ready to access the main power grid.
[Emergence]: I am ready to depolarise the power grid.
[Emergence]: Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest this evening for asmall audience. I would like for you to attend.
[Preemptive Strike]: I am attempting to do so.
[Preemptive Strike]: Sir, I am scanning the area from which thedistress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did itcome to be used in contemporary language?
[All Good Things... Part I]: I am uncertain, sir. Sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Possibly. There is a great deal ofinterference, but I am getting some readings. This is very unusual.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I am preparing to initiate a static warp shell.

Picard
-------
[Encounter at Farpoint Part I]: Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open toguesses about what we've just met.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime,I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing todetach saucer section. so that families and the majority of the ship'scompany can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive,containing the battle bridge and main armaments, will turnback and confront the mystery that is threatening us.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me aship with children aboard.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every lifeform had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm lookingforward to meeting this Groppler Zorn.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For youto work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of aterrible personal tragedy.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no FarpointStation, if I'm right about this. Q
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

[The Naked Now]: I will? That's true. I started off calling you Beverly, and ofcourse, naturally, you. I'm still not thinking straight.
[Code of Honor]: I'm aware of that, Doctor.
[Code of Honor]: That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, thecustoms here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous,strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry,this is becoming a speech.
[The Last Outpost]: All I'm saying is that you removed something which clearly didnot belong to you.
[Where No One Has Gone Before]: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers.
[Lonely Among Us]: I'm Captain Picard. Welcome aboard. We hope your journey willbe pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my First Officer,Commander Riker.
[Lonely Among Us]: Well, I'm not satisfied. I want an explanation of this by thetime we reach Parliament.
[Lonely Among Us]: I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulsepower, Lieutenant?
[Lonely Among Us]: Oh? I'll be glad to do when I'm free.
[Lonely Among Us]: What's happened to your mind, Doctor? The search for knowledgeis always our primary mission. I'm sorry, I really am too busy for thiskind of nonsense. Do I have to call Security to force you to report tothe Sickbay?
[Justice]: I'm Captain Picard, commanding this Federation starship.
[Justice]: Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down.
[Justice]: I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was necessary. Do you know what thatis?
[Justice]: I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'msorry I had to. She was so frightened.
[Justice]: I'm truly sorry, Liator, but I must have justice for my peopletoo. Transporter room, energise.
[The Battle]: I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data?
[The Battle]: No, no. I'm fine
[The Battle]: It's right. I'm fine. What is this all about?
[The Battle]: He's my weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting quitecaught up in this.
[The Battle]: Oh, I'm fine, Doctor. Lieutenant Yar, run a structural analysison the Stargazer for an impulse tow. Data, download all computers tothe Enterprise and file. I'm going to look at my old cabin.
[The Battle]: The last three nights I've, I've heard these voices. I'm on thebridge of my old ship. There's fire all around me. The klaxons, smoke. And then I give the order. And now the Stargazer is really here!. Andthat log. Am I going crazy? How do I know I was in my right mind atMaxia? How do I know I'm in my right mind now?
[Hide and Q]: If this is Q I'm addressing, we are on a mission of rescuewhere a group of badly injured Q
[Hide and Q]: I'm sure your fellow Q remember you agreed to never trouble ourspecies again. Just as they're aware you failed to tempt a human tojoin you. Q
[Haven]: I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.
[Haven]: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother forthe fine Counsellor she
[Haven]: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant
[Haven]: I'll see what I can do. And now, if you will excuse me, I'msure the two of you have a lot to talk about.
[Haven]: Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard.
[Haven]: Our destiny is elsewhere. But I'm happy that yours is here withus, Counsellor.
[The Big Goodbye]: I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[The Big Goodbye]: You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm not dressedproperly. I'll be back.  LEECH
[The Big Goodbye]: I'm going to go again, only this time I'm going to dress thepart. Why not come with me?
[The Big Goodbye]: Well, if it's anything like the last time, I'm sure you won'tbe disappointed
[The Big Goodbye]: I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say,you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it.
[The Big Goodbye]: I'm very sorry, Mister Leech, but we have to be going. Callagain tomorrow.
[The Big Goodbye]: Well, I suppose a few moments longer. I'm afraid I can't helpyou, Mister Leech. The game is over.
[Datalore]: Assemble your away party, Commander. This must be an excitingmoment for you, Mister Data. I'm tempted to lead the away team myself,except that my First Officer would object.
[Datalore]: I'm also a bit troubled by it describingyou as imperfect.
[Datalore]: I'm asking that you keep an eye on your son during all of this,Doctor.
[Angel One]: This is quite unnecessary, Doctor. I'm fine.
[11001001]: Your reputation precedes you. I'm very pleased you're going tobe improving our system.
[11001001]: I'm sorry. This mission can't be delayed. If you want topostpone the work?
[11001001]: Bridge. Well, I have a little work tofinish up, then I'm going to my cabin. I'm going to put my feet up, I'mgoing to turn on my personal relaxation light and I'm going to losemyself in the pages of some old novel. What about you, Number One? You've earned a rest.
[11001001]: Oh, I'm sorry, Number One. I didn't mean to interrupt.
[Too Short a Season]: I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can beready, Admiral.
[Too Short a Season]: No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five yearsago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers.
[Too Short a Season]: Karnas, this is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you the Admiral iscritically ill.
[Too Short a Season]: I'm on my way.
[Home Soil]: I'm going to beam him out of there.
[Home Soil]: Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage, whatever. Theanswer's there, on the planet. Tasha, I want you to provide CounsellorTroi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests. Psychprofiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent, thepsychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another.
[Coming of Age]: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go onso long.
[Coming of Age]: It's not him I'm inclined to judge.
[Coming of Age]: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surelythere are others who are better suited.
[Coming of Age]: Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk.
[Heart of Glory]: Extraordinary. Now I'm beginning to understand him.
[Heart of Glory]: Still, there are some points that I'm not very clear about.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: Stand by. I'm coming down.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: I don't know. But don't worry. As soon as they realise ourcommunicators are not working, the sensors will find us and Geordi willbeam us up. Now, just you hold on. I'm sorry about this.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end. Stay awake.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt. It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative.
[Symbiosis]: I'm sorry.
[Symbiosis]: I'm not sure that I can.
[Symbiosis]: No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets,which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If Iwere to tell them any of this, I would violate that Prime Directive.
[Skin of Evil]: I'm beaming you up.
[Skin of Evil]: It has something to do with Counsellor Troi. Somehow when it'sdealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her. I'm going to beam down. Lieutenant Worf, you have the conn.
[Skin of Evil]: I'm not taking you anywhere. Captain's log, stardate 41602.1. The shuttlecrafthas been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving theplanet. Vagra Two will be declared off limits. But the damage has beendone. One of the saddest duties I've ever had to perform is now aheadof me.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: Here too. I'm on my way.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: I'm not very hungry. I really came for the view.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: Doctor Manheim, I'm Captain Picard.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: Yes, I can see that. I'm sure the Federation will want to helpin any way that it can.
[Conspiracy]: Very good, Number One. I'm on my way.
[Conspiracy]: Very well. Relay those coordinates to the transporter room. I'mbeaming down.
[Conspiracy]: I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood.
[Conspiracy]: I'm certain, Number One. I want you to stay close. Keep youreye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving hima full medical examination.
[Conspiracy]: I'm right.
[Conspiracy]: I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Commander Riker tojoin me as soon as he's ready. Picard out.
[The Neutral Zone]: I'm Captain Picard.
[The Neutral Zone]: Slow to half impulse. I'm on my way.
[The Child]: Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion withyour mother.
[The Child]: I'm not sure of your point.
[Where Silence Has Lease]: I'm not anything now, Number One. I'm just a man who's lookingfor answers.
[Where Silence Has Lease]: I'm not interested.
[The Outrageous Okona]: Mister Okona, you are free to socialise with the members of mycrew. I'm talking about a man named Debin.
[The Outrageous Okona]: I'm sure you do.
[The Outrageous Okona]: In truth, I simply do not have authority in this matter. I'mnot your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in mycustody, and that creates the dilemma.
[The Outrageous Okona]: According to Starfleet regulations, that would be my onlycourse of action. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm not doingyou a favour.
[Loud as a Whisper]: You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. ActuallyI'm looking forward to meeting this mediator.
[Loud as a Whisper]: I'm curious about how this rare form of communication cameabout.
[Loud as a Whisper]: I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing.
[Loud as a Whisper]: Can you write it out? I am so sorry that your friends werekilled. I'm sorry, I don't know what you are trying to tell me. We haveto find some way to communicate with him. Data, he knows some kind ofgestural language. Find our which one and learn it.
[The Schizoid Man]: I thought you might enjoy the Bridge, Miss Brianon. I'm awareof your interest in science. Perhaps you'd like to see the computerterminal
[The Schizoid Man]: I'm getting there. I'm going to have Engineering run a fullphysical on you.
[The Schizoid Man]: I'm afraid there are two more injuries in Engineering.
[Unnatural Selection]: I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, until we know what'sgoing on I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station.
[Unnatural Selection]: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless withoutrisk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it ifyou'd let me finish my sentences once in a while.
[Unnatural Selection]: Yes. I'm sorry.
[A Matter of Honor]: Well, I'm familiar with the practice of the feast before thetransfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made morepalatable choices.
[A Matter of Honor]: On viewscreen. I'm Captain Picard of the Enterprise.
[The Measure of a Man]: My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seemsreasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting.
[The Dauphin]: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard.
[The Dauphin]: We're accommodating you in quartersnormally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find themquite comfortable.
[Contagion]: Donald, we'll get our teams to work on it immediately. I'm sureneither of us feels too comfortable sitting around in the Neutral Zone.
[Contagion]: Shields up. Prepare a tractor beam. Mister La Forge, I'm goingto assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia.
[Contagion]: I'm going to capture it.
[Contagion]: We can't make that assumption. The effect on the Yamato wasdevastating, but what if it was by accident, not by design. What I'mgoing to say may sound unscientific, but standing on this soil,breathing in this air, my instincts tell me that we may have got themwrong.
[Contagion]: I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. Data, I have todestroy this. This control room and its technology must not be allowedto fall into Romulan hands.
[Contagion]: I'm standing directly in front of the gate. To my left there isa small triangular screen.
[Time Squared]: I'm fine, Doctor. Save your ministrations for your patient. Iwant a staff meeting in five minutes. Doctor, I assume you will want toremain here.
[Time Squared]: I'm on my way. You have the Bridge, NumberOne.
[Time Squared]: He knows I'm here.
[Time Squared]: You must tell me. What was it? You don't know what I'm talkingabout. You're locked into a single intent unable to change. Unable toalter any part of your previous actions. P2
[Pen Pals]: I'm on my way.
[Pen Pals]: Doctor, I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but ina situation like this, we have to be cautious. What we do today mayprofoundly affect upon the future. If we could see every possibleoutcome
[Q Who]: Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on.
[Samaritan Snare]: I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on.
[Samaritan Snare]: Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign, I didn'tmean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damnedcardiac replacement.
[Samaritan Snare]: I'm pleased to report that Ensign Crusher's Starfleet examresults permit him to continue his studies on board the Enterprise. Furthermore, any rumours of my brush with death are greatlyexaggerated. Is that clear?
[Up the Long Ladder]: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. Butdespite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager torenew ties.
[Manhunt]: Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise.
[Manhunt]: Your point is well taken, Mister Data. I'm sure that to theAntedeans, we are equally unattractive.
[Manhunt]: Data, this is fascinating. Don't you agree, Mrs. Troi? Commander, if your duties permit, why don't you join us for dessert? I'm sure that Mrs. Troi would much appreciate the pleasure of yourcompany.
[Manhunt]: Fascinating, Data, absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs. Troiwould love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition ofbrown dwarf stars.
[Manhunt]: I'm not amused, Number One. There must be some way to convinceher that it's quite impossible, without offending her.
[Manhunt]: I'm sorry to hear that.
[Manhunt]: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, this isn't what I wantedat all. It's much to violent. I'm here to relax, not to dodge bullets. Reconfigure.
[The Emissary]: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant
[The Emissary]: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want thembefore we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you tohelp the Emissary. Dismissed.
[The Emissary]: Lieutenant, I commend your diligence. However, I'm concernedthat you're working yourself too hard.
[Shades of Gray]: And deadly. I'm sorry.
[Shades of Gray]: I'm beaming you up.
[Shades of Gray]: I'm on my way.
[Shades of Gray]: I'm delighted that you're feeling better, Captain. The Admiraland I were worried about you.
[The Ensigns of Command]: Inhibited, I suppose. But then, I'm not Wesley. And if you areconcerned about him, I see no evidence that there is a problem.
[Evolution]: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrangetransport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to movequickly.
[Evolution]: I'm trying, but the needed ship will not be available for threeweeks.
[Evolution]: Is there nothing of Data in what I'm hearing? You see, youchose the violinists. Heifetz and Bronken have radically differentstyles, different techniques, yet you combined them successfully.
[The Survivors]: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm Jean-LucPicard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something youwill need if you're going to stay on Rana Four. It's a matterreplicator. It has limited capabilities, but
[The Survivors]: I'm not surprised. Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Warnthe vessel to stay clear of the planet.
[The Survivors]: I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. Ithink it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that willall change once I'm back on board.
[The Survivors]: It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes. Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure, butthat's what I'm going to put to the test.
[The Survivors]: Anything. Everything. I'll be in my Ready room if I'm needed. That will be all for now.
[The Survivors]: Your Captain is acting on an assumption, Will, and I'm not surewhat the result will be, or even that my assumption is correct. Wefound two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there wasonly one survivor of the war on Rana Four.
[Who Watches the Watchers]: I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But nowthat he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with theaway team.
[Who Watches the Watchers]: She believes the Picard is a magical figure. I'm going to showher how the magic works. I'm going to bring her aboard.
[Who Watches the Watchers]: I do not deserve it. Look at me. Look at me. Feel the warmth ofmy hand, the rhythm of my pulse. I'm not a supreme being. I'm flesh andblood, like you.
[The Bonding]: I'm told that your father is also dead.
[Booby Trap]: I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum. I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probablyinitiated over a thousand years ago. Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived atOrelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars andPromellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we havefound a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood thecenturies.
[The Price]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. I'm serving ashost for these proceedings.
[The Price]: Well, I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkwardtransition. You're the next likely choice. And Mister Mendozawill certainly agree. He's quite impressed by your natural instincts.
[The Vengeance Factor]: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you wouldbe demanding equal levels of representation.
[The Vengeance Factor]: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strongleaders.
[The Vengeance Factor]: With the Gatherer truce in effect, it certainly should be. Wewon't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extendshore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it.
[The Defector]: Well, I'm sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and you requiremedical attention. Lieutenant Worf, will you accompany SublieutenantSetal to the Sickbay. We will attend to your quarters.
[The Defector]: Admiral, have a seat. You see, I'm just not convinced that youare telling the truth.
[The Defector]: Commander Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we wereresponding to a warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana Three.
[The Hunted]: Well, I'm greatly impressed with everythingI've seen so far, Prime Minister.
[The Hunted]: Mister Danar, I'm transferring you to Angosian security. They're en route. They will arrive shortly. I wanted to tell you I haveno choice. The Prime Minister insisted and we have no right to refuse.
[Déjà Q]: I'm sorry, but I have to report that our first attempt torestore the moon to its proper orbit has failed.
[Déjà Q]: Q, I'm not going to play along with this. If you want tocontinue this charade, you can do it alone. Q
[Déjà Q]: Q, I'm not your father confessor. You will receive noabsolution from me. You have brought nothing but pain and suffering tothis crew. And I'm still not entirely convinced that all this isn'tyour latest attempt at a puerile joke. Q
[Déjà Q]: I'm sorry?
[A Matter of Perspective]: I shall want an answer to that. I'm sure the Tanugans will too.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Chief Investigator, welcome to theEnterprise. I'm Captain Picard. This is my First Officer, CommanderWilliam Riker.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation betweenthem.
[A Matter of Perspective]: I'm saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, Iwill release my officer into your custody.
[Yesterday's Enterprise]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
[Yesterday's Enterprise]: I think I'm aware of your opinion, Commander. This is abriefing. I'm not seeking your consent.
[The Offspring]: Data! I'm not talking about parenting. I am talking about theextraordinary consequences of creating new life.
[The Offspring]: I see no need for it to be difficult at all. I understand yourconcerns. What I'm asking for is time, patience. If you have an openmind, I'm sure you will see that it is imperative that Data and Lal bekept together during the formative stages of her development. Afterthat, I have no doubt Commander Data will be delighted to deliver herto Starfleet Research.
[The Offspring]: I'm convinced the damage will be irreparable if they'reseparated.
[Sins of the Father]: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I'm Captain Picard. This is Commander William Riker. He will be yielding the firstofficer's position to you during your tour.
[Sins of the Father]: No. If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respectedmember of my crew, could be accused of a capital crime. Your actions inthis matter will reflect on this ship and on the Federation. Therefore,it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your sidewhile you make your challenge. I'm sure you would do no less for me.
[Sins of the Father]: I'm not here to command.
[Sins of the Father]: No, she survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going tofind her.
[Sins of the Father]: Hey, I'm your cha'DIch.
[Allegiance]: It's all right, it's al right. I'm not going to hurt you.
[Allegiance]: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up withsome explanation for your abduction.
[Allegiance]: As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy.
[Allegiance]: I don't think I told you, but I'm glad you're back on theEnterprise. I missed our friendship.
[Allegiance]: Good. Because I'm delighted you did. But, perhaps we shouldcall it a night. 2
[Allegiance]: I'm under no obligation to tell you that.
[Allegiance]: Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the onewith the problem? I'm aware you've been under stress, and I am willingto let the matter drop if you will report to Sickbay for a fullexamination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Thinkabout it.
[Allegiance]: So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing anyfurther. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, thisexperiment is over!
[Captain's Holiday]: Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. Resume.
[Captain's Holiday]: Oh, I'm sure.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm the captain of a Federation starship.
[Captain's Holiday]: What? I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor from thefuture who left behind a mysterious device known as the Tox Uthat.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't found anything,including peace, which is the only thing I'm looking for.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm sure of it.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm sorry, Vash. Would you have brought me here if I had toldyou?
[Tin Man]: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm
[Tin Man]: Mister Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up theLife Sciences on this mission.
[Tin Man]: Mister Elbrun, one of the reasons I'm asking you to workclosely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardlytrivial. And yet
[Hollow Pursuits]: I'm not accustomed to seeing anunsatisfactory rating for one of my crew.
[The Most Toys]: I'm sure you have done a complete investigation, and if youwish to continue it, of course you have my support. But we shall bereaching the Beta Agni system shortly, and I expect you to be rested.
[Sarek]: I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old. But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they?
[Sarek]: I hope I'm not intruding.
[Sarek]: Not a task that I'm looking forward to.
[Sarek]: I'm sorry.
[Sarek]: I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only logical solution.
[Sarek]: I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation. Your company is much appreciated.
[Ménage à Troi]: I'm sure Counsellor Troi appreciates the opportunity to spendtime with her mother.
[Ménage à Troi]: Counsellor Troi had the good sense to ask for shore leave. Ican see I'm going to have to suggest it to you. Have a good time,Number One.
[Ménage à Troi]: I'm just thinking that I'm saying goodbye to you as you aretoday.
[Transfigurations]: I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be inthat escape pod, or what happened to the ship?
[Transfigurations]: I'm not forgetting that. That's the reason he's here and not inthe brig.
[Transfigurations]: I'm on my way. I want him kept under constant surveillance.
[Transfigurations]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the United Federation ofPlanets. We do not intend transgression of
[Transfigurations]: You understand the difficult position in which I'm placed.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will, you'reready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And, youknow, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: I'm on my way, Lieutenant.
[Family]: Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,I'm better. The injuries are healing.
[Family]: I'm sure you misunderstood.
[Family]: Oh, I'm fine.
[Family]: No. he does not. I'm here to rest and spend some time with myfamily.
[Family]: I'm tired of fighting with you, Robert.
[Family]: I'm not a hero.
[Suddenly Human]: Well, I'm sure you'll see there's nothinghere to appeal to a young person.
[Suddenly Human]: Look, Counsellor, I just feel that I'm not the right person forthis job.
[Suddenly Human]: I'm not cringing. I'm just acknowledging my limitations.
[Suddenly Human]: Are you saying that's what I'm going to have to do?
[Suddenly Human]: Hey, hey! You stay put. I'm on my way, Number One.
[Suddenly Human]: You see, I'm not convinced the boy has been abused, Doctor. I've talked with the father, and if I am any judge of character, Iwould say that he deeply cares for the boy's welfare.
[Suddenly Human]: Yes. There is something else to keep in mind. We are deep inTalarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. I'm goingto agree to the meeting.
[Suddenly Human]: I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like?
[Remember Me]: One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you are aware of the procedureinvolving passengers.
[Remember Me]: I'm sorry, whom did you say?
[Legacy]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
[Legacy]: Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw TashaYar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach awounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as hadmine. When it was all over, I requested that she be assigned to theEnterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour. In the months thatfollowed, she never once failed to put the safety of the crew beforeher own, and she died doing the same. I'm sorry you never knew thewoman Tasha became. I think you would have been proud of her. And sheof you.
[Reunion]: I'm sorry, I can't discuss it.
[Reunion]: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We areready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess whileI review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about theexplosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuingyour investigations?
[Future Imperfect]: I apologise for interrupting yourcelebration, but I'm going to need an away team. Could you report tothe Bridge, please?
[Future Imperfect]: I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategicimportance of Outpost twenty three is minimal. Has been for years.
[Final Mission]: Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get a signalthrough this strong a magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If asearch party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for thosemountains.
[Final Mission]: I'm not going to let you waste this. This is more valuable tous as a coolant or disinfectant.
[Final Mission]: Well done. I'm going to be fine. I just need to get my breath.
[Final Mission]: Mister Dirgo, I would appreciate it if you didn't bury mebefore I'm gone.
[Final Mission]: Wesley, listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. Myvision is blurred. I'm going to get worse, not better. I'm not going tobe able to help you. Now, you are going to have to stand up to Dirgo onyour own.
[Final Mission]: Good. Thank you. I'm not much good to you, Wesley.
[Final Mission]: I'm trying.
[Final Mission]: I was selfish. I thought I wouldn't see you again. I'm sorry.
[The Loss]: I'm sure that after a while you'll be able to adjust. They saywhen one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to compensate. A blind man develops better hearing.
[Data's Day]: I'm aware of that, Number One. Proceed.
[The Wounded]: I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I wouldprefer to make the initial contact myself. I'm sure you would, if thesituation were reversed.
[Devil's Due]: Method acting? I'm vaguely familiar with it, but why would youchoose such an old-fashioned approach?
[Devil's Due]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Is there nothing you can do?
[Devil's Due]: No. I'm going down to the planet myself.
[Devil's Due]: No, that's true. I'm not Ardra. but I can create tremors justas she did.
[Clues]: I'm sorry about this Gu, Gloria. I didn't actually mean you toget involved. She knows nothing about this, Johnny.
[Clues]: I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a twenty-fourth century mysteryI have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like.
[Clues]: I'm not sure, Mister Worf. I have never known Data to tell alie, and yet.
[Clues]: I'm on my way to Engineering. Join me.
[Clues]: I'm on my way.
[Clues]: Then, Mister Data, I'm going to ask you again, and I order youto directly answer me. What really happened to us?
[Clues]: Granted, but I'm beginning to suspect that Commander Data isrefusing to co-operate because he believes he is acting in the bestinterests of the Enterprise.
[Clues]: Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not surethat you will be able to integrate it into yourprogramme.
[First Contact]: It's certainly no joke. As you can see, we are physically quitedifferent from Malcorians. And, with your permission, I'm prepared toprove it to you.
[The Nth Degree]: I'm willing to entertain suggestions.
[The Nth Degree]: I'm glad you could join us, Mister Barclay. Your report, Mister La Forge.
[The Nth Degree]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise.
[Qpid]: It will need to be. Tomorrow I'll be addressing some of thegreatest scientific minds in the Federation. Switzer,Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland. Giants in the field of archaeology. Compared to them I'm just an enthusiastic amateur.
[Qpid]: I'm that glad you approve.
[Qpid]: I'm sorry if you're upset.
[Qpid]: I'm in no mood for your foolishness, Q. Q
[Qpid]: I'm not from Nottingham.
[The Drumhead]: I'm willing to wager that you trounced your brothers duringthose debates.
[The Drumhead]: I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid.
[The Drumhead]: Thank you, Doctor. If you have a case to make againstTarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here andnow.
[Half a Life]: Doctor Timicin. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge.
[Half a Life]: I'm afraid I have no choice.
[Half a Life]: Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but whatever my personal feelings, I haveno jurisdiction here. I simply cannot interfere.
[Half a Life]: I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that.
[The Host]: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful.
[The Host]: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to theshuttlebay?
[The Host]: Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I am your friend. I canonly imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know I'mhere.
[In Theory]: I'm going to pilot the shuttle.
[In Theory]: Enterprise, I'm losing manoeuvrability.
[In Theory]: I'm re-routing the secondary deuteriumsupply. Switching to manual control.
[In Theory]: I'm a little dizzy, Number One, but none the worse. I'm onmy way.
[Redemption, Part I]: No, that won't be necessary, Mister Worf. I'm not here as yourcaptain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the HighCouncil. Your cha'DIch. We will arrive at your home world in less thana day.
[Redemption, Part I]: Mister Worf. Here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interestwhile I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. Do you think Iwish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see for myself the implications for theFederation? Good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! All of myinstincts, my training, my very being as a Starfleet officer are atodds with my responsibilities as Arbiter of the Klingon High Council. We walk the same tightrope between two worlds, you and I. We must tryour very best to keep those two worlds separate, or we shall certainlyfall.
[Redemption, Part I]: Mister Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle ofnon interference. As Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath touphold that principle whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I mustrefuse your request.
[Redemption, Part I]: Mister Worf. I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. TheEnterprise will be leaving this sector immediately.
[Redemption, Part II]: I'm afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here. Iwant to reassure you that we have no hostile intention.
[Redemption, Part II]: Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing in my experience canpersuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know onething. It will not affect my judgment at our next encounter.
[Darmok]: Enough! I'm not going to fight you. You'll just have to
[Darmok]: My turn? No, I'm not much of a story teller. Besides, youwouldn't understand. Shaka. when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn'tmatter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancientone, from Earth. I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king. Gilgamesh, a king, at Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made themangry. They cried out aloud, send us a companion for our king. Spare usfrom his madness. Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city. They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgameshdefeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu atUruk.
[Ensign Ro]: Lay in a new course. I'm on my way.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm sorry, I didn't know. RO
[Ensign Ro]: I'm fully aware of your Starfleet record, your problems onother ships, and the incident on Garon Two that led to your courtmartial. And I'm concerned about your presence on this delicatemission. RO
[Ensign Ro]: I'm pleased you agreed to meet with us, Mister Keeve.
[Ensign Ro]: Well, I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but Ican offer you assistance.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm pleased. We will report as soon as our mission isaccomplished. Picard out.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm pleased to hear that, Gul Dolak, for all of us in theFederation value the peaceful relations with our Cardassian neighbours.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm sorry to offend you, Gul Dolak, but we cannot withdraw.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm not convinced of that.
[Ensign Ro]: No. I'm not willing to give them up.
[Ensign Ro]: Well, I just see a different big picture, Admiral. It lookssomething like this. I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassianvirus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion Four. Nowwe have a common enemy, he says. The Bajoran terrorists. TheCardassians can't find them, but maybe the Federation can. I'mbeginning to see that our mission has, in fact, been to expose Orta sothat the Cardassians can move in and destroy him.
[Ensign Ro]: I'm not sure. A hearing, certainly. Probably a court martial. RO
[Disaster]: No, I'm afraid not. But we will be visiting the hydroponics andastrophysics laboratories.
[Disaster]: Your name is Marissa. Is that right? Well, Marissa, I'm goingto need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest and so that makesyou my Number One.
[Disaster]: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frere Jacques. That'sa song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know thatone? Good. It goes like this. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormezvous? Dormez vous?
[The Game]: Will, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure that all sciencedepartments have an equal chance of completing their research.
[Unification, Part I]: I'm sorry. It's a classified matter.
[Unification, Part I]: I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in heretogether.
[Unification, Part I]: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock.
[Unification, Part II]: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'mlooking for Ambassador Spock.
[Unification, Part II]: If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussionsto the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'mhere as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me.
[Unification, Part II]: Nevertheless, sir, I'm not prepared to leave until your affairsare completed.
[Unification, Part II]: Then I'm in good company, sir.
[A Matter of Time]: I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which isslowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm toldthat in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die.
[A Matter of Time]: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask youthat. But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, andyou know what happened to them. What will happen to them.
[A Matter of Time]: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do Iask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday onCorsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of athousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believethat if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is myfuture and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet.
[A Matter of Time]: I'm afraid we're going to have to take a look in your vessel.
[A Matter of Time]: I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians atStarfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era. Oh,Professor. Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

[Violations]: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularlygood subject.
[Violations]: Suspect is perhaps too strong a word. I'm simply trying todetermine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas.
[Violations]: I'm on my way.
[Violations]: We're not certain. It may be that there is some unusual effectproduced by the Ullians' telepathic activity. I'm going to talk tothem, and in the meantime, you're to stay here and recuperate. And ifyou remember anything at all about what happened, I want you to tell meimmediately.
[Violations]: I'm simply considering all possibilities.
[Violations]: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to apotentially dangerous procedure.
[Violations]: I'm not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution. Memory invasion is simply not a crime we've ever had to contend with.
[Violations]: We'll inform the medical personnel on thoseplanets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas. I'm surethey'll appreciate knowing what
[The Masterpiece Society]: I'm afraid we're going to have to evacuate your people.
[The Masterpiece Society]: I'm sure. Will he leave when he sees there's no other choice?
[Conundrum]: I'm aware of that, Commander. Tactical analysis, Mister Data.
[Conundrum]: But I also can't ignore that we have greatly outclassed theonly enemy vessel we've encountered. And that everysingle possible shred of information which might shed some light onthis situation has been conveniently eliminated. I feel as though I'vebeen handed a weapon, sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger. Well, I need some moral context to justify that action, and I don'thave it. I'm not content simply to obey orders. I need to know thatwhat I am doing is right.
[Power Play]: Number One, so long as they're on board this ship, I'm ahostage no matter where I am. We all are. I must find out who we'redealing with. If La Forge and Ro can attempt a rescue in short order,then let them proceed. If they can't, I will provide you with anotheropportunity. Watch for it.
[Power Play]: I'm very pleased to hear that.
[Ethics]: Will. Look, I'm sorry, I cannot help you to make this decision, but I can tell you this. Klingons choose their friends with great care. If he didn't know he could count on you, he never would have asked.
[Ethics]: Doctor? I'm on my way to look in on your patient.
[The Outcast]: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do.
[Cause and Effect]: I'm on my way.
[Cause and Effect]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. We were just going to ask you the same thing.
[The First Duty]: I'm not certain.
[The First Duty]: I understand. But I just want you to know I'm available if youshould change your mind.
[The First Duty]: I'm afraid that never gets easier.
[The First Duty]: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous childplaying on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew everycontrol, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on theBridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, Iwas convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've neverquestioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of everyStarfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, orhistorical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle uponwhich Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to standup and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wearthat uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place,or I will.
[Cost of Living]: We may not have five hours and twenty minutes. I'm aware ofthat. How can we slow them down?
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm the Captain of the ship. What is it you want?
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm afraid I require an explanation, Ambassador.
[The Perfect Mate]: Nothing. Nothing lies beneath. I'm really quite dull. I fallasleep each night with an old book in my hands.
[The Perfect Mate]: Oh, I'm not taking it lightly. I'm just trying to be as dull aspossible.
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm sorry.
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing forsome dreaded recital.
[The Perfect Mate]: I', doing my best, although I'm finding some of the ritualsquite demanding.
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm sorry.
[I, Borg]: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you.
[I, Borg]: I'm not sure. I hope so.
[I, Borg]: No, I'm delighted to see you. Can I get you something to drink?
[The Inner Light]: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me.
[The Inner Light]: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet?
[The Inner Light]: I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It mightgive a clue to the cause of this drought.
[The Inner Light]: I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music.
[The Inner Light]: No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morningwas absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and youhave given me so much.
[The Inner Light]: No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you.
[The Inner Light]: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. JR
[The Inner Light]: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future.
[The Inner Light]: Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long?
[The Inner Light]: Yes. Yes, thank you. But I find I'm having to rediscover thatthis is really my home.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth toinvestigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home?
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: If you have something to say, I'm listening.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here.
[Man of the People]: Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead and beam your passengers onboard. Counsellor, after you've seen to their needs will you escortthem to my Ready room.
[Man of the People]: Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you'remistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocentbecause you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasantemotions. Well, this time you will be held accountable. I'm taking youback to the Enterprise to release Counsellor Troi.
[Relics]: It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that youhaven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist calledFreeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow spherecould be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage ofharnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living onthe interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources ofpower.
[Relics]: I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, CaptainScott.
[Relics]: I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to hearyou talk about your career. I'm sure you would have some fascinatinginsights into the events of your time.
[Relics]: I hope I'm not interrupting. I was just coming off duty and Iwanted to see how you were doing.
[True Q]: Welcome to the Enterprise, Miss Rogers. I'm delighted to have you aboard.
[True Q]: I'm convinced that Q isn't telling us everything. See what youcan find out.
[True Q]: If I'm not mistaken, she just did.
[True Q]: Send us your design specifications I'm sure we'll be able tohelp.
[True Q]: I'm on my way.
[Rascals]: I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well,thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't really take myselfseriously like this. Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, arethey?
[Rascals]: I'm okay.
[A Fistful of Datas]: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don'thave the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not muchof an actor.
[The Quality of Life]: The Enterprise is scheduled to leave the Tyran system tomorrow. If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a very good reason.
[The Quality of Life]: I'm inclined to agree. I don't think that forty eight hours istoo much time to risk particularly when the gains areso substantial. You may proceed, Doctor.
[The Quality of Life]: I'm reading power fluctuations. The force field is not stable.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: I'm sorry, I can't tell you that yet.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: Mister Worf, I have my orders. I'm sure you understand that. Now Doctor, this deflector wasn't set properly. It must be positionedso that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway, or it'suseless.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: Yes, I am. The last time I had to train like this was for theAcademy marathon, but I'm managing. What can I do for you?
[Chain of Command, Part I]: I'm not accusing you of anything.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: Looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I'm pickingup three proximity sensors around it.
[Chain of Command, Part II]: I'm surprised that you let her come in here.
[Aquiel]: I'm merely saying that I'm following up on evidence that myofficers discovered on board.
[Aquiel]: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn'tknow what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take thismatter up with Gowron. I'm really sorry that we bothered you.
[Aquiel]: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiterof Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here andinvestigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer.
[Aquiel]: If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind ifwe spoke with him.
[Tapestry]: If I'm really dead, then my only regret is dying and findingyou here. Q
[Tapestry]: Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little disoriented, that's all.
[Tapestry]: Yes, I'm fine. Really, Marta, I'm fine.
[Tapestry]: So, Q, I thought you told me that I was dead. Now it seems thatI'm alive. Q
[Tapestry]: I'm just a little more contemplative.
[Tapestry]: I'm sorry to disappoint you. Q
[Tapestry]: Perhaps it's just that I'm getting older.
[Tapestry]: Corey, I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you frommaking a serious mistake.
[Tapestry]: I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon.
[Tapestry]: I'm not sure. Mister Worf, what is my rank and position?
[Tapestry]: Beverly, something's happened to me. I'mnot sure Q
[Tapestry]: I'm on my way, sir.
[Tapestry]: There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. Therewere loose threads, untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. Butwhen I pulled on one of those threads it unraveled the tapestry of mylife.
[Birthright, Part I]: Not at all. I'm here studying the intricacies of Bajoranaqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please, sit down.
[Birthright, Part I]: I'm curious, Mister Data. Why are you looking at all theseother cultures?
[Starship Mine]: Tell him I'm looking forward to it.
[Starship Mine]: My name is Mot. I'm the barber.
[Starship Mine]: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send yourregrets.
[Lessons]: No need to report. I'm just here to do some work on my own.
[Lessons]: Yes. I understand it has unusual radioactive emissions, and I'msure that Stellar Sciences will find it a most interesting study.
[Lessons]: No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in thatarpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect.
[Lessons]: No, please, come in. I'm delighted.
[Lessons]: I'm not very good.
[Lessons]: I'm sorry.
[Lessons]: I'm really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift. When the crewmember walked in, I felt very self-conscious. It's goingto take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the twoof us together.
[Lessons]: I can assure you that I'm not given to casual relationships. There is something that I want to tell you. But nothere.
[Lessons]: No, I'm not surprised. Its sun went nova more than a thousandyears ago.
[Lessons]: All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of. But you mustn't compromise yourself. You must do what you have to do. Because if I find that my head of Stellar Sciences isn't beingeffective, then I shall do what I must to do and I shall replace her.
[Lessons]: I'm on my way. Captain's log, stardate 46693.1. We have enteredthe Bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate theFederation outpost on the third planet.
[Lessons]: I'm on my way.
[Lessons]: I'm so sorry.
[The Chase]: I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I haveresponsibilities.
[The Chase]: No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But theProfessor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices insidethe one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voiceinside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that.
[The Chase]: Professor, I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn'tsomething that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go forgood. It's not something I'm not prepared to do.
[The Chase]: I'm aware of the Federation's timetable, Number One. ProfessorGalen visited here a few days ago. And he was on his way to Indri Eightwhen he was killed. There's some connection between these two planets. I'm going to find it.
[Suspicions]: Beverly. I'm afraid there will be no autopsy. The family hasalready been contacted. They insist that the body must not be toucheduntil they perform the Ferengi death ritual.
[Suspicions]: Please believe me, they're adamant. We are scheduled torendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will pick upReyga's body then. I'm sorry, there will be no autopsy.
[Suspicions]: You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that thefamily would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, butyou've interfered in the burial rituals of another culture. You've putboth of us in a very difficult position. The family will have to benotified. I don't doubt that they will react strongly. If the Ferengigovernment becomes involved, as I'm certain they will, this could havevery significant repercussions. I'm not sure how much I can protectyou.
[Suspicions]: I'm not surprised.
[Second Chances]: He was alone down there for a long time. I'm hesitant to lethim go back until he's been evaluated.
[Second Chances]: I'm sure that Lieutenant Riker will be happy to help you withthat.
[Timescape]: I'm wary about making changes in this time continuum until weunderstand more about what's going on.
[Timescape]: I'm bringing the runabout in.
[Descent, Part I]: I'm going to contact Starfleet Command.
[Descent, Part I]: I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers! I'm sorry. Hewas in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortalthreat, and I let him go.
[Descent, Part I]: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up acommand post and begin mapping out a search plan.
[Descent, Part II]: I'm not particularly impressed. All you've done is teach themto enjoy killing.
[Descent, Part II]: I'm not sure that's true.
[Liaisons]: Ambassador Loquel, Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome on board the Enterprise.
[Liaisons]: How do you do. I'm looking forward very much to meeting withthe Premier of Iyar. There will be a reception held in your honour whenyou will meet the rest of my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on myway to your home world, but I shall be leaving you in the safe hands ofmy most experienced officers. Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire,is my head of Security. He will be in charge of your safety whileyou're on board. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will beyour personal liaison office, Ambassador Loquel.
[Liaisons]: So, I understand that your homeworld hassome of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Isthere any place in particular that you would recommend I visit whileI'm there?
[Liaisons]: There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings abouttwo kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Doyou understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back assoon as I can.
[Liaisons]: How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you'recertainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What'syour name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer.
[Liaisons]: No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge thispower cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energyrelays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one morecharge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate theshuttlecraft's engines.
[Liaisons]: Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder, I'm going totry to repair these energy relays.
[Liaisons]: Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think thatyou are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathyfor what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don'tthink that you can really be in love with me.
[Liaisons]: No, I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'mbringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that youcould possibly be just a little confused right now?
[Liaisons]: I'm feeling very much better. in fact, I don't intend to go onusing this any longer.
[Liaisons]: I'm going to go look for the shuttle myself.
[Interface]: No, no, I'm sorry, Geordi. I'm not prepared to risk your life. Data, find another way of salvaging the Raman. I want an alternate planin two hours.
[Interface]: I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made.
[Interface]: Dismissed. Geordi? I'm very sorry that you didn't find yourmother.
[Gambit, Part I]: I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of theidentification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person toanalyse these artefacts. Baran knows that.
[Gambit, Part I]: I'm configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse. If I can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency,I should be able to take it out with one shot. Firing. Their shieldsare down.
[Gambit, Part II]: You can tell Baran that I'm working as fast as I can. What?
[Gambit, Part II]: What a tangled web we weave. I have difficulty rememberingwhose side I'm on. So, what have you been able to find out?
[Gambit, Part II]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
[Gambit, Part II]: Maintain our present course and speed for now. I'm going tofind out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo.
[Gambit, Part II]: I'm really anxious to see the final artefact, because it mightprovide a valuable insight into Vulcan mythology.
[Gambit, Part II]: That's quite right. And as I'm supposed to be dead, I'll go andget some sleep. And, Mister Data, I suggest that you escort CommanderRiker to the brig.
[Phantasms]: No, no, certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it.
[Dark Page]: I'm asking you. That is an order, Counsellor.
[Dark Page]: And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth.
[Attached]: No. I'm really sorry. I don't.
[Attached]: You have? I'm really sorry.
[Attached]: Maybe if we put some distance between us, that might weaken it. Not that I'm growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts.
[Attached]: I'm beginning to realise that you seem to always have someacerbic remark on the tip of your tongue.
[Attached]: I'm all right.
[Force of Nature]: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listento your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is therecovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore ourengines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. Ifyou do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to thenearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done.
[Force of Nature]: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor. I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now.
[The Pegasus]: Oh, er, yes. It's, er, it's for the children. I'm, er, ha, ha,I'm a role model.
[The Pegasus]: Yes. Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for aCommander Riker Day next month. I'm even considering making an entrymyself.
[The Pegasus]: I'm taking this up with you, Will! The Judge Advocate thoughtyou were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Now, whatthe hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why isPressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later?
[The Pegasus]: Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force youto disobey his orders. Therefore I will have to remain in the dark onthis mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not letPressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that thattrust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the commandstructure of this ship. Dismissed.
[The Pegasus]: Admiral, if is passage narrows to less than five hundredmetres, I will abort the mission. You can charge me withinsubordination if you wish, but I'm not going to risk the Enterprisefor a salvage operation.
[The Pegasus]: Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treatyof Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf?
[Homeward]: I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can have full use ofthe ship's computer to set up a comm. link and upload your data fromhere. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed.
[Homeward]: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that wehave another option. Very well, let's give it a try.
[Sub Rosa]: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, butwe could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time.
[Sub Rosa]: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressiveaccomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands.
[Sub Rosa]: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scotsyourself. What was it that drew you here?
[Sub Rosa]: Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm reallyanxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,but two of the Howard women.
[Sub Rosa]: I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery.
[Lower Decks]: I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record.
[Lower Decks]: Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at theAcademy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelledfor what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on boardthis ship. You're dismissed.
[Lower Decks]: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm notordering you to take part in it.
[Masks]: I'm not going to hurt you.
[Masks]: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm notgoing to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister LaForge, do you have any ideas?
[Masks]: I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between thisculture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going toimprovise. Mister Worf, what's our status?
[Masks]: I'm afraid that will take some time to explain. Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forgehas managed to disable the alien transformationprogramme. Starfleet hasdispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further.
[Genesis]: Adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotationrate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually.
[Genesis]: I'm going to check the status of the warp core.
[Genesis]: Yes, I'm
[Journey's End]: It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that certainsacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfatherunderstood.
[Journey's End]: I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, andthis happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it canhave
[Journey's End]: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
[Firstborn]: But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take partin that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich culturalheritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival.
[Bloodlines]: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Mirandadecided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surpriseme. She was very independent, very strong willed.
[Bloodlines]: That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard.
[Bloodlines]: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against hislife. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here becauseyou're in danger.
[Bloodlines]: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find outone way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test?
[Bloodlines]: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much asurprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would haveliked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. Youlook a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like tomake one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. Ifshe had, I would have been part of your life.
[Bloodlines]: I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers Ihave no idea what's underneath.
[Bloodlines]: I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has astarship, he has technology.
[Bloodlines]: Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled asyou, but I'm not inexperienced.
[Bloodlines]: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'msorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back.
[Bloodlines]: Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've foundout that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it'sonly petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I hadbeen part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now.
[Bloodlines]: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any waywe can protect him?
[Bloodlines]: I'm so sorry.
[Bloodlines]: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, butit means something. There's some connection.
[Bloodlines]: I'm glad to hear it.
[Emergence]: Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you.
[Preemptive Strike]: Change course to intercept. I'm on my way. I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant.
[Preemptive Strike]: Gul Evek. I'm sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner.
[Preemptive Strike]: I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money. Captain's log, supplemental. We have received wordfrom Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will beattacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position inthe Hugora Nebula to wait for them.
[All Good Things... Part I]: 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm movingback and forth through time.
[All Good Things... Part I]: You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking upfrom a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of theEnterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then itall changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in thefuture, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't rememberwhat it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run itscourse.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What wereyou saying?
[All Good Things... Part I]: No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints andspecifications, but this will be my first time aboard.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm sure she is.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I wastalking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. Iwas in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the IrumodicSyndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's notthat. And I'm not daydreaming either.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can preventthe deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,that all this is just a delusion.
[All Good Things... Part I]: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worfthat I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyaltythan rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you'renot the Worf once I knew.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief.
[All Good Things... Part I]: They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the twoof you will find some way to deal with the situation.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, thetachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different timeperiods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I meanwhen the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I meaneverything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like thechicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it startedin the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That'swhy it's getting larger in the past.
[All Good Things... Part I]: The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do.

[Encounter at Farpoint Part I]: I'm willing, Doctor. Although we're not officially part of theEnterprise, I thought there might be something useful we can do whilewe wait.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: I'm sorry, Counsellor, but you must. We needmore information.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: Hang on, I'm coming. Enterprise, lock usonto her signal.
[Encounter at Farpoint Part II]: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain.
[The Naked Now]: Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay.
[The Naked Now]: Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm on my way. You'llhave to handle this.
[Code of Honor]: Strongly emphasized. And you can see it in the precise,ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lieutenant Yar too,sir, but maybe we should sit and wait them out. Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full dayof waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether theyare aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we havepinpointed Lutan's government compound.
[Code of Honor]: And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar,and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable ofkilling. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir.
[The Last Outpost]: I'm afraid I agree, Captain. They have not responded.
[The Last Outpost]: I wonder, Captain. I'm not usually one for distrust at firstsight, but this may be an exception.
[The Last Outpost]: I'm Commander William Riker, First Officer of the USSEnterprise. You have a lot to learn.
[Where No One Has Gone Before]: Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski. I'm theFirst Officer, Commander William Riker, and this is
[Where No One Has Gone Before]: I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley. I am looking forward tohearing about it. But not right now.
[Lonely Among Us]: But I'm afraid we're going to have to find our solution withouthistory's greatest Consulting Detective.
[Lonely Among Us]: Sir, I'm puzzled about your reversing our course.
[The Battle]: I'm certain the Ferengi are behind the faked log. No wonderthey're waiting out there. Headache back, sir?
[The Battle]: He's beamed himself aboard the Stargazer, and I'm wondering ifthis has something to do with it.
[Hide and Q]: I'm afraid that was me, Worf. I was checking to see if thephasers still operate.
[Hide and Q]: I can't. I'm prevented from that by a promise.
[Hide and Q]: All right, he stays. Because I've been given unusual powers, Iam not suddenly a monster. Except for these abilities, and I don't yetknow how far they go, I'm the same William T. Riker you've alwaysknown. Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable.
[Haven]: Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry.
[The Big Goodbye]: No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screencommunication so we can see each other
[The Big Goodbye]: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeckthree.
[Datalore]: I've guided his training, sir, I'm the one at fault. You willshow the proper respect. I will accompany you down there to makecertain of it. With your approval, of course, sir.
[Angel One]: I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do.
[Angel One]: Why? Because I'm only a man?
[11001001]: I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's probably nothing.
[11001001]: Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You've got the Bridge. Keepyour eye on them.
[11001001]: I'm going to have to leave for a while to see to my duties.
[11001001]: It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. Shealready knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself.
[When the Bough Breaks]: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories aboutAldea, thewondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman ofXerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needsfor all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to artand culture.
[Coming of Age]: I don't know, Geordi, but I'm going to find out. Right now.
[Coming of Age]: I'm available, Mister Remmick.
[The Arsenal of Freedom]: No, I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right.
[Symbiosis]: Two are lost, sir. But we saved four. I'm Commander WilliamRiker of the Enterprise. I'm sorry we were unable to rescue theother two. We did everything we could. If you had come instead ofsending your cargo, you all would have made it.
[Symbiosis]: My insides are still shaking, but I'm all right.
[Skin of Evil]: I'm not sure yet. There appears to be some kind of a slickblocking our path. Will keep you apprised.
[We'll Always Have Paris]: Yes, but without his help, I'm not sure we'll be able to poseany intelligent questions, let alone come up with any solutions.
[Conspiracy]: Captain, I'm sorry to disturb you.
[Conspiracy]: I must say I'm not overjoyed to see Remmick again.
[The Neutral Zone]: I'm not sure I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we shouldassume the initiative.
[The Child]: When we leave 'audet Nine, I'm going to need all the power youcan slam into those warp engines. LAFORGE
[The Child]: I'm not surprised. How did you respond?
[Where Silence Has Lease]: I'm going with Worf on this one. Let's be careful.
[Where Silence Has Lease]: I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir.
[The Outrageous Okona]: Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. If you'llturn over the inoperative part to Commander Data, we can begin repairs.
[Loud as a Whisper]: Transporter room five. I'm still a littleuncomfortable with your leading this away team.
[Loud as a Whisper]: I'm sure we won't. Energise.  SCHOLAR
[Loud as a Whisper]: I'm still not comfortable leaving you here alone.
[A Matter of Honor]: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your First Officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will stepoutside follow Lieutenant Lewis. He will assign you to your crewquarters. Ensign, you're here on the exchangeprogramme. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher.
[A Matter of Honor]: No, I'm not.
[A Matter of Honor]: I'm just an average, everyday human who happens to be a Commander. Now, what were your orders?
[A Matter of Honor]: I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir.
[A Matter of Honor]: I'm not that hungry.
[A Matter of Honor]: No, sir, I'm sure they all died with honour.
[A Matter of Honor]: That's why I'm here.
[A Matter of Honor]: Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Captain Kargan. He wasacting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Serve this shipas I have!
[A Matter of Honor]: You come from a very brave and unique people. I'm glad you'rewith us on the Enterprise.
[The Measure of a Man]: You just want me to prove that Data is a mere machine. I can'tdo that because I don't believe it. I happen to know better. So I'mneither qualified nor willing. You're going to have to find someoneelse.
[The Measure of a Man]: I'm sorry.
[The Dauphin]: Then you think I'm not sincere?
[Contagion]: I'm not sure, sir. Are we alone out here, Worf?
[The Royale]: We don't have any. If we're going to get out of here, we'regoing to have to do it on our own. I'm going to get some answers out ofthat desk clerk.
[The Icarus Factor]: I'm ready for that briefing whenever you are.
[The Icarus Factor]: No, I. I'm not sure what I'm feeling. What's on your mind?
[The Icarus Factor]: I'm here for the briefing, sir.
[The Icarus Factor]: Yes, I'm sure I will.
[The Icarus Factor]: I'm asking you to leave, or I'll
[The Icarus Factor]: I know. I'm glad you came.
[Pen Pals]: When you figure it out, you'll understand command. I'm on myway. I hope I've been able to help. You let me know what you decide?
[Pen Pals]: I'm sure Mister Data has a very good explanation.
[Pen Pals]: You did a good job. I'm proud of you.
[Up the Long Ladder]: Captain, I'm familiar with most Earth codes, and
[Up the Long Ladder]: I'm having a little debate with the colony's leader. Itseems
[Up the Long Ladder]: I'm sorry, sir. It was either this or arguing till hell frozeover.
[Manhunt]: I'm sorry they startled you, Mrs. Troi. They're Antedeandelegates. They're being stored here temporarily.
[Manhunt]: In a manner of speaking he is. I'm not going to be disturbinghim, I'll just give him the message.
[Peak Performance]: I'm afraid so.
[Peak Performance]: There never are, Lieutenant. I'm going to trust your expertise. Secure your stations. Stand by for my signal.
[Shades of Gray]: Why wouldn't I be comfortable? They're waiting on me hand andfoot. I hope that they don't find out that I'm faking it.
[Shades of Gray]: I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we areexploring the unknown.
[Shades of Gray]: This bug is persistent, I'll admit that. But I'm not worried. WeRikers are ornery, too. As a matter of fact, my great grandfather oncegot bit by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain, the snakedied.
[Shades of Gray]: Then you think I'm not sincere?
[Shades of Gray]: Of course I know who I am. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of theUSS Enterprise.
[The Survivors]: I'm Commander William Riker of the Enterprise. Crewmembers. May I comet down and approach you?
[The Survivors]: I'm not accusing you of anything, Mister Uxbridge. The attackingforce spared you for some reason. We'd like to know why. Now, may I goinside?
[The Survivors]: I'm sorry, but we're finished here. Now, I can allow time foryou and Kevin to pack.
[Who Watches the Watchers]: I'm clear. Energise!
[Booby Trap]: Computers have always impressed me with their ability to takeorders. I'm not nearly as convinces of their ability to creatively givethem.
[The Price]: I hope I'm better than you realise.
[The Vengeance Factor]: I'm not your commander. My name is William.
[The Hunted]: I'm not sure I'd like to live in this place. A little stuffy formy taste.
[The Hunted]: Engineering, I'm getting readings onTactical. Are we back up?
[Déjà Q]: I'm serious.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now.
[A Matter of Perspective]: It's a long story, sir, but I'm sure it doesn't have anything todo with this accident.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Just this. I'm not a murderer. I went to the Tanugan lab as anofficial representative of Starfleet. I actedaccordingly. I was there to evaluate Doctor Apgar's progress in thedevelopment of a Krieger Wave converter. That's all I was interestedin. Computer. Load deposition programme Riker one. Run the simulation.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Doctor Apgar, I'm Commander William Riker. Lieutenant CommanderGeordi La Forge.
[A Matter of Perspective]: I'm sure I'll find everything I need.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now.
[A Matter of Perspective]: I'm Commander William Riker. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Doctor, I'm not trying to put any pressure on you. I'm sure myreport will only underscore the need for continuedsupport of your research.
[A Matter of Perspective]: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now.
[Yesterday's Enterprise]: I'm Commander William Riker. Our emergency teams are on boardyour ship. Doctor?
[Sins of the Father]: I'm sure we'd know. One does not patronise a Klingon warrior.
[Sins of the Father]: The Klingons are very thorough. I'm sure Commander Kurn hasstudied for his assignment just as I did when I served with them.
[Allegiance]: I know, but this is different. He's different. I can't put myfinger on it, but I'm worried.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life veryappealing.
[Captain's Holiday]: I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.
[Tin Man]: I'm not worried about Tin Man. It's more Romulans showing up.
[Hollow Pursuits]: Mister Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report. I don'tknow what you got away with at your last posting, but this is theEnterprise. We set a different standard here. Understood?
[Ménage à Troi]: I'm sick of this game.
[Ménage à Troi]: Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up.
[Ménage à Troi]: What, do you think I'm going to try to escape? What would thatget me? You've already got her. Besides, where would I go?
[Ménage à Troi]: Maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. If I pick a minorsubsystem, something non-essential. Like this. Warp field phaseadjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interferencegenerated by the warp engines.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: If I were, I'm sure you'll be the first to know. Poker's atseventeen hundred hours in my quarters. Deck eight.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: Maybe I'm just afraid of the big chair.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: Maybe that's the problem. I'm too comfortable here.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: I'm sorry if she troubled you, sir. I have already informed her
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]: I'm leading an away team over there to get the Captain back. We'll find a way to bring them out of warp. Ensign Crusher, youcontinue to assist Mister La Forge. Commander Shelby, you'll take theBridge and coordinate with Starfleet. Data, Worf, Doctor, you're withme.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: I'm sure Captain Picard would have something meaningful andinspirational to say right now. To tell you the truth, I wish he werehere, because I'd like to hear it too. I know how difficult thistransition has been for all of you. I can take over for him, but Icould never replace Captain Picard. Nor would I ever try. Whatever theoutcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify hisfaith in all of us. Dismissed.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: I'm not sure anyone can.
[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]: I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it.
[Family]: Continue with the testing, Mister Worf. Here's the finalschedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers. By theway, I'm looking forward to meeting your parents.
[Family]: Well, I'm not sure that I would either, Worf, since this isn't aKlingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, that's yourbusiness, but we don't get to Earth all that often. I'm sure we canarrange for you to have more off duty time while they're here.
[Brothers]: I'm familiar with the game. Go on.
[Suddenly Human]: You're welcome, I'm sure.
[Suddenly Human]: I'm afraid that won't be possible. Last night, Jono attackedCaptain Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody.
[Legacy]: In all trust, there is the possibility of betrayal. I'm not sureyou were prepared for that.
[Future Imperfect]: I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir.
[Future Imperfect]: Sir, I'm not fit to resume command.
[Future Imperfect]: I'm sorry.
[Future Imperfect]: I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long wayto go. A long way.
[Future Imperfect]: I'm not sure it's still in the memory banks,but I used to have a great fishingprogramme on the holodeck.
[Future Imperfect]: I'm not sure I want to remember that.
[Future Imperfect]: Whoa. If we're going to get out of here, you're going to have totrust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you gethere? My name is Will.
[Future Imperfect]: No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore.
[Future Imperfect]: Riker to Picard. I'm here.
[Future Imperfect]: Yes, sir, I'm all right. What aboutRIKER
[Future Imperfect]: I'm not sure yet, sir.
[Future Imperfect]: But I think I'm about to find out. Stand by. What shall I call you? Ethan? Jean-Luc?
[The Loss]: I'm sorry if I
[The Loss]: I'm real.
[The Loss]: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge. I'll check in on you later.
[The Wounded]: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm First Officer William Riker,Counsellor Deanna Troi.
[The Wounded]: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker,First Officer.
[First Contact]: Crusher. Actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her.
[First Contact]: I'm another case for the medical journals, then.
[First Contact]: No, I'm not an alien.
[Qpid]: I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
[The Host]: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losingcontrol.
[The Host]: I'm fine. You look a little tired, Doctor Beverly.
[The Host]: I'm just a little dizzy. I'll be fine. I just need to liedown. PICARD
[The Host]: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication.
[The Mind's Eye]: I'm glad we got you back, Geordi. We're going to need your helpon this.
[In Theory]: That's what I'm hoping you're going to find out.
[In Theory]: I'll do my pre-flight once I'm on board.
[Darmok]: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam andfiring on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm bettingthey're not going to push it that far.
[Darmok]: I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.
[Silicon Avatar]: I think we're going to be all right in here. I'm not sure aboutthe air supply, so stay put, don't move around. Don't expendunnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thingout.
[Silicon Avatar]: With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost peopleon missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with thisthing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we canrisk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family.
[Disaster]: First of all, android or not, I wouldn't ask anyone to take thatkind of risk. Second, if the computer is not working in Engineering,I'm going to need your help to get control of the ship.
[Disaster]: I'm trying. You need a bigger head.
[Unification, Part I]: On screen. I'm Commander William Riker from the FederationStarship Enterprise.
[Unification, Part II]: Who says I'm looking for anybody?
[Unification, Part II]: Okay. I'm looking for you.
[Unification, Part II]: The dead one, I'm afraid.
[Unification, Part II]: I'm on my way.
[Unification, Part II]: Yeah. I'm sure it did.
[Violations]: Not at all. I'm just trying to trace her steps.
[Violations]: Jev, I'm not accusing you of anything. Did she mention feelingill?
[Violations]: She's just trying to eliminate the possibility that one of youmight be carrying an organism that was harmful to Deanna. I'm not implying that you did anything intentional. I'm just trying toget to the bottom of the mystery.
[The Masterpiece Society]: I'm sure she'll feel the same way.
[Conundrum]: I'm reading forty seven of them around the perimeter.
[Conundrum]: I hope I'm not interrupting. RO +
[Conundrum]: Well. I'm glad I ran into the two of you. When you have nomemory of who you are, or who anybody else is, you find yourself RO
[Conundrum]: Well, I'm a little confused.
[Power Play]: Maintain the approach attitude, Data. I'm taking her in. Bracefor impact. RO
[Power Play]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise?
[Power Play]: I'm with you.
[Power Play]: I'm sure as hell not going to beam up whatever might be downthere.
[Ethics]: I'm not a Klingon. I don't think there's any shame in someone being injured.
[Ethics]: I'm sorry.
[Ethics]: No. All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away, so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not going to make it that easy for you.
[Ethics]: That's an excuse. What you really mean is it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife. Watch you stab it into your heart, then pull the knife from your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve. That's the rite of death, isn't it? Well, I'm sorry, Mister Worf. I can't help you. There's only one person on this ship who can.
[The Outcast]: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space.
[The Outcast]: I'm glad to hear it.
[The Outcast]: Getting sensor readings. They're unconscious but they're alive. Stand by. I'm going to transport them over here.
[The Outcast]: If we just sit here, we'll lose all of our systems within anhour, including life support. Okay, I'm rerouting the propulsionsystem to the transporter. Re-channel the navigation systems. Let'stransfer every microjoule of energy we've got. Sensors, life support. This might give us one last shot.
[The Outcast]: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable incrowded rooms.
[The Outcast]: Hello. I'm here to see Soren.
[The Outcast]: I'm just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone.
[The Outcast]: I'm aware of that.
[Cause and Effect]: Your twenty and I'll raise you fifty. You're going to call mybluff, aren't you. I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.
[The Perfect Mate]: Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an empath.
[The Perfect Mate]: I'm beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you werereferring to.
[The Inner Light]: I'm not willing to let this thing keep drilling into him.
[The Inner Light]: I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data,prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord.
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I'm fine. I'm just
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry?
[Time's Arrow, Part I]: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead andjust leave it at that.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and just leave it atthat.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I'm going back for Captain Picard. MisterWorf, assemble an Away team to accompany me to the surface. Doctor, Ineed to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian.
[Time's Arrow, Part II]: I'm going back to the nineteenth century to get the Captain. Doctor?
[Man of the People]: I'm sorry, Ambassador.
[Man of the People]: Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, whydon't you give me a call.
[Man of the People]: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's allthis?
[Man of the People]: You wouldn't have recognised her. Her dress, her hair,everything about her. I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been toanyone, but last night she was someone that I had never seen before.
[Relics]: I'm sorry.
[Relics]: I'm Commander William Riker, starship Enterprise. LieutenantCommander Geordi La Forge.
[Schisms]: Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got?
[Schisms]: I have no problem getting to sleep. Then Ithink I'm sleeping all night. When I wake up, I feel exhausted.
[Schisms]: Two, three days. Do you have to hold that thing that close? I'msorry. I've been on edge all day.
[Schisms]: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start? Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours. I'm having trouble waking up.
[Schisms]: Yes, there is. Give it to me. They've taken me for the last fewnights. If I'm right, the same thing'll happen tonight.
[Schisms]: I'm willing to take that risk.
[Rascals]: I'm in command of this vessel. Who are you and on whoseauthority do you
[Rascals]: You don't really think I'm going to help you.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander
[Chain of Command, Part I]: It's nothing urgent. I'm sorry I bothered you. Good night.
[Chain of Command, Part I]: I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from aCardassian planet near the border.
[Chain of Command, Part II]: I'm not suggesting you trade an entire star system for one man'slife, but you've got to acknowledge that these were Federation ordersand he is a prisoner of war.
[Aquiel]: I checked into her record, too. Her last posting was on DeribenFive. I spoke to her commanding officer there. He said she wasargumentative, quick to take offence. He also told me he transferredher to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts. Tobe honest, I'm having trouble believing her story, sir.
[Aquiel]: Lied, conveniently forgot, I'm not sure. I think it's somethingwe have to consider.
[Aquiel]: This is off the record. I'm saying this as a friend, not yoursuperior officer. I think it would be best if you weren't so personallyinvolved with Aquiel right now. There's a lot about her we don't know.
[Aquiel]: You get Morag. I'm going to the station.
[Starship Mine]: I'm trying to.
[Starship Mine]: You're welcome. I'm not sure which one to feel sorry for.
[Starship Mine]: Mister Worf, I'm surprised at you.
[Lessons]: I'm sorry, the array has already been allocated to Engineering. They're running some warp field tests.
[Lessons]: Fencing? I'm really not very good.
[Lessons]: It's about Lieutenant Commander Daren. As a department head, shecomes to me for systems allocation, personnel transfers, things likethat. I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable with her requests.
[The Chase]: Captain, we've got company. I'm ready to pull you out ofthere.
[Frame of Mind]: I feel terrible. But thanks to you, I'm doing much better now. And I'm confident that when I leave, I will be ready to take my placein society again.
[Frame of Mind]: No, I'm looking forward to proving my innocence.
[Frame of Mind]: You bet I'm agitated. I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'mnot insane. And there isn't any. There isn't. There's nothing. 'm sorry. Could we go back to 'you're becoming agitated'?
[Frame of Mind]: I'm still not comfortable with that final speech.
[Frame of Mind]: Maybe I'm just not right for this part.
[Frame of Mind]: No, I'll check them tomorrow. I'm going to bed early. Theperformance is tomorrow night. I want to be up for it.
[Frame of Mind]: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And nothing you or anyone else can say will change that. And I won't let you or anyone else tell me that I am. You may be ableto destroy my mind, but you can't change the fact that I'm innocent. Ididn't kill that man! And that's what's driving you crazy.
[Frame of Mind]: No matter you can say will the fact that I'm innocent! I'm notcrazy! I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
[Frame of Mind]: I'm Commander. Commander. A second ago I knew who I was. I wason the ship. I was in a play. And now I'm having trouble rememberinganything.
[Frame of Mind]: I'm not that far gone, am I?
[Frame of Mind]: What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up in herefor days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,what to think, what to say.
[Frame of Mind]: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I amnot insane. And there is nothing you
[Frame of Mind]: Nothing you can do will change the fact that I'm innocent. I'mnot crazy. I'm not
[Frame of Mind]: All I know is when I go back to the ship, reality breaks apart. Nothing makes sense. And then when it's over, it fades away like adream. But when I'm in the hospital, everything here seems real and Iremember everything that happens here.
[Frame of Mind]: If I'm right, you're not really here. This isn't a real phaser. It's all a fantasy, and I'm going to end it, no matter what it takes.
[Frame of Mind]: You're right, I won't. But I'm going to find out what's real andwhat's not.
[Frame of Mind]: No. If this is a real phaser, then I was on the Enterprise. ButI fired it on myself, so I should be dead. None of this is real. I'msetting this to level sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half ofthis building. Unless, of course, this isn't a real phaser.
[Frame of Mind]: I'm positive. After everything that I've experienced, I don'tthink I could sleep knowing it was still up. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

[Suspicions]: About everything that's going on. I'm sorry. I'm sure it willall work out.
[Suspicions]: Beverly. I'm saying this to you as a friend.
[Second Chances]: I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation StarshipEnterprise. 2
[Second Chances]: That's not possible. I'm Will Riker.
[Second Chances]: I was the last one out. The distortion field must haveinterfered with the transport. They lost their signal lock on me. WhenI tried to contact the ship, I couldn't get through the interference. If you check with Starfleet I'm sure they will have recorded that I waslost on that day.
[Second Chances]: I'm sorry, I was
[Second Chances]: I'm sure he'll be thrilled to know there are two of us now.
[Second Chances]: I've been able to get by for a long time without seeing him. I'm not about to start now. What made you contact him?
[Second Chances]: Remember, I'm the one who wanted to make Captain by the time Iwas thirty five. I'm a little behind schedule, I'll admit that.
[Second Chances]: If you think I'm coming down on you because the Captainoverruled me, think again. I happen to disagree with his decision, buthe is my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's noconfusion, I am your commanding officer and I expect you to do thesame. If you can't, there's no place for you on my away team. 2
[Second Chances]: That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off theplanet instead of me, don't you think he would have made the samechoices that I made? I just don't want you to be hurt again.
[Second Chances]: Hi. I'm sorry to just stop by like this but there's somethingI'd like to talk to you about. 2
[Second Chances]: Deanna. After I've served for six months, I'm eligible tobring family aboard. If we got married
[Second Chances]: You've been down here dozens of times. I'm sure you know thebest way. 2
[Second Chances]: Hang on! Come on, grab on. Come on! Come on, climb! Come on! I'm being pulled in. 2
[Second Chances]: I guess I'm not surprised to hear that.
[Second Chances]: I'm sorry. 2
[Descent, Part II]: I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. Wewon't cause you any more trouble.
[Liaisons]: You have spend about five minutes greeting the Iyaarans maybe anhour making small talk at this reception. I'm the one who has to escortthem around the ship for the next three days.
[Liaisons]: That is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude. I'msurprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress.
[Interface]: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were
[Interface]: Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere and I'mready to take it onto the ship. If you would like to take a couple ofdays off, I'll run the interface.
[Gambit, Part I]: Great story. I'll remember it next time I'm in a knife fight.
[Gambit, Part I]: I'm all right.
[Gambit, Part I]: That is enough, Counsellor. Deanna. I'm sorry. This is not aboutrevenge. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight fornothing. Somebody has to answer for that. Then I can mourn.
[Gambit, Part I]: I'm going to head for those trees overthere. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire.
[Gambit, Part I]: Looks like you've got a control logic lockout in your regulatorsubsystem. I'm going to attempt to run an activebypass through the plasma flow convertor. You, start runningphase-lock feedback through that regulator. I want about a six seconddelay.
[Gambit, Part I]: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but your outpost is in imminentdanger of attack. I would like to station security personnel on thesurface for your protection. Now, I'm ordering you to drop yourshields.
[Gambit, Part I]: I'm your commanding officer. I'm giving you adirect order. Understood?
[Gambit, Part I]: I've never explained my orders before. I'mnot about to start now.
[Gambit, Part II]: I can't say I'm sorry to hear that.
[Gambit, Part II]: When we reach the Hyralan Sector, we're supposed to rendezvouswith a Klingon transport ship. I'm not sure, but I think they may bedelivering another of the Romulan artefacts to us.
[Gambit, Part II]: You're supposed to verify its authenticity, and then I'msupposed to kill you, and I take your place.
[Gambit, Part II]: I'm sorry. It's been a difficult couple of days. I know that oneof your operatives has been on a mercenary ship investigating thepossible re-assembly of a psionic resonator. I didn't want someone tomake a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet.
[Attached]: Ambassador, I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us withmore information.
[Attached]: A different rendezvous? I'm not sure I know what you mean.
[Attached]: I'm sorry to resort to such drastic measures, Minister, but youleft me little choice.
[Inheritance]: No, but I'm sure Mister Data knows what he's doing.
[Parallels]: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything willreturn to
[Parallels]: I'm looking forward to reading your report.
[The Pegasus]: It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up untilthis moment I had the luxury of time, but now I've got to make achoice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let youstart these experiments again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it iswrong today.
[Lower Decks]: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering EnsignSito.
[Lower Decks]: I'm listening.
[Lower Decks]: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm notconvinced about Lavelle.
[Lower Decks]: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit justbecause I'm unbeatable?
[Thine Own Self]: I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
[Thine Own Self]: I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either.
[Thine Own Self]: No. I'm actually here to tell you that I've decided to cancelthe rest of your test.
[Thine Own Self]: I'm cancelling the test.
[Thine Own Self]: I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to theship. I cannot let any Bridge Officer serve who's not qualified. I'msorry.
[Eye of the Beholder]: I'm not sure yet. Why, are you interested?
[Genesis]: I'm having trouble concentrating myself. It's like my mind keepswandering. I can't
[Firstborn]: I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine. The Duras sisters,Lursa and B'Etor?
[Firstborn]: That's odd. Hail them. I'm Commander William Riker from theFederation Starship Enterprise.
[Firstborn]: Where is this Corvallen now? I'm under orders to acquire somemagnesite.
[All Good Things... Part I]: Oh. I see. I'm sorry. I'll see you in the morning.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm sorry. Be prepared to take command. Aye, sir.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine.
[All Good Things... Part I]: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all Ican do. Riker out.
[All Good Things... Part I]: I cheat. I'm kidding.
