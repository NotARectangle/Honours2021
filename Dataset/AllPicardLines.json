You're right,Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, wecould overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want.", "Which means, of course", "That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, thecustoms here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous,strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago.

Are you searching all frequencies? Any signof any kind of messages?", "Weapons report, Lieutenant.", "Engineering, give me status on power recovery. Engineering,come in. Why aren't they answering? La Forge.", "Get me a full report from Engineering.", "Counsellor?", "It still makes it our move.", "If so, the question becomes how will they use that knowledge? Data, do you have any information touching this on any file?", "What kind of traders?", "Engineering? Join La Forge down below in Engineering, NumberOne.", "Without warp capacity, we're just a floating target.", "I understand the allusion.

I wish I had some clue as to whatthey will do next.", "Yes, Data, that is a natural assumption. Engineering?", "I wonder what they're thinking over there.", "And nothing shameful in a strategic retreat, either.", "Excellent, La Forge. Now let's, er, let's throw them off guard. Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies.", "At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention Ferengistarship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.

A terrifying experiencefor anyintelligent being. As if a great claw had reached down and scooped oneof you from your home world. Drawn into the energy circuits of thisvessel, it found its way to you, Worf. Frantic at being carried fromits home world, and recognising you as sentient beings, it pleaded forhelp, but in ways youcouldn't understand. Desperately going from person to person, and thendiscovering the computer intelligence in this ship's memory circuits. Oh, simplistic intelligence, but it furnished it enough to slow thisEnterprise thing that had captured it.

You were about to say?", "It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can seewhatever is outside this vessel.", "And something else that's circling your world.

My apologies for saying that you babbled.", "You also see things in a way we do not, but as they truly are. I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or any member of thisvessel be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that.", "Exactly. How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws downthere. Not permitting the Crusher boy to be executed. And by so doingdo I endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives?", "I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did youlearn anything about the relationship between that and the Edo? Why arethey so certain it's a god?", "Then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might haveshared our kind of values.", "Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect theEdo?", "You now request permission to beam down to the planet. Permission granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this.

Well, in one hour we shall knowwhy.", "Are you always accustomed to getting your way, Doctor?", "It seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as aheadache.", "So what's the cause of my headache?", "The pain's gone.", "Doctor!", "Ensign, answer the First Officer's question.", "The correct procedure,", "Oh, it's nothing. It's just a, just a mild headache. Thecorrect procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal the Bridge of yourfinding immediately.", "Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over.

What is this all about?", "Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge.", "Why, it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it?", "No. It hit with more impact.", "Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, Iwas remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A manoeuvre wasbeing made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Canyou smell it?", "That was just part of my memory.", "Well, it was strong, whatever it was. Are you ready, NumberOne.", "We were traveling at warp two through the Maxia Zeta starsystem when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired onus, point-blank range.", "It must have been lying in some deep moon crater.

If they comein a second time with our shields damaged", "He's my weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting quitecaught up in this.", "I improvised. With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill, Iordered a sensor bearing, and when it went into the return arc", "And our attacker fired on the wrong one.", "It was a save our skins manoeuvre. We were finished. On fire. We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttlecraft forweeks before we were picked up.

Unfortunately, I fired our main phasersand our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel.", "Thank you, Will.

Whatdo the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them?", "Excellent, Doctor.", "He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memorybegins to fail.", "That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor. Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge forthe next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health forthese negotiations, and he might require your services.", "Admiral, we're approaching the Idini StarCluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit?", "Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us.", "Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily.", "The admiral displayed a remarkableimprovement out there, wouldn't you say?", "Then how do you account for it?", "I want you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly.", "Specifics, Doctor.", "Give me what you have now.", "You said there is no cure for Iverson's.", "Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible.", "Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask the Admiral some questions.", "Admiral, in addition to your rank, you are a particularlyvaluable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers.", "Yes, I've heard of that story. It's a myth.", "Obviously it works very rapidly, but how does it work?", "So you took the whole dose.", "The only question I have, Admiral, is why you thought itnecessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages. Evenwilling to put your life at risk for it. I'll be on the Bridge,Admiral, if you want to talk further.", "One moment, Mister Data. Admiral, this is Picard. May I knowthe reason for this communication?", "You said Karnas was a proud man, Admiral,probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation. Is itwise to press him on this?", "Then I suggest a secured channel, Admiral.", "Make it so.", "Ready for exactly what, Admiral?", "What has happened to bring you to that conclusion? That's quitea big jump.", "Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives?", "Wouldn't that be a little obvious, Admiral?", "Therefore you see this armed raid as the only option.", "With respect, Admiral, I would point out no one else has heardor considered Karnas's demands. The Federation might view themdifferently if they knew what they were.", "I couldn't sleep either.", "Perhaps in this case, rethinking?", "Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk yourlife to lead it personally?", "Noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. You've beenhere before. You negotiated a release of the hostages with Karnasbefore. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid? It's my away teamyou're sending in there. I think there's something you're not tellingme, and I have a right to know what it is.", "That's the official record.", "Are you saying that's not the truth?", "You did what?", "And that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war.", "Karnas could have worked for peace during those years insteadof continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral.", "Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew that you werestill alive.", "Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the Bridge.", "The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I amthe Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise.", "No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five yearsago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers.", "Geordi?", "Reset phasers to stun.", "Take cover!", "Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before.", "Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now!", "Sickbay. Not good is a galactic understatement.", "Karnas, this is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you the Admiral iscritically ill.", "Picard.", "I'm on my way.", "Sickbay.", "What is it, Doctor?", "Picard here.", "It means almost certain death for you, Admiral.", "Number One, inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in less thanfive minutes.", "You have your orders, Number One.", "Karnas, this is Admiral Mark Jameson.", "Doctor!", "He is the Admiral, Karnas. Before he left on this mission, headministered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. Hewanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what thedrug has done to him.", "As I understand it, Karnas, you were the one who demanded theweapons to avenge your father's death.", "Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beamdown. Karnas, I asked Doctor Crusher to bring with her the visualrecords we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look atthem?", "Just a few moments. You saw the Admiral on the Enterprise whenhe was en route to Mordan?", "And you recognised him?", "Is this the man you saw?", "He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound there was noway to stop it.", "You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted fromJameson isn't possible any more. And you wanted revenge. You blamedyour war on him, and there's no doubt he had a lot to do with it. Butyou had the weapons and you used them. You could have tried fornegotiations for peace on your planet long ago. Instead you chose tofight. How many of those forty years of civil war are on your head,Karnas?", "Forty five years ago he made the wrong decision. He wanted tocome here to somehow right it, to atone for what he did. Now all he cando is to give himself up to you. He brought this retribution onhimself.", "Can you ease the pain?", "The hostages have been freed by Karnas,unharmed, and the body of Admiral Mark Jameson has been buried onMordan, at the request of his widow and by the permission of Karnas. The quest for youth, Number One. So futile. Age and wisdom have theirgraces too.", "I hope not, Number One. Mister La Forge, prepare to take us outof orbit. Set course for Isis Three.", "Commander Riker, report to the Bridge.", "Number One.", "No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've beentracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It'slike following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here andstopped, which is what I knew would interest you.", "From where?", "All stop, and hold this position.", "Anything?", "On screen.", "Shields and deflectors up.", "A cloaking device?", "We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailingfrequencies, Lieutenant Yar.", "I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. We come inpeace.", "We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I neverbelieved they could be true.", "That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do youreveal yourselves to us now?", "We're ready anytime.", "It was a little sudden.", "Welcome aboard.", "Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through theregular transporting procedure.", "That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team.", "Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and thensuddenly to be here, right in front of us.", "Counsellor, do you sense anything?", "Interesting choices.", "Data, what do you read?", "Don't touch him!", "Shields up. La Forge, contact Commander Riker. Worf, check alldecks.", "All decks? Everything? The entire ship?", "Wesley, are you all right?", "And that's what they have. Status.", "Keep trying. Counsellor, you'll have to gather the parents.", "Harm has already come to them.", "Compensation? You have stolen our children away from theirclassrooms, away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation? You claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed anact of utter barbarity!", "The Aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation.", "That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involvedin the negotiations as your representative.", "I won't insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy. But I can tell you that the Enterprise will not leave them behind. Youcan be assured of that.", "I'll do my best to arrange that.", "Any response from Aldea, Lieutenant?", "You're saying there are holes in their defence system?", "Can we beam down an away team through one of those holes?", "Can you do that?", "Keep trying. While he's doing that, Number One, I want you andLa Forge to try and find some way of getting through one of thoseholes, because one way or the other we have got to get an away team onthe planet, locate the power source for the shield and neutralise it.", "Oh, they'll negotiate, or they'll call it that. They've takenwhat they want. Now they'll rationalise it by throwing us some sort ofbone.", "The minute they believe that we won't accept their compensationfor the children, they'll break off the discussion, they'll disappearbehind their shield, locking us out and the children in forever. That'swhy I've got to keep them talking.", "Doctor Crusher and I are ready, Radue.", "No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff Officer, Radue. StarfleetRegulation six point five seven requires that at least two StaffOfficers are present during any treaty or contract negotiations.", "No, Data. Neither am I.", "Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. Now, we'll seewhat they have in mind.", "Before we begin, we want to see thechildren.", "We do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve yourconscience by offering goods in exchange for our children.", "You are trifling with the primal instincts of our species. Imust warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for theirchildren.", "We sympathise with your situation. Surely there is a solutionwhich can be mutually satisfactory?", "A significant beginning. But first, I must ask that DoctorCrusher be allowed to see her son before we continue.", "What was that?", "Position report.", "Geordi, get us back to Aldea. Warp nine.", "Captain's log, supplemental. It has beenthree days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contactwith Radue since then.", "Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar.", "Radue, this is Picard.", "That there is room for discussion, Radue.", "Data, find a way to defeat that shield.", "Things are only impossible until they're not.", "And is that why they can't conceive?", "An entire civilisation that's terminally ill. Is it reversible?", "Good work, Doctor.", "Is there anything I can do?", "Is that what made the Aldeans sterile?", "Is it reversible?", "How long?", "Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole?", "All right. You and Data beam down. Locate the power source ofthat shield. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans until you're ready.", "Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations.", "Strike? I'll see what I can do.", "It's not over yet, Wesley.", "Good, Wesley. Now", "Yes, Harry.", "You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much Iadmire his son. Hello, Alexandra.", "They want to go home.", "Number One.", "Hold for orders.", "The shield that protected your world in one way is weakening itin another. It is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you.", "That's it, exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you socompletely you've lost even the desire to even question it.", "Commander Riker.", "I assume you have control of the computer.", "Good. Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam thechildren up.", "Enterprise, hold.", "All right, Harry?", "We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you.", "A legacy of your Progenitors, Radue. The source of your powerand of your problems.", "Will you let us help you?", "Are you finished?", "The legend will die, but the people will live.", "Wesley!", "Mister La Forge, out of orbit. Warp five.", "It takes very special people to live in such desolation.", "Lieutenant Yar, hailing frequencies.", "Velara Three base, this is Captain Picard of the starshipEnterprise.", "Velara Three base, this is the Enterprise. Come in please. Over.", "Velara Three base, do you copy?", "Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were gettingalong.", "Your staff is all well, I presume, Director?", "If there anything we can do to help? You and your staff arewelcome aboard for a change of scene, rest.", "Of what?", "Director Mandl, we've heard of your remarkableachievements in terraforming. My crew would very much appreciatelooking around.", "We would require no special attention.", "Well, whether he wants us or not. DirectorMandl, unless you're absolutely refusing permission for us to land atyour station, prepare to receive our away team.", "Counsellor, perhaps you'd better go along as well.", "Someone that tense could be very unpredictable. Stay on yourtoes, Number One.", "Situation report, Number One.", "Keep me informed.", "Be specific.", "Get him out of there!", "Away team, now. What is happening?", "I'm going to beam him out of there.", "None at all, Mister Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I'veprovided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Perhaps you'd liketo make use of them.", "Mister Mandl, an attack on one of my crew gives me the right.", "Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactoryexplanation of this. Director Mandl. Lieutenant Yar, would you escortthe Director to his quarters.", "Go on with your report.", "Certainty? Or speculation?", "And so the question becomes not who, since it clearly was oneof the three remaining terraformers. The question becomes why? What arethey hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them, couldbe desperate enough to kill?", "Not yet.", "Malencon?", "Good. Data, I want you and Geordi to return for more carefulinspection.", "Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage, whatever. Theanswer's there, on the planet. Tasha, I want you to provide CounsellorTroi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests. Psychprofiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent, thepsychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another.", "It seems we are becoming detectives, Number One.", "Would any of those apply here?", "Well, Doctor, you're charging unknown seas. How do we proceed?", "What are we looking at?", "What's that hum?", "Everyone stand back.", "Yes, we're causing it. Why?", "Understandable, given this particular life form's novel nature.", "Doctor Crusher is still making her determination. Mister Mandl,you know the Prime Directive.", "That's what I have to find out. You're a man obsessed with whatyou do. Who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going? Kill,perhaps?", "What do you think, Counsellor?", "What about his file, Lieutenant Yar? Could he have accomplishedthe reprogramming that Data says took place?", "What about the others? Including the victim.", "What is it?", "The hum has gone too. Why?", "Scanning us? Why? What could it hope to learn?", "I don't see anything.", "Translation? From whom?", "Bridge, this is the Captain. Request emergency power toinitiate lab quarantine seal.", "We have confirmed that Data's discovery islife. But more than that, it is intelligent life.", "It's trying to communicate with us. Captain's log, supplemental. The inorganic lifeform from Velara Three has apparently taken over our Medical Lab.", "Mister La Forge, can we see into the lab yet?", "Doctor?", "Continue quarantine.", "Counsellor, I shall need you. You have the Bridge, Number One.", "Director Mandl, I put it to you again. Whatdo you know about these life forms?", "Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive andit must stop. You have kept information from me since our firstcommunication. An alien life form has taken possession of my MedicalLab. You knew of its existence.", "It is a life form and it has intelligence.", "It's trying to communicate with us.", "When did you first become aware of them?", "Oh, yes. Do tell us.", "What did you think it was?", "All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began tounderstand that there was something that was different about them.", "Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell meabout these patterns.", "Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting tocommunicate?", "Bensen?", "Patch visual to Observation lounge.", "We see it too, Number One.", "Get that seal back up.", "Bags of mostly water?", "We didn't hear you. We come in peace.", "Can you hear us now? Mister La Forge?", "More is stronger. Captain's log, supplemental. We have regainedvisual contact with the lab, but our attempts to restore communicationwith this microbrain, as we have come to call it, has beenunsuccessful. One thing that is certain, however. This life form hasdeclared war on us.", "Data, any analysis of those bolts of light it emits?", "Have we disabled the Medical Lab computer console?", "Medical Lab on main viewer. Let's use this calm.", "Tasha, set coordinates to beam it back where it came from.", "Energise.", "Life form or not, intelligent or not , the safety of this shipand everyone aboard her is my primary responsibility. Data, evacuateall the air from the Medical Lab. I want a vacuum there.", "It has declared a state of war and we are on the defensive. Wehave no control over our Medical Lab nor our computer. At this momentit has the power to destroy this ship and everybody on it. I need yourhelp.", "It said you killed some of them. I need to know how.", "What was Malencon doing when he was killed?", "Reason enough for anyone to go to war.", "What can you determine, Mister La Forge?", "Then what is feeding the damn thing?", "Meaning?", "Kill the lights in the medical lab, Mister La Forge. Let's seeif darkness will neutralise it.", "Number One, light.", "Only if you will talk to us.", "We have no wish to kill you. We never have.", "We will end this war, if you will end the war.", "Agreed. We will send you home to your wet sand. Picard toRiker. Bring up the lights in the lab, just a bit. Are youbetter?", "We mean you no harm. Do you believe me?", "Good. It is important that you trust us.", "We understand what you are saying. We will leave you. We willsend you home.", "In time, Mister Data. When we're better prepared.", "And respects. Lieutenant Yar.", "Energise. Captain's log, stardate 41464.8. I have declared anindefinite quarantine for Velara Three, and we are now returning toStarbase with the three surviving terraformers.

But say if it were undone, would she be normalagain?", "You said that the transporter could be modified to filter outthe changes in Doctor Pulaski?", "Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a bloodtest taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that be used tofilter out the genetic changes?", "Data.", "Can you do the modifications?", "Then make it so.", "Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise.", "Doctor, we may have a solution.

We too are machines,just machines of a different type. Commander Rikerhas also reminded us that Lieutenant Commander Data was created by ahuman. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant.

What is required forsentience?", "Prove to the court that I am sentient.", "So I am sentient, but Data is not?", "Why? Why am I sentient?", "Ah, that's the second of your criteria. Let's deal with thefirst, intelligence. Is Commander Data intelligent?", "Like this hearing.", "What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I selfaware?", "Commander Data, what are you doing now?", "And what's at stake?", "My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seemsreasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting.", "Do you like Commander Data?", "But you admire him?", "Engineering and programming. Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics ingeneral?", "And Commander Data in particular?", "And now you propose to dismantle him.", "How many more?", "A single Data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity. Awonder, even. But thousands of Datas. Isn't that becoming a race? Andwon't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now, tell me, Commander,what is Data?", "What is he?", "Is he? Are you sure?", "You see, he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, sowhat if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? Do you? Do you? Well, that's the question you have to answer. Your Honour, thecourtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we areleft with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later,this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regardthis creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people weare, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroomand this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries ofpersonal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagelycurtailing them for others.

Well, what is it, Wesley?", "China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelledthere. No, the Iconians were certainly real. Sit down.

That was very foolish.", "No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risklosing you.", "Is this how the Iconians travelled? Crossing light years aseasily as we would cross a room? Those places could be on worlds indistant sectors of the galaxy. I think the Iconians might haveout-foxed their enemies. Maybe they didn't all die in the bombardment. Some of them could have passed through this. This is what Varleyfeared. This is what he died for.", "The Romulans could use this technology as a weapon.", "We can't make that assumption. The effect on the Yamato wasdevastating, but what if it was by accident, not by design. What I'mgoing to say may sound unscientific, but standing on this soil,breathing in this air, my instincts tell me that we may have got themwrong.", "But that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of thosewho attacked this world. The victors invariably write the history totheir own advantage. There is an unfortunate tendency in many culturesto fear what they do not understand.

Maybe help him.", "This will be the test.", "Destroy the tricorder.", "And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. How long?", "I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. Data, I have todestroy this. This control room and its technology must not be allowedto fall into Romulan hands.", "How! How do I do it? How do I destroy everything? The controlroom, the probes, all of it.", "I detonate it. But how? How do I do that?", "Probes? The probes. Launch? I launch the probes? But why? What's good will that do?", "Doors?", "And if the doors are closed, then the backwash from the rocketswill spill into the power grids and there'll be an overload.", "But the doors will open automatically when the launch begins. And I will override.", "Which control keys? Damn. Of course, you can't see.", "Worf, help him up.", "I'm standing directly in front of the gate. To my left there isa small triangular screen.", "Right. Now, to my right is a larger triangular screen. The topis solid amber. To the left, red.", "That's the launch sequence? How do I override the doors?", "I hope that's not a stutter. I don't know how long a delaythere will be between the launch and the detonation. I'll hold keyingthe launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until theEnterprise reappears?", "I'll go through the gate.", "Very shortly, anywhere will be preferable to this room. MisterWorf, I am depending on you. You must get Data back to the Enterprise. He may be their only hope.", "Oh, no.", "Not, I think, today, Commander.", "Bridge, Picard.", "Take us out of here.

To do so violates the very essence of thePrime Directive.", "Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rationalthese people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in thesupernatural. Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, tosend them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance andfear? No!

We have good reason tomistrust one another, but we have better reasons to set our differencesaside. Now, of course, the question is, who will take the initiative? Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I mustlower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface. Oncethe shields are down, you will of course have the opportunity to fireon us.

Don'tyou?", "Oh yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratorymaze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how wellwe react under pressure.", "It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do havesomething in common. We all react differently to authority. You, thecollaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, rejectauthority in any form. I, a Starfleet Captain, trained to command. Andyou, a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority. Our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us toovercome.

And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses to set usagainst each other again, while you observe our reactions.", "I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of theEnterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you.

How are you?", "But not today.", "If time is so important, why didn't they transmit the orders bysubspace?", "What sort of passenger?", "Mister Data, come with me.", "You know him?", "Oh, I see.

How?", "Romulans.", "They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren islocated.", "Then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own toinvestigate this Tin Man.", "Then, it's a race?

We cannot allow them", "Damage report!", "It seems you woke your Tin Man.", "Good. Because I want to know exactly what you did. I want toknow how closely you are in communication with the alien, and whatyou've learned about it, and I want to know now.", "Where did it come from? How many", "Once?", "Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to returnwith us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinityof Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes?", "No. That is absolutely out of the question.", "No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached outto the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? Tothe danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct?", "Data, you seem to have developed anaffinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can hebe trusted?", "Yes, of course. But his judgment", "Afraid of what?", "Thank you both.", "Data?", "Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man.

In fact I recall Captain Gleasonspeaking quite highly of him before his transfer.", "And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the samecommitment to Starfleet that we all have.

We'll want alltransporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic acrossthe board.", "Report.", "Maintain that. What the hell happened?", "Picard to La Forge.", "Commander, any explanation for this injector problem?", "Another malfunction?", "Yes, I should say you should, Commander. Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander.", "It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay", "On this latest incident.", "Go ahead, Commander.", "Take us out of warp.", "Red alert.", "Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergencysaucer separation.", "The question is, will the injectors come back online?", "Make it so.", "Transfer injector control to manual.", "Cycle power through ventral relay.", "Stand down from red alert.", "Understood.

We're running a full analysis.", "No.", "Mister Fajo, I would like to analyse your sensor readings ofthe explosion.", "Perhaps, but I don't want to leave any avenue unexplored.", "How much hytritium did we manage to bring on board?", "Mister Fajo, I realise we have acquired your complete supply ofhytritium. Do you know where we could obtain some more?", "Mister Fajo, thank you for your help.", "Mister Crusher, set a course for the Beta Agni Two system, warpsix.", "Thank you, Number One.", "Engage.", "I know it's hard to accept, but even the best", "What are you suggesting, Lieutenant?", "I'm sure you have done a complete investigation, and if youwish to continue it, of course you have my support. But we shall bereaching the Beta Agni system shortly, and I expect you to be rested.", "Dismissed. Geordi, I understand how much we want, even need, toexplain an accident like this. Sometimes there just aren't anyexplanations.", "We must select an officer to replace Data at Ops. Recommendations?", "Mine as well. Make it so.", "He was a man, taken for all in all. I shall not look upon his likeagain.", "Go ahead, Commander.", "Mister Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mister Data, scan. Myapologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water.", "Any indication of the source?", "Launch probe.", "Specify.", "Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two.", "Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down andhave a closer look.", "You're suggesting he created the problem just to solve it?", "Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo.", "Computer, that is sufficient.", "Mister Crusher.", "Set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion. Warpeight.", "He's a trader. He doesn't attract customers by being hard tofind.", "Make it so.", "Mister Crusher, new coordinates. Lay in a course for Lya Four.", "I met him once, many years ago, very briefly at his son'swedding. I can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant,standing in the presence of such history. I remember he spoke to me andI just stood there grinning like an idiot.", "Indeed. How do you make small talk with someone who shaped theFederation?", "Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievementfor his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans areincalculable.", "Has the ambassador been delayed?", "Please go ahead.", "I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart.", "You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbedduring the voyage.", "Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek.", "Your service honours us.", "Mrs. Sarek.", "This is my first officer, Commander William Riker.", "No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are", "I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before theconference begins.", "I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old. But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they?", "Well, we'll respect Mister Mendrossen's request and allowAmbassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, myexpectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, memories, his uniqueunderstanding of the history he's made.", "No, the concert will ahead as scheduled. But it's a pity thatthe guest of honour will be absent.", "That's an excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the Bridge,Number One.", "I hope I'm not intruding.", "Actually, I came to see you.", "I find that hard to believe. Thank you.", "The honour is ours.", "My word! High praise from a Vulcan.", "Logical.", "I came to invite you, and your husband if he is available, to aMozart recital this evening.", "Well, then I hope to see you tonight.", "I noticed that Lieutenant Worf put Ensign D'Amato on report forinsubordination.", "Indeed he has. Would you look into it, Number One.", "Good evening.", "I assume the work is progressing on the conference room?", "Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew,welcome.", "Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening.", "At your convenience, Mister Data. Please.", "Are you suggesting this is somehow contagious?", "This is a hell of a time. Whatever it is, I don't want it toaffect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest ofthe crew until we've identified the cause.", "Sarek?", "He cried. I saw that. I couldn't believe it. A Vulcan moved totears by music? It's", "What would cause such a loss of control?", "I can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the very core oftheir being. How would this affect others on board the ship?", "And when the Legarans beam on board?", "Is there a treatment?", "Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They willaccept no one else. How can we confirm your diagnosis?", "I have twelve hours.", "Nevertheless, we appear to be facing", "Mister Mendrossen", "I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have notbeen affected either. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity,apparently, has no bearing on the phenomenon.", "Mister Data, will you please report to my Ready room.", "It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology and wefind ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age. The loss ofdignity, the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master. Doyou still want to be one of us, Data?", "Logic fails us sometimes, Data. I think this is one of thosetimes. I can only guess that he does not see, or he does not wish tosee, the truth. And he is being insulated against that truth by thosewho love him most.", "Not a task that I'm looking forward to.", "What would you have me do? March down there and destroy theman?", "I know that!", "Don't you tell me what to do!", "Of course. You're right, Number One. It's a task that I willattend to.", "He is very ill, Perrin.", "There's one now. Sakkath knows.", "He knows. And more than that. On this mission he has beenconsciously holding Sarek's mind together as well as he could.", "I must see Sarek.", "I'm sorry.", "The loss is mine, Ambassador.", "Unfortunately the results would not be available for severaldays, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference.", "Then why must Sakkath help to contain your emotions?", "I hope I've not embarrassed you, Ambassador.", "I think you are affected, sir, far more than you realise.", "There is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard theEnterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening.", "Yes. My Chief Medical Officer has explored all other probablecauses.", "That is correct.", "She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortlyafter your arrival.", "Is it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff arecarefully isolating you?", "Surely Sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion?", "But you needed his help at the concert. Or is there possiblysome other logical explanation for what happened that night?", "I saw you crying.", "I was there I saw the tears.", "So you were emotionally affected by the music.", "You still haven't answered my question, Sarek. Is it logicalfor a Vulcan to cry?", "No other logical solutions? But Ambassador, there are alwaysother solutions. You have said so yourself many times.", "Sarek of Vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight atsomething he did not want to see.", "Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth.", "Do I hear anger in your voice?", "No. I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. Itis vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling thesenegotiations.", "But at what cost, Number One?", "Come. Perrin?", "How is the Ambassador?", "You know that is impossible.", "He'll never lose that respect.", "Believe me, it would give me great pleasure, but there isnothing I can do.", "Yes, I do, Ambassador. But I also realise the potentialbenefits.", "Which, for a few hours, should provide the emotional controlyou need. In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude thetreaty.", "I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only logical solution.", "I didn't expect that you would, Beverly.", "I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation. Your company is much appreciated.", "Come.", "Doctor Crusher will monitor our responses.", "No! It is wrong. It is wrong! A lifetime of discipline washedaway, and in its place bedlam. Bedlam! I am so old. There is nothingleft but dry bones and dead friends. Tired, oh so tired.", "No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? Iam betrayed by desires. I want to feel. I want to feel everything. ButI am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control.", "Perrin. Amanda. I wanted to give you so much more. I wanted toshow you such tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock, Amanda, didyou know? Perrin, can you know how much I love you? I do love you!", "Beverly.", "It's quite difficult. The anguish of the man, the despairpouring out of him, all those feelings, the regrets. I can't stop them.", "I can't stop them. I can't. I can't.", "I hope your journey aboard the Merrimacwill be uneventful.", "He loves you very much.", "I hope you are wrong, Ambassador.", "I believe I have the best part of that bargain, Ambassador. Peace and long life.", "A toast to the success of the trade conference, Reittan. I mustadmit, I had some doubts when you invited the Ferengi.", "Thank you, Mister Data. It was thoughtful of you to inviteLwaxana Troi to be part of the Betazed delegation.", "I'm sure Counsellor Troi appreciates the opportunity to spendtime with her mother.", "Perhaps later, Lwaxana. Mister Data and I were just about toshow Reittan Grax the er, the er, the new door mechanisms on the aftturbolifts. If you'll excuse us?", "Indeed. Fine work. We shall miss you, Mister Crusher. As you'veguessed, final entrance examination scores from Starfleet Academy havearrived. Congratulations. As soon as you have completed the oral exam,you'll be formally admitted.", "That'll be all. Number One, a moment.", "You'll agree that this is a fairly routine mapping mission?", "Counsellor Troi had the good sense to ask for shore leave. Ican see I'm going to have to suggest it to you. Have a good time,Number One.", "It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy beingexpended.", "Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, Data, but that takes away none of thewonder.", "Good. Contact Commander Riker on Betazed.", "On screen.", "Our communications have been blocked by the nebula, Reittan. Isthere a problem?", "Now we now have a reasonable hypothesis asto whom.", "Commander Riker will assume that we'll be searching for them. He'll find some way to send us a message. Mister Worf, I want continualmonitoring of Ferengi subspacefrequencies. Mister La Forge, can you extend our sensor range?", "Make it so.", "Not until we have someplace to go.", "Can you locate the Krayton?", "Gentlemen, I have the utmost confidence in your ability toperform the impossible.", "Mister Crusher. Now. No lengthy farewells. Good luck.", "Wesley.\u00a0WESLEY", "Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss theBradbury.", "Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengitransmissions.", "Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. Heselected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss asstatic.", "Plot an intercept course.", "Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp eight.", "Engage.", "Are you both all right?", "Hail the Krayton.", "On screen.", "Of course you were, DaiMon. But you're still holding LwaxanaTroi.", "Er, er. It's not over between us, Lwaxana. You're mine and Iwill not let you go. I insist you return to my side immediately.", "My love is a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseththe disease.", "In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee athousand errors see. But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,who in despite of view are please'd to dote. Shall I compare the to asummer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.", "Listen, Tog, I must possesses Lwaxana. And if that meansdestroying your ship in the process, so be it.", "That can be arranged. Mister Worf, arm phaserbanks and photon torpedoes. If Lwaxana Troi is not in my arms in tenseconds, throw everything you've got at the Krayton.", "When I have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growthagain. It needs must wither. Nine, eight.

The Enterprisewill continue to benefit from your talents for another year.", "No.", "I'm just thinking that I'm saying goodbye to you as you aretoday.", "The Academy must make you wait, that's true. But, when I reviewyour service to this ship, your crewmates, I cannot in all consciencemake you wait for the Academy. You see, Wesley, in my eyes you're anacting ensign in title only.

It was mine. When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had tobe done. We knew that if only we could persuade him to make thedecision to stay, then you would most likely let him. So with the bestof intentions, we tried to convince him, and in so doing, we thoroughlyfailed to listen to his feelings, to his needs. That was the crime, andit has taken a huge toll on a strong and very noble young man. And itmust be rectified. He will return home. To the only home he's everknown. And to the father that he loves.

I'm sure you are aware of the procedureinvolving passengers.", "I was not informed either.", "Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me.", "Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time?", "Perhaps it would be prudent to find out if he'd acquired anyenemies there.", "Thank you, Number One.

I want some answers.", "I've read your reports.", "Are you suggesting that a bubble could have made Doctor Quaicedisappear?", "Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment?", "And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering?", "Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others?", "I doubt the warp bubble could alter computer records, or erasememories.

Well done.", "Ishara, I wanted to thank you personally for what you did forus down on the colony. It was more than I expected.", "Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw TashaYar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach awounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as hadmine. When it was all over, I requested that she be assigned to theEnterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour.

I think you would have been proud of her. And sheof you.", "Good.

It would put the Federation in a very difficultposition.", "That doesn't suggest a Romulan connection?", "We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to beuntrustworthy.", "No. Mister Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that couldbe a direct threat to the security of the Federation.", "As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the nexttransition proceeding.", "Yes, it will.", "Both your claims have been properly made and recorded.

Until now.", "The High Council would seem to agree. They consider the matterclosed. I don't. Mister Worf, the Enterprise crew currently includesrepresentatives from thirteen planets.

Iunderstand your loss, We all admired K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will appearon your record. Dismissed. Mister Worf, isn't it time for the truthabout your father's innocence to be told?

It's almost beyondbelief.", "And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. A few more daysof relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed.", "Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which is four years ago. ARomulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coilshad collapsed, life support was failing.", "The Romulans were impressed, to say the least. After years ofdistrust and conflict, they started to talk.

Please don'tmake a liar out of me.", "Well, for your final mission aboard the Enterprise you willaccompany me to Pentarus Five while I try to sort out the problems withthe miners.

What kind?", "Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturallyoccurring?", "A life form?", "Well, we can't go back and we can't stay here. We've got tokeep going for the mountains. No matter what is waiting there.", "Not necessarily. This could be created by volcanic activity. Lava flows.

This is more valuable tous as a coolant or disinfectant.", "Mister Crusher, stow that with the medical supplies. Keep youreye on it. All right, we're going to explore the cave.

I just need to get my breath.", "Mister Dirgo, I would appreciate it if you didn't bury mebefore I'm gone.", "The trouble is, he could be right.", "Wesley, you are going to have to keep a rein on Dirgo. He'swilful and stubborn. That's dangerous.", "Wesley, listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. Myvision is blurred. I'm going to get worse, not better. I'm not going tobe able to help you.

Number One, will you and the Counsellor meet our guestsin Transporter room three? And inform Chief O'Brien I will be callingon him.", "Of course you are concerned, Gul Macet.

And if he could not find a role for himself inpeace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him.", "One more thing, Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships were notcarrying scientific equipment, were they? A research station withinarm's reach of three Federation sectors?

A wise man once said, there is a sucker bornevery minute.", "I've been examining the dynamics of what used to be called thecon game. Quite fascinating. Worthy of your study, Data.", "Yes, I do, Data. And I believe it is our job to out-con the conartist.", "We can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousandyears ago. Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his societyat hand and he conceived this Contract of Ardra to motivate change. Ormaybe there was an Ardra of some sort who is the basis of thismythology. Who knows? The point is that somehow a fundamental theologywas created which transformed this society, but in the process ofchange, created this latent fear which has been passed down throughgenerations. Data, from your own experience of performing EbenezerScrooge, you're aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator.", "And in the hands of a con artist, fear can be used to motivateobedience, capitulation, the exploitation of innocent people. And thatis what I believe has happened here. I intend to prove that.

You'll make a fine judge.", "Objection. There is no conclusive evidence that this woman evervisited the planet a thousand years ago.", "That would be acceptable.", "But, your honour!", "Objection!", "Your Honour, nothing in this testament proves that Ardra hadthe power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians.

Did Ardra simply snap herfingers and transform the planet into this paradise?", "Did she personally form the government that so peacefully ruledthis planet for a millennium?", "I see. So she advised this council?", "No? Then she must have destroyed all the weapons on the planet.", "Well then, let's move on to the environmental gains on VentaxTwo. How were those accomplished", "But Ardra must have purified the polluted water and air?", "Did she not even pick up one piece of trash?", "Forgive me, but it sounds as if with a great deal of hard workand courage, your ancestors changed this world all by themselves.", "No further questions.", "I believe my associate, Mister La Forge, may be bringing theanswer to that question. I request a recess.", "Mister La Forge, my reputation as a litigator, not to mentionmy immortal soul, is in serious jeopardy.", "Have you identified the source of her power?", "She has a Romulan cloaking device?", "The Enterprise?", "Can you make contact?", "This is what I want to do, but we have less than an hour.", "Jared, you're a wise and experienced leader, and I assume youtrust your senses?", "And all your senses tell you that this woman here is the mostpowerful force on this planet, don't they?", "Then what would you say if I were to tell you that she has nopowers whatsoever?", "Oh, yes. Ardra's magic. Jared, would you believe me if I toldyou that I could steal her powers and perform the same magical acts asshe?", "No, that's true. I'm not Ardra. but I can create tremors justas she did.", "Of course. Ardra, will you would do the honours and stop thetremors?", "Is something the matter?", "Well, I don't.", "You Recognise the old bag of tricks? What about this one? Come back, Ardra, if you can. No? Fine, allow me", "Impudence?", "Your Honour, I appreciate your indulgence. Allow me to explain. A team from the Enterprise has taken control of this woman's ship nowin orbit around Ventax Two. Thank you for your help, Number One.", "They have been monitoring me on my communicator, executing aprearrangedprogramme on her ship's computer, a fairlyingenious combination of force-field projection, holography andtransporter effects. Ardra controls her magic literally bythe blink of an eye. Centuries old technology. An implant which permitsthe movements of her eye to choose and activate each illusion. Ardra once told us that she is known by many names. Well, at least inthat she was being honest. Her crew has admitted that she is known bytwenty three aliases in this sector alone.", "Deceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years.

She knows nothing about this, Johnny.", "Don't listen to him, Gloria. He's lying.", "It's a mystery. Who was this man? Who killed him? Where's themoney he was talking about? It's a mystery.

Damn it, Icouldn't get the license plate.", "It's all right, Madeline, I'll take it in here.", "Yes, what is it?", "I appreciate your concern, Commander Data. What can I do foryou?", "Well, there's nothing unusual about that.", "That is unusual.", "Well, thank you, Mister Data. Procedures require that weinvestigate. Recall the bridge crew and set in a course.", "I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a twenty-fourth century mysteryI have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like.", "A wormhole?", "Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course", "Data.", "Apparently so. How long were we unconscious?", "You were not affected?", "Thank you, Mister Data. Well, where the hell are we?", "Proceed.", "Go ahead, Doctor.", "The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole.", "Apparently we were all unconscious forabout thirty seconds.", "There's little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor.", "Ship's status?", "Counsellor? Are you all right?", "Well, not too bad, all things considered.", "There's still the anomalous M-class planet we were going toinvestigate. Do we go back?", "Make it so.", "Readings, Data?", "On screen.", "Mister Data, run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormholedidn't permanently damage the sensors.", "Ensign, take us back on a course", "Problem, Number One?", "No, no, we don't have time for that. We've encountered a minormystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Number One,unless there's a major objection, then Ensign McKnight should put usback on course for Evadne Four.", "Ensign.", "Come.", "A minor mystery?. That seems to be a recurring phrase thesedays. Oh, Diomedian scarlet moss. I didn't know you were anenthnobotanist.", "You've got a good crop here. As I recall, it's not easy tocultivate.", "Correct.", "Perhaps you've got some sort of fast growth strain.", "Doctor, we were not unconscious for a full day. Everything onboard indicates that we were out for thirty seconds. The ship'schronometer, the computer, everything, Doctor, including CommanderData.", "Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis. Well, perhaps we'vegot a tempest in a test tube, after all.", "Data, I promised Mister Nelson that you would assist him withthe sensor diagnostic. You'll find him hard at work on deck thirty six.", "Do you believe him? I want a frank answer, Commander.", "I'm not sure, Mister Worf. I have never known Data to tell alie, and yet.", "It could be that whatever caused this situation also affectedData. And it could be that he's telling the truth and that this is alljust a minor mystery.", "Doctor, Commander, make it so. Meanwhile, we will maintain ourpresent course. If there is something wrong with Data, wedon't want him to be aware of our suspicions.", "What is it, Doctor?", "I'm on my way to Engineering. Join me.", "The internal clock.", "And were they?", "If that's the good news, what's the bad news?", "That is an understatement, Data. Is it possible that someone orsomething could have affected you without your knowing?", "Data, would you consent to being examined by Commander LaForge?", "Will you escort Commander Data to Engineering?", "And?", "I was almost hoping that you'd find a problem.", "This entire mystery started when our sensors detected thatplanet. First it was class-M, now it isn't.", "Data launched that probe.", "What happened to us in that missing day? Surely there must besome clues. Each of us should try and think what we were doing justbefore we blacked out. Reenact it if you have to.", "Deanna, are you all right?", "Perhaps Sickbay would be a better idea.", "Will you see the Counsellor to her quarters?", "Is she all right?", "What happened, Deanna?", "Go ahead, Geordi.", "I'm on my way.", "Do you recognize this planet, Data?", "Strange, that an obscure planet several hundred light yearsfrom here should be picked up by the probe. Data, did you take thisimage from the ship's library and programme the probe to send it backto us?", "But you don't deny it.", "Mister La Forge, will you send another probe to the T-taurisystem?", "Counsellor Troi just had a very disturbing hallucination.", "For the moment. Can you tell me if Deanna's incident is relatedin any way to this missing time period?", "Data, you're the key to this entire mystery and you've donenothing but block my every attempt to solve it. Why are you fightingme?", "What do you mean by that?", "Would you rather endanger Deanna, a friend and a colleague,than tell me what is going on?!", "Are you saying that by not cooperating, you are actuallyprotecting us?", "Then, Mister Data, I'm going to ask you again, and I order youto directly answer me. What really happened to us?", "What would you have me do, Data? How would you handle this ifour positions were reversed?", "Do you know what a court martial would mean? Your career inStarfleet would be finished.", "Do you also realise that you would most likely be stripped downto your wires to find out what the hell has gone wrong?", "During the missing day?", "Are you suggesting he was conscious?", "And our memories of that day?", "By whom?", "I can't accept that explanation.", "Granted, but I'm beginning to suspect that Commander Data isrefusing to co-operate because he believes he is acting in the bestinterests of the Enterprise.", "Go ahead, Geordi.", "Acknowledged. Maybe now we'll get some answers.", "What do you have, Mister La Forge?", "The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-calledwormhole.", "That's because there is no a wormhole. There never was.", "It was a ruse, designed to throw us off the track. Look at theclues. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, the computer clock, thetransporter trace. All indicate the existence of a missing day. Lieutenant Worf's broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awakeand aware for that day, possibly in a struggle for our lives.", "Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behaviour would seem to suggestwe did not. Why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career ratherthan tell the truth?", "Then the only alternative would be a stalemate. Maybe acompromise might have been reached, a compromise that forced Data intothis silence.", "Possibly, Number One, and I would be prepared to live with themystery, but Data's role in this must be ascertained or he'll never betrusted with starship duty again. Ensign, take us back to the scene ofthe crime. The T-tauri system, warp two.", "Drop to impulse, Ensign. Mister Worf, maximum shields. Readyall weapons.", "On screen. Hold position. Let's see what it does.", "Let's see what happens when it hits the shields.", "Well, Data, as you can see, we're back where it all started.", "Why?", "Why? What is the source of that risk? The energy field?", "Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a feedback loop. Youcertainly can say. You have free will, you have a choice.", "Not by choice? Are you somehow being controlled by that force? Did Geordi miss something when he examined you?", "Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders? How? Duringthe missing day, were you contacted by Starfleet? Did they order you toconceal the truth from us?", "This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Nowwho gave you that order?", "I ordered you to lie?", "Do as Data says. At once.", "The Paxans. Who are they?", "No, Worf.", "We are not invaders. We are explorers.", "What went wrong this time?", "Status, Data.", "Options, Mister Worf?", "Can we go to warp?", "No, stop, everyone. Who are you?", "If you destroy this ship, then others will come in search ofus. You may not be able to stop them all. Knowledge of yourcivilisation would be spread across half the galaxy.", "Allow us safe passage and I will protect your right to privacyto the best of my ability. We will never tell anyone of your existence.", "This biochemical stasis, does it suppress synaptic functions?", "Then you must have the capability of affecting memory. Can youerase the short-term memory of everyone on this ship, remove allknowledge of this event, allow us to proceed as if it had neverhappened?", "Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not surethat you will be able to integrate it into yourprogramme.", "Good, because our survival depends upon it. I am ordering younever to reveal what has happened here today. Not to Starfleet, not tomyself. You will conceal your knowledge of the Paxans for as long asyou exist. Do you fully understood, Data?", "Satisfactory?", "Good. Now, our task is to eliminate from the ship's records anyinformation that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get towork.", "Here we are again.", "No. Wait. The plan failed because clues were left behind thatsuggested a mystery. And to many humans, a mystery isirresistible. It must be solved. The Doctor's incubation experiment,Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations. Little pieces of evidence thatsuggested even more clues. The clock, the transporter trace, Data's oddbehaviour. If we eliminate the clues and begin again", "Yes. Consider the first time a run-through, a rehearsal toshake out the flaws. The second time will succeed if we leave no clues.", "Welcome back. Counsellor. Geordi, Data, reconfigure thecomputer and the records. Number One, I want you to oversee the rest ofthe ship. And this time, let's get it right.", "What happened, Data?", "So it would seem.", "How long were we out?", "It could be worse.", "The Enterprise went through a wormhole, Doctor. It seems theentire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.", "Apparently not.", "Status reports?", "Counsellor?", "Well, then. There's still that anomalous class-M planet we weregoing to investigate. Ensign, replot a course to take us back to", "Make it so. And put out a hazard advisory to Starfleet.

Chancellor, there is no starshipmission more dangerous than that of first contact. We never know whatwe will face when we open the door on a new world, how we will begreeted, what exactly the dangers will be. Centuries ago, a disastrouscontact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decidedthen we would do surveillance before making contact. It was acontroversial decision. I believe it prevented more problems than itcreated.", "In time there would have been full disclosure. I can only askyou to believe that. On other worlds it would not be an issue. Buthere, everything our observers reported indicated that the people ofthis world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. Wecould see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act ofaggression. I hoped that we would have found Commander Riker before youdid so the matter would not complicate our introduction. It was amistake.", "Like it?", "Chancellor, I have made some fine ones in my time.

Are you aware ofany other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might haveencountered recently?", "This ship has encountered several incidents which might suggesta potential alliance between those two powers.", "Come.", "Please, Mister Worf, come in. I particularly want my guest tomeet you. Admiral Satie. This is my Head of Security, Lieutenant Worf.", "Mister Worf, you may have him confined.", "But if you're right, someone else may be involved.", "I can scarcely believe it myself, but I am so grateful for yourpresence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you.", "In what way?", "That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie.", "Only from his writings. His judgments were required reading atthe Academy.", "I'm willing to wager that you trounced your brothers duringthose debates.", "You must miss him very much.", "Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we appreciate your time. You areexcused now. Mister Worf, will you bring in the next person?", "Please sit down, Mister Tarses. For the record, will you tellus your name and position?", "I assure you this is an informal inquiry. We are not accusingyou of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be providedfor you.", "Tell me, how long have you held your appointment onboard thisvessel?", "You're excused, crewman.", "Mister Worf?", "It's clear that he's frightened, but that's hardly anindication", "Admiral. I have to tell you, you must notexpect me to permit any action against Mister Tarses solely on thebasis of Betazoid intuition.", "I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid.", "There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator.", "Yes, I do, but I would not act solely on the basis of herinstinct.", "But you're asking, you're asking me to restrict Mister Tarses'movements solely on the basis on Sabin's feeling.", "Yes, I admit I probably would. And perhaps I should re-evaluatethat behaviour.", "If we had clear evidence.", "No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause todo so.", "Yes, Mister La Forge.", "I'll be right there.", "There are submicron fractures in the metal casing.", "If my crew say there was no sabotage, then you can be surethere was none.", "Do we know that for sure?", "I agree it would be difficult, but not impossible.", "Now, please! Let me remind you he is innocent until he isproved guilty.", "Very well. But let us put this to rest as quickly as possible.", "You've opened the hearing to spectators?", "Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise", "This hearing is convened on Stardate 44780 as a continuinginquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. Mister Tarses, foryour own protection, I have assigned a counsel to you in the person ofCommander William Riker.", "Thank you, Doctor. If you have a case to make againstTarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here andnow.", "Agreed. Mister Sabin.", "Mister Worf?", "I need to speak with you.", "Do you see what is happening here, Mister Worf?", "This is not unlike a drumhead trial.", "Five hundred years ago, military officers would upend a drum onthe battlefield sit at it and dispense summary justice. Decisions werequick, punishments severe, appeals denied. Those who came to a drumheadwere doomed.", "That's true, and he will stand for his crimes.", "How?", "That is not a crime, Worf. Nor can we infer his guilt becausehe didn't respond.", "Oh, no. We cannot allow ourselves think that. The SeventhGuarantee is one of the most important rights granted by theFederation. We cannot take a fundamental principle of the Constitutionand turn it against a citizen.", "Oh, yes. That's how it starts. But the road from legitimatesuspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think. Something is wrong here, Mister Worf. I don't like what we have become.", "There you are, Mister Tarses. Would you care for some lemon?", "Well, tell me a little about yourself, Crewman. I know you wereborn on Mars Colony.", "Did you ever consider applying to the Academy, going the wholeroute, apply to become an officer?", "An elm tree with a circular bench?", "I spent many an hour there. It was my favourite spot to study.", "You didn't do it.", "Not if you aren't guilty, Simon.", "Admiral Satie?", "Admiral Satie?", "I would like to have a word with you.", "In private and off the record.", "But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied to himabout the Engine Room. There were no volatile chemicals found there.", "We are hounding an innocent man.", "I've talked with him.", "No, he admits his mistake in falsifying his application. Thatdoes not make him a traitor.", "The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will goto Starfleet Command.", "What are you saying?", "You never told me about this.", "Admiral, what you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral. I'll fight it.", "Yes? Yes, yes, of course. Proceed, Mister Data.", "Yes, of course, Number One. Just a little preoccupied.", "Jean-Luc Picard.", "Captain, Federation Starship Enterprise.", "For three years, since stardate 41124.", "If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to say.", "I believe that Chapter Four, Article Twelve of the Uniform Codeof Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioningbegins.", "I am deeply concerned by what is happening here. It began whenwe apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answerfor his crime. But the hunt didn't end there. Another man, Mister SimonTarses, was brought to trial and it was a trial, no matter what otherschoose to call it. A trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothingsubstantive offered against Mister Tarses, much less proven. MisterTarses' grandfather is Romulan, and for that reason his career nowstands in ruins. Have we become so fearful? Have we become so cowardlythat we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a currentenemy? Admiral, let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else,because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocentassociations. I implore you, do not continue with this proceeding. Endit now.", "Of course.", "Your point, Admiral?", "My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each ofthose instances", "I beg your pardon?", "I was following orders to take this ambassador to a locationnear the Neutral Zone.", "That's correct.", "No.", "Lieutenant.", "Yes, I have completely recovered.", "You know, there some words I've known since I was a school boy. With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured,the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us allirrevocably. Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdomand warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're alldamaged. I fear that today", "No. Please, Mister Worf. Come in.", "That's good.", "We think we've come so far. The torture of heretics, theburning of witches, it's all ancient history. Then, before you canblink an eye, it suddenly threatens to start all over again.", "Mister Worf, villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easyto spot.

But if the Duras are being aided by the Romulans, itbecomes very much our concern. The Romulans have been attempting todestroy the Klingon-Federation Alliance for the past twenty years. Atthe same time, the Duras have been secretly conspiring with theRomulans. Doesn't it strike you as odd that the Duras are able to fieldsuch an overpowering force against Gowron? That they outmatch him atalmost every turn?", "And some would say they must be getting help. The Romulans areprepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over theFederation. Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of theKlingon Empire in the balance, they are content to stand by and watch?", "We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Durasfrom the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to theRomulan-Klingon border.

What possible advantage could there be to theRomulans? As this now stands, I don't think this will have any impacton our strategy. We'll continue the blockade, leave the next move tothem.

Iwant to reassure you that we have no hostile intention.", "It is our intent to prevent any external power from interferingin Klingon affairs.", "Then why don't you just take your ships across?", "All right. Why did I invite you here?", "It's been suggested that she was aboard the Enterprise C whenit was destroyed twenty four years ago, that she was one of thesurvivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between herand a Romulan.", "And yet you claim that it is possible, that you're the daughterof Tasha Yar.", "I want to meet your mother. Can you arrange that?", "Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing in my experience canpersuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know onething.

We must expose their involvement before thedeadline.", "If you launch a full-scale attack now, then the Duras fleetwill call for supplies. Lursa and B'Etor will call for help. TheRomulans will try to run the blockade, and we'll be ready for them.", "When Gowron begins his attack, then we willmake our move. Excalibur will fall back with engine problems. You willtake the Akagi and the Hornet to this position, which will open a smallgap in our detection net.", "Exactly.

Very well. MisterData, will you contact Holza, arrange a meeting?", "Well, let's hope that you're mistaken, Ensign. But can youpoint us at the right individual, as Mister Data suggested? RO", "I'm pleased you agreed to meet with us, Mister Keeve.", "Ensign Ro has educated me.", "Do you know where we can find Orta?", "Can you help us locate him?", "Then I don't understand why you are unwilling?", "We were saddened by those events but they occurred within thedesignated borders of the Cardassian Empire.", "Well, I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but Ican offer you assistance.", "We've had our problems with the Cardassians too, but now thatwe have a treaty, we're in a position to help. Your people have beenforced to resettle all over the quadrant. But now we can make alegitimate case with the Cardassians that this is not an isolatedproblem.

RO", "Arming these people is a violation of everything that theFederation stands for. Even you cannot be blind to that. RO", "Have you made this offer to Orta? RO", "That was a wise choice, Ensign. It probably saved you fromanother court martial. Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly since wereturned from the surface? RO", "Then we have one thing in common. Do you think that Orta wouldcooperate with us to determine the truth here? RO", "Good. Our orders were to find him, to bring him back to thecamps any way we could. Perhaps that is exactly what we should do. RO", "And then watch what happens. Captain's log, supplemental. I have becomeconvinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy.

It lookssomething like this. I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassianvirus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion Four. Nowwe have a common enemy, he says. The Bajoran terrorists. TheCardassians can't find them, but maybe the Federation can.

I suspected that something like this might occur.", "Admiral, I am more concerned with protecting the honour andintegrity of Starfleet.", "The Bajorans did not attack Solarion Four.", "Yes.", "Admiral, Orta's ships are old and obsolete. They don't evenhave warp capabilities. They couldn't have reached another star system,let alone attacked one.", "I would suggest you ask your friend the Cardassian liaison,Admiral. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassiansstaged it.", "Perhaps they were hoping to find someone in Starfleet like you,Admiral, naive enough to solve their Bajoran problem for them.

Place it under guard.", "I realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some ofus, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be inorder, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy.", "Including questionnaires, Mister Worf.", "We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide,here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gasto form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of thesun.", "I'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good luck, Geordi.", "We're glad to be of help, Doctor. TheEnterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress. Picard out.", "Ensign, return to synchronous orbit.", "What kind of questions did he have for you,Number One?", "Location?", "Is La Forge still down there?", "Find him.", "Magnify.", "Are you all right?", "On screen.", "What about the dust?", "The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released.", "Sort them out, Commander.", "And look what we've done.", "The good news.", "That would be like striking a spark in a gas-filled room.", "Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod?", "And the bad news?", "Meaning?", "Come.", "I imagine you know why I've asked you here.", "I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which isslowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm toldthat in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die.", "Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame.", "Commander La Forge has a possible solution. The margins oferror are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no morethreat.", "Every living thing on the planet will perish.", "Not if you were to help me.", "Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask youthat. But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, andyou know what happened to them. What will happen to them.", "Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions,Professor, and now, I have twenty million reasons to do so.", "Because your presence gives me potential access to a kind ofinformation that I've never had available to me before, and if I am tore-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possibleasset. It would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here.", "How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die?", "Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save downthere is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or KhanSingh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked thatquestion ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this isnot a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's nothypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that?", "I have two choices. Either way, one version of history oranother will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one. Now who is to say which is better? What I do know is here, today, oneway, millions of lives could be saved. Nowisn't that incentive enough?", "Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us thatwe have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alienworlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I havedisregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thoughtit was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to sometemporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't itpossible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to helpme to choose, because it's the right thing to do?", "Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do Iask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday onCorsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of athousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believethat if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is myfuture and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet.", "How long will it take to programme thephasers, Number One?", "Oh, on the contrary, Professor, you were quite helpful.", "By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice Ihad to began with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play itsafe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to chooseis. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try. Mister Data, programme the firing sequence.", "It's time for you return to the ship, Mister La Forge. MisterO'Brien, stand by to transport.", "Mister La Forge, you know better than anyone there's noguarantee this will work. If it fails", "Permission granted.", "Good luck, Commander.", "Mister La Forge?", "Report back to the ship when you're ready, Commander. Doctor,we'll stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances,but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own.", "I'm afraid we're going to have to take a look in your vessel.", "A number of objects have been discovered missing in the lasttwo days, and if they're in your possession, then we would like themreturned.", "Because if I order Data never to divulge what he sees in there,he won't, with the exception of anything that might belong to us.", "Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it alreadyhas, eh, Professor?", "Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allowthat?", "A pity you weren't a bit more inventive. If fewer things haddisappeared, we might never have suspected you. As it was, the onlystumbling block was your ship. Our sensors couldn't penetrate it. Butonce the door was opened, the computer was able to detect anddeactivate everything you'd stolen, including this.", "I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians atStarfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era.

Engage atwarp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode.", "Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal.", "Understood, Commander. Keep us informed of your efforts. Picardout. I'll be in Sickbay.", "We've already checked those possibilities. The initial findingswould seen to indicate that there was a radiation surge from theRomulan engine core which disrupted the signal. They neverrematerialised.", "Beverly, we've done everything that we can.", "None that I know of, but I'll check with the Bajoran liaisonOffice. RO", "Picard to Riker.", "Good.", "What is the status of the enginereplacement?", "Very well.", "By all means.", "Permission granted. Make whatever arrangements you think areappropriate.", "That would explain why they're so far awayfrom Romulan space. To avoid being picked up on Federation long rangescans.", "Commander, there'll be a memorial service at twenty threehundred hours this evening. Mister Data is making arrangements.", "You did know La Forge longer than any of us.", "When you're ready, coordinate with Mister Data. RO", "On screen.", "Understood. Disconnect the power-transfer beam.", "It was our pleasure, Mirok. And I hope that this example ofcooperation between our two peoples will not be an isolated incident.", "Set a course for the Garadius system. Warp six.", "Very well. Let me know when you finished your sweep.", "You have the Bridge, Mister McDowell. I'll be at the service inTen Forward.", "Deck ten. I've been thinking about thefirst time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned topilot me on an inspection tour, and I made some off hand remark aboutthe shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. And the nextmorning I found that he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusioninitiators. Well, I knew then that I wanted him with me on my nextcommand. Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro?", "Situations like these are never easy, Number One. RO", "Well, this is unusual.", "if she hadn't lost her rank as a result of that incident atGaron Four, I think she would've made Lieutenant Commander by now.", "Go ahead.", "Stand by, Ensign.", "I would like to get under way as soon as possible. Thesituation on Garadius Four is becoming serious.", "Excellent. Mister McDowell, will you set course for GaradiusFour and engage at", "Very well.", "Did you see that, Mister Data?", "These were not ghosts. what did we see?", "Are you saying that they're still alive?", "That was Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign. Please follow hisinstructions.", "Magnify. Mister Data?", "Increase power to", "What is this place?", "Computer, freeze programme. Computer, end programme.", "Picard to Enterprise.", "I asked you, what is this place?", "Am I a prisoner here?", "Are you in charge here?", "I want to be returned to my ship immediately.", "Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I?", "That must be it. Perhaps you can help me.", "My name is Kamin?", "And you are?", "Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill?", "Eline?", "And what is this place?", "No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me.", "What planet?", "No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet?", "Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk.", "The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myselfwith the surroundings.", "Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not adream, doesn't it?", "This is not my life. I know that much.", "I walked. For hours.", "It's delicious.", "Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter howstrange they may seem to you?", "Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit othersystems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do yousend messages to other communities, to other places?", "Yes. When can that be arranged?", "Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er,um, married?", "And what do I do here in Ressik?", "The flute?", "And when did I learn to play it?", "I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank youfor your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message?", "Oh, I'll sleep here.", "I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't befair to you.", "Where did youget this?", "I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It mightgive a clue to the cause of this drought.", "The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me.", "Eline.", "It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect meto forget a lifetime spent there.", "I know. I know. It has been hard on you.", "Good morning, Batai.", "Yes. Will you come along?", "It's not her fault. These past few years have been verydifficult for her.", "If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing will not beenough. We'll run out of water.", "No. I haven't spoken to you before.", "I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which couldextract water from the air.", "Each community would be responsible for its own. Condenserscould make the difference between watering our crops or watching themdie.", "But there'll be no atmospheric condensers.", "Come and have supper tonight, my friend. I'll make somevegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser.", "I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music.", "I find that it helps me think, but the real surprise is I enjoyit so much.", "Goodnight, my friend.", "Yes, ma'am.", "No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morningwas absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and youhave given me so much.", "No, not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare timecharting the stars. I disappear for days at a time exploring thecountryside. My life is very much as it was. Old habits.", "I'd like to ask your permission to build something.", "In this case, I think I do.", "A nursery.", "Unless, of course, if you would prefer a porch. It wouldcertainly be easier to build. I could make a start on it right away.", "We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. Butnow his memory will live on in his namesake.", "And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you. Please, help yourselves to something to eat.", "Thank you.", "I remember. I was so nervous I was afraid that I would dropher. Now look at the little lady.", "I would have believed I didn't need children to complete mylife. Now I couldn't imagine life without them.", "Meribor?", "Hey, that's my hobby. Find your own.", "And what has the scientist been up to today?", "I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn'tfunction by conjecture.", "Hey, why don't you spend more time with that young fellowDannick?", "No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you.", "Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns. Games and toys and clothes.", "No, I don't. It just saddens me to see you burdened with theknowledge things you can't change.", "Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the mostprecious time. Now will never come again.", "Yes, thank you, dear.", "Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you'resupposed to.", "He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all hewanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. Iwish he could find some focus in his life.", "Batai? JR", "I get the feeling from your mother that you have something totell me. JR", "Leaving school? No, you're not. JR", "Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year beforethat, botany. Now JR", "Well, we'll discuss it. JR", "If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way? Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream.", "There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council.", "No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent.", "The facts are here. At least show them to someone who willrecognise what they mean.", "If you won't take them, I most certainly will.", "But surely the technology must exist to save something of thisworld? Perhaps some people could be evacuated.", "A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. Yousimply cannot let this civilisation die.", "What is it? JR", "Doctor?", "You always did have a flair for the dramatic.", "I didn't have to. They already knew.", "No.", "I promise.", "Gotcha! Now I gotcha.", "You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that.", "How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protectoroutdoors? You do? Good boy. JR", "What launching? What's he talking about?", "I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. JR", "It breaks my heart to look at him.", "My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,and he's not going to get one.", "Why didn't I hear anything about a launching?", "Did everyone know about this except me? I'll be all rightsitting here. You go off with the others. Hold onto my grandson, andwatch the damned thing go up for all the good it'll do. What is itthey're launching?", "Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen anymissile.", "Batai?", "Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future.", "Eline.", "Eline.", "What?", "Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long?", "Twenty five minutes?", "Doctor Crusher.", "Come.", "Yes. Yes, thank you. But I find I'm having to rediscover thatthis is really my home.", "And it's been determined that they date back to the latenineteenth century?", "What makes you think that extraterrestrials are related tothese discoveries.", "Triolic waves?", "I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth toinvestigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home?", "Data, is this yours?", "Could it be Lore?", "Type R?", "Can you predict how long this has been in the cavern?", "A cellular fossil?", "Number One, lay in a course.", "Picard to Bridge officers. We're approaching the Devidiasystem. Report to your stations.", "Any sign of life?", "Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates.", "Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids?", "Take an away team.", "Mister Data, I'll need your help to monitor the sensor readingsduring this investigation.", "Yes, yes, Mister Data, I am aware of that.", "I think it is reasonable to take precautions.", "Then I'll be irrational.", "I hope that's true, Mister Data. Nevertheless, thisinvestigation began with your death. I am simply trying to see that itdoesn't end that way.", "Cheat fate? Perhaps we can't, Mister Data. But at least we cangive it a try.", "Go ahead.", "Proceed, Mister Data.", "Commander Riker, report.", "We cannot make Mister Data our priority.", "We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be. Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with theselife forms.", "Can you build one?", "I don't want anyone else going in alone.", "Make it so.", "Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hopeso.", "And miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operationsince the Academy lab final in exochemistry.", "What is it you wanted to see me about?", "Well, now, this is rather unusual for you to be curious aboutan away mission.", "If you have something to say, I'm listening.", "It's general policy.", "Why?", "Of course.", "How soon will you be ready?", "I have reason to believe that my presence on this mission isimperative.", "Yes. Mister Worf, you will report back to the Bridge.", "The security of the Enterprise is of paramount importance,Mister Worf.", "Proceed, Mister La Forge.", "If we can see them, why they can't see us?", "A life form.", "We cannot make Mister Data our priority.", "Of course.", "And if they're moving among humans, they must have taken onhuman form. But the question is, how do we know who we're looking for?", "Yes, Mrs. Carmichael.", "Yes.", "Ah, yes, er, the rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my troupe arein rehearsals for a new production.", "The play? A Midsummer Night's Dream. We have performed inLondon, Paris, Milan. Milan. To sold out houses. I assure you, you willhave the rent, in full, with a bonus.", "Replacing the burners. City ordinance. Makes it safer in caseof earthquake.", "Well, that's takes care of this ward. Time to be moving on.", "We'll be on our way.", "Let's go.", "Agreed. Get us out of here.", "We need someone to read a part. You're just in time.", "Now, Mrs. Carmichael Right there.", "Well, I don't think I need to hear any more. That was trulyunique.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have found our Titania. Don'tyou agree?", "Well, there you are. We start rehearsals tomorrow.", "Very well.", "Not yet. But you will.", "If we can get back there and destroy that site, it might put anend to their time travelling.", "We have no choice but to try.", "Follow him!", "Gently. Don't sit up too quickly.", "I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now.", "You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right.", "I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far tooimportant to me.", "Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned.", "It goes far beyond friendship.", "No. Because for me, none of this will have happened yet.", "That's history fulfilling itself.", "Can you communicate?", "You're injured.", "You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that.", "Perhaps we can find a substitute.", "We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew havereturned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site onDevidia Two.", "I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here.", "No, you need help.", "Now you have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention.", "And there is a bill to be settled at Mrs. Carmichael's boardinghouse.", "Thank you. I wish, I wish time would have allowed me to knowyou better.", "And I'll see you in a few minutes.", "He has indeed, Commander. And believe me, it's good to beback.", "Magnify.", "Hail them.", "Life signs?", "Can we tractor them out?", "Too risky. You could be pulled in too. Bridge to Engineering.", "Mister La Forge, can we beam an awayteam onto the science ship?", "Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter roomthree.", "Is there any evidence to support this?", "I have an away team on board the ship. The initial reportindicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it wasfrom an attack.", "A few hours. If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact youimmediately.", "Go ahead, Mister Data.", "Acknowledged. Have Commander Riker come to my Ready room assoon as he's on board.", "Is there evidence of a hull breach? Could plasma from thestreamer have found its way into the ship?", "If the plasma exploded that would explain a few things. Let meknow when the analysis is complete.", "Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerableamount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that yousimply imagined", "Commander La Forge, get Mister O'Brien. Take that transportersystem apart piece by piece if you have to. Mister Worf, I want a levelthree security alert until further notice.", "Keep me apprised. Dismissed.", "Is the transport still under attack?", "On screen.", "Open a channel, Mister Worf.", "This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starshipEnterprise.", "Do you have injuries? Can we assist you in any way?", "Of course.", "Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead and beam your passengers onboard. Counsellor, after you've seen to their needs will you escortthem to my Ready room.", "With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on boardanother unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault.", "Picard to Commander Riker.", "Set a course for Seronia.", "You wanted to see me, Doctor?", "What are you suggesting?", "Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to theEnterprise?", "Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes.", "But I was under the impression there was a cease fire agreement.", "Ambassador, the situation sounds so volatile. Perhaps a coolingoff period?", "Then I would recommend that we ask both sides if they wouldagree to meet in the city of Darthen.", "It's a coastal city that has been neutral throughout theconflict. Both Seronians and Rekag loyalists live there. It might beacceptable as a compromise.", "Ambassador, I came to alert you that theRekags and the Seronians are in disagreement about the seatingarrangements at the conference table.", "The good news, however, is that the cease fire seems to beholding.", "Chief.", "Deanna?", "Security to Transporter room two.", "It's nothing, it's superficial. What happened to Deanna?", "No. You should proceed with your mission.", "Chief, transport them to the planet surface.", "It's a little stiff, but it'll be fine.", "Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her?", "Picard to Lieutenant Worf.", "Mister Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak withhim.", "Proceed with the autopsy. Medical log, stardate 46075.1. I have performed anautopsy on Alkar's mother, but instead of answering our questions, theresults have created an even deeper mystery.", "But how could that be? We both saw the woman.", "Picard to Lieutenant Worf.", "Meet me in Transporter room two. We're going down to thesurface.", "And she wasn't ninety three years old.", "Yes, for a very good reason. Counsellor Deanna Troi is inSickbay, dying. Doctor Crusher doesn't know the cause of her condition,but I believe you do.", "AlkarALKAR", "Is this what you've done to Counsellor Troi?", "So then you deliberately used Deanna.", "Receptacles?", "You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because youthink it is connected to some higher purpose.", "That does not justify brutalising her, nor any of the othersyou have used.", "Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you'remistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocentbecause you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasantemotions. Well, this time you will be held accountable. I'm taking youback to the Enterprise to release Counsellor Troi.", "Mister Worf.", "Lock on to Alkar's signal. Bring him on board.", "Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break throughit. I want that man on this ship.", "I'll be in Sickbay.", "He has no intention of stopping. He feels perfectly justifiedin using her until she dies.", "If Deanna dies, and he breaks the link with her, then he willchoose someone else, possibly someone from his own delegation.", "We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim atrisk. I want every possible security measure taken to protect thatperson.", "Proceed, Doctor.", "Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir.", "Ambassador, You must return to theEnterprise immediately. Counsellor Troi is dying.", "We are prepared to transport you fromthe surface whether you come willingly or not.", "They won't protect you any longer.", "Transporter room two, prepare to energise.", "I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done.", "Picard to Transporter Room Two lock on to the young woman inAmbassador Alkar's quarters. We may have to transport her out of there.", "Mister Worf, I want you to station yourself outside herquarters.", "Picard to Transporter room three", "Picard to Transporter room three, energise.", "Take us out of warp, Ensign. All stop.", "Report.", "Can you localise the source of the gravitational field?", "Why didn't we detect this before now?", "Mister Data, could this be a Dyson Sphere?", "It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that youhaven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist calledFreeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow spherecould be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage ofharnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living onthe interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources ofpower.", "Ensign Rager, put us into synchronous orbit above thatposition.", "Magnify.", "I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, CaptainScott.", "How are you feeling?", "I must say, I was little surprised when Commander Riker told methat you were aboard the Jenolen. Our records didn't show you listed asa member of the crew.", "I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to hearyou talk about your career. I'm sure you would have some fascinatinginsights into the events of your time.", "Good. Well, I look forward to it. Excuse me. Commander, we needto begin a full spectrographic analysis of the Dyson Sphere.", "Good. Once again, welcome on board, Captain.", "Is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited?", "Mister Data, send out a series of class-four probes to surveythe far side of the sphere. Perhaps we'll have more luck with them.", "I hope I'm not interrupting. I was just coming off duty and Iwanted to see how you were doing.", "Thank you.", "Aldebaran whiskey. Who do you think gave it to Guinan?", "Constitution class.", "There's one in the Fleet museum, but then of course, this isyour Enterprise?", "The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called theStargazer. It was an overworked, underpowered vessel, always on theverge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable sense, myEnterprise is far superior. But there are times when I would givealmost anything to command the Stargazer again.", "What do you think of the Enterprise D?", "But?", "Seventy five years is a long time. If you would care to studysome technical schematics or", "Come.", "Mister La Forge, I understand that before the Jenolen crashed,it had conducted an extensive survey of the Dyson sphere. Have we beenable to access any of those records?", "Perhaps Captain Scott could be of use in accessing thatmaterial.", "Mister La Forge, I would like you to accompany Captain Scott.", "Yes. Look, this is not an order, it's a request and it's onewhich you must feel perfectly free to decline. You see, one of the mostimportant things in a person's life is to feel useful. Now, MisterScott is a Starfleet officer and I would like him to feel useful again.", "Thank you.", "Mister Worf, open a channel to that communications array.", "Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. Where are we?", "Manoeuvring thrusters?", "No, but it may be enough to turn us into orbit, hold ourdistance from the photosphere. Ensign, port thrusters ahead full,starboard thrusters back full.", "Very well. Mister Data, begin a scan of the interior surfacefor life forms. I want to know who brought us in here and why.", "Then that would explain why they abandoned it. But if there'sno one still living there, how were we brought inside?", "Shields?", "Mister Worf, can we use the phasers to open a hole in thesphere?", "Mister Data, we have to find some way out of here. Beginscanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open.", "Go ahead, Commander. We read you.", "Understood. Ensign, set a course.", "How much longer before we reach them?", "Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam two from theJenolen as soon as we're within range.", "Bridge to Transporter room. Energise.", "Fire torpedoes.", "Well, call it an extended loan. Since you lost your ship savingours, it seemed only fair.", "Well, bon voyage, Mister Scott.", "What's causing it?", "But I thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space.", "Does it pose a danger to the ship?", "Well, keep that option ready. In the meantime, proceed with theanalysis.", "Tetryons? Like the emissions in the cargo bay.", "Computer, are there any members of the crew of the Enterprisemissing?", "Identify them.", "When did they leave?", "How did they leave?", "Picard to Bridge.", "Raise shields. And I want a level four security alert. I needto know if anyone comes on or off this ship.", "Mister La Forge, Mister Data. I believe that if we find thesource of those tetryon emissions, we'll find the missing crewmembers.", "Initiate a metallurgical analysis of the ship's hull. Subspacefield incursions may have left a trace.", "Can we still beam the affected sections out into space?", "Has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal thisrupture?", "If someone homed onto the subspace signals created by ourmodified signal array, could we do the same to them? Track the tetryonemissions to their universe?", "Well, we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned,Number One, but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship,then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse.", "Perhaps there's a way that we could give you an advantage. Away of keeping you conscious after they have taken you. Doctor, can youdevelop some counter-agent to the neuro-sedative that they have beengiving the crew?", "Make it so. Mister La Forge, begin work on that homing device.", "Mister La Forge, report.", "Mister Data, your status?", "Can you divert more power to thecontainment field?", "Make it so.", "Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse.", "Mister Data, how much time?", "We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse.", "Can you strengthen the graviton pulse?", "What can we do to prevent this from happening again?", "Have we any idea what came through the rupture before we wereable to shut it down?", "Welcome to the Enterprise, Miss Rogers. I'm delighted to have you aboard.", "And congratulations. I understand that you were selected forthis internship out of hundreds of applicants.", "Or at least what fields you're not interested in.", "Come.", "Commander, will you escort Miss Rogers to her quarters? I needto discuss the Tagran's medical needs with Doctor Crusher. And MissRogers?", "You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it.", "Commander, have you been able to determine the cause of thewarp breach?", "Q! Q", "Are you responsible for the incident in Engineering? Q", "That being? Q", "I find it hard to believe that you're here to do us a favour. Q", "Q, what is it you really want? Q", "I don't trust you, Q. Why should I expect Amanda to? Q", "But what if she doesn't want that future? It must be herdecision. Q", "But if she really is Q, she must understand what that means. Very well, I will introduce you. But we cannot argue like this in frontof her. We must at least appear to be Q", "Civil. Q", "Mister Data, I want you to access anyavailable records on Amanda Rogers.", "I want to know about her biological parents, about their death. I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident.", "I'm convinced that Q isn't telling us everything. See what youcan find out.", "Amanda, allow me to introduce, er, Q. He's er, he's anacquaintance of ours. We've er, we've known him for years. Q", "Amanda, what Q is asking is have you ever deliberately usedyour abilities?", "Q", "You agreed that she has a right to chooseher own future. The first chance you get you try to abduct her. Q", "What's going on, Q? What's your real purpose here? Q", "If you wish to protect that investment, I suggest that youapproach her differently. Q", "If I'm not mistaken, she just did.", "Number One Doctor Crusher has some livevaccine bacilli to be delivered to Tagra. It'll have to be shipped in astasis field. Will you make the arrangements?", "On screen.", "Perhaps my Chief Engineer could be of assistance?", "Send us your design specifications I'm sure we'll be able tohelp.", "What is it, Mister Data?", "A tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the weather modificationnet?", "See if you can find out any more details, Mister Data. I'd liketo know more about that storm.", "Yes, Mister Data?", "What is it?", "Download the files to my Ready room. I'll study them there.", "I wanted to ask you about Amanda's biological parents. Whenthey decided to remain on Earth, what was the reaction in the QContinuum? Q", "Were they pressured to return? Were they threatened with anypunishment if they didn't? Q", "Well, the circumstance of their death's quite odd. A tornadosomehow escaped the weather modification net and touched down in onlyone spot. Amanda's home. Q", "But tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts. But you see,there were no storm fronts in Kansas that day. Witnesses reported thatthe funnel materialised spontaneously directly over Amanda's home,destroyed it, and disappeared. Q", "Were Amanda's parents executed by the Q Continuum? Q", "Then I think she has a right to know that before she makes achoice about her future. Q", "You would be so despicable? Q", "So what have you concluded? Does she live or does she die? Q", "Look, I have no reason to believe that Q islying. He claims he has orders from the Continuum. If Amanda cannotprove that she is fully Q, then he must kill her.", "I agree with the Counsellor. Amanda deserves to know the truthof her situation. We have no right to withhold such crucial informationfrom her. But it isn't going to be easy telling her.", "They're not convinced that you are fully Q. And they are alsoresponsible for your parent's death.", "Amanda's question deserves an answer, Q. You've made yourselfjudge, jury, and if necessary executioner. By what right have youappointed yourself to this position? Q", "Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we firstencountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity. Q", "Your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of theuniverse strikes me as being hollow, Q. I see no evidence that you areguided by a superior moral code, or any code whatsoever. You may benearly omnipotent, and I don't deny that your parlour tricks are veryimpressive, but morality? I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it, Q. Iwould put human morality against the Q's any day. And perhaps that'sthe reason that we fascinate you so. Because our puny behaviour showsyou a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence, a moralcentre. And if so, I can think of no crueller irony than that youshould destroy this young woman, whose only crime is that she's toohuman. Q", "I'm on my way.", "Can you correct the problem?", "Is this your doing, Q? Q", "Mister Worf, see if there's any way we can do to cut throughthe interference and beam them out of there.", "On screen.", "Amanda? Q", "And I found these pieces in the tertiarylevel of the dig. They're typical of second century Marlonian cookware. Look at those markings. They're very similar to early Taguan designs,but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranianthan Taguan.", "It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments. They're very nearly in perfect condition and yet they're seven hundredyears old.", "Can you identify the problem?", "Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon aswe're on board.", "Hard about, full impulse. RO", "Transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers.", "Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Another moment and", "What happened to the shuttlecraft, Number One?", "We can't afford to stay here any longer. We'll leave a classfour probe behind to study the energyfield but the distress signal from Ligos Seven has top priority. Let meknow as soon as you have any further information, Doctor. Number One,you're with me.", "Of course. The three of you will remain as needed to assistDoctor Crusher. RO JR", "Bridge. JR", "Mister Worf.

I don'tknow anything about you. Where you're from, what your interests are,your last name.", "No, no, not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman.", "You're certainly not an old lady.", "I wasn't. I was a puerile adolescent who allowed himself to beled by his hormones instead of his head. Q", "Of course.", "She decided to leave.", "Corey, don't play him.", "It'll cause trouble. He's a Nausicaan. They can get veryill-tempered if they lose.", "No, Corey, listen to me. This is a big mistake. Don't play him.", "I'm sorry to disappoint you. Q", "He's going to lose. The Nausicaan is cheating. Q", "If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out latertonight, and then he'll want revenge. Q", "I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in arematch. Q", "It was a stupid mistake. The Nausicaan didn't take kindly tolosing. Nor his friends. They were outraged. They wanted a fight. Igave them one. Q", "Corey, that won't solve anything.", "All it'll do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not agood idea.", "What if he's not alone? What if he brings some of his Nausicaanfriends with him?", "Corey, there's got to be a better way to handle this.", "Look Corey, we're not cadets anymore. We're officers. We shouldstart to set a higher standard for ourselves.", "I hope so. What?", "Yes, that would be more in character, wouldn't it?", "Perhaps it's just that I'm getting older.", "It's going to take some getting used to.", "Oh, of course.", "Come. Q", "No, Q, you did not. Q", "We were friends, nothing more. Q", "My friendship with Marta is not something I regret. Q", "Q, what is it you want? Q", "Corey.", "Sorry.", "Corey, I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you frommaking a serious mistake.", "Cheating the Nausicaans could have serious consequences for allof us. It's a risk we can't afford to take.", "This is not a joke, Corey.", "I said you're not doing this.", "No. But I'll tell the gambling foreman someone's been tamperingwith his dom-jot table.", "I just couldn't make him understand.", "Yes, but he didn't take it very well.", "I hope you're right, because he and I were friends for yearsafter this. I mean, I hope we will be. You know, you keep smiling atme.", "Do I really seem that different?", "Really?", "Yes, I have, actually. I've thought about it for a long time.", "I don't know. And at this moment, I really have no idea whynot.", "I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. Q", "And we're still friends. Q", "I don't know. What I do know is, things will be different. Q", "Good morning.", "What's wrong?", "Look, I don't regret anything that happened last night. I hopeyou don't either.", "Then perhaps we should forget about what happened and try to", "I don't want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.", "I think you'll like serving on board theAjax. I hear that Captain Narth is an excellent officer.", "Well, here's to the class of 'twenty seven.", "I don't think we're interested. 1", "Don't be a fool, Corey. Look, there are plenty of other peopleto play dom-jot with. Now just go about your business.", "I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon.", "Mister Worf.", "What's happened?", "I'm not sure. Mister Worf, what is my rank and position?", "Who's the captain of this ship?", "No. I can find my own way there. Thank you, Commander.", "Beverly, something's happened to me. I'mnot sure Q", "Q, what have you done? Q", "But this is not the present I remember. You said nothing wouldchange. Q", "Excuse me, am I interrupting?", "Thank you. I'd like to talk to you for a moment about my futureon the Enterprise.", "No, please, Counsellor, I would very much like to hear yourthoughts. First of all, and I would like you to be absolutelystraightforward with me. How would you evaluate me as an officer?", "I see. What would you say if I told you that I believed that Iwas capable of being very much more.", "I would appreciate it if we could discuss it now. You see, Ifeel that I would like to move beyond astrophysics to Engineering orSecurity, something that might even lead to Command.", "Why?", "Please. This is important to me. I believe that I can do more.", "Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander?", "I see.", "Just not one who stands out.", "But, Command?", "All right, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q?", "I'm on my way, sir.", "Main Engineering. Are you having a goodlaugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest ofmy life as a dreary man in a tedious job? Q", "I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft ofpassion and imagination. That is not who I am. Q", "You're right, Q. You gave me the chance to change and I tookthe opportunity. But I admit now, it was a mistake. Q", "Give me a chance to put things back the way they were before. Q", "I would rather die as the man I was than live the life I justsaw.", "What did you say?", "That's what I thought you said.", "I still don't know what to make of it. Wasit a dream? Was it one of Q's elaborate tricks?", "And, you know, there's still a part of me that cannot acceptthat Q would give me a second chance, or that he would demonstrate somuch compassion. And if it was Q, I owe him a debt of gratitude.", "There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. Therewere loose threads, untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. Butwhen I pulled on one of those threads it unraveled the tapestry of mylife.", "Oh, well, to tell the truth, that wasn't the first run-in I'dhad with a couple of surly Nausicaans.", "Oh, yes.

Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I?", "There isn't a piano.", "That is remarkable. Why don't you play something?", "What shall we play?", "Bach, the third Brandenburg.", "I'm sorry.", "Just the computer.", "Number One, my fencing partner's cancelledfor this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me?", "It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it.", "Good. Excellent.

We just don't have the ears for it.", "Very good, Commander.", "We don't rendezvous with the Havana for another two days. That'll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon.", "Counsellor, could I speak with you in my Ready room? You havethe Bridge, Number One.", "Sit down, Counsellor. I want to talk to youabout a matter of protocol. I know there are no Starfleet regulationsabout a Captain becoming involved with a fellow officer, but", "It's that obvious?", "But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness.", "Yes. Relationships with co-workers can be fraught withconsequences.", "You seem I've always believed that becoming involved withsomeone under my command would compromise my objectivity. And yet.", "If I were, would you give it?", "Nella.", "I'm really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift. When the crewmember walked in, I felt very self-conscious. It's goingto take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the twoof us together.", "I can assure you that I'm not given to casual relationships. There is something that I want to tell you. But nothere.", "Do you remember that folk melody I playedfor you this morning?", "I learned it on a planet called Kataan.", "No, I'm not surprised. Its sun went nova more than a thousandyears ago.", "The Enterprise encountered a probe that had been sent from theplanet before it was destroyed. It had scanned me and I lostconsciousness, and in the space of twenty five minutes I lived alifetime on that planet. I had a wife, and children, and a grandchild. And it was absolutely real to me. When I awoke, all that I had left ofthat life there was the flute that I had taught myself to play.", "Because I want you to understand what my music means to me. Andwhat it means for me to be able to share it with someone.", "Come.", "Yes, of course. Come in, Number One.", "Because of her relationship with me?", "Are her requests unusual?", "Would you say that she's just trying to do her job?", "Then let her do it, and feel free to do yours. Ship's resourcesare your responsibility. I've always had absolute confidence in yourjudgment.", "No, no, no you're not. It's just that Commander Riker came totalk to me this afternoon. About you.", "That's what I told him. But we have to be careful. Obviouslyit's easy for people to misunderstand.", "All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of. But you mustn't compromise yourself. You must do what you have to do. Because if I find that my head of Stellar Sciences isn't beingeffective, then I shall do what I must to do and I shall replace her.", "Now, I think that we should just forget about this and enjoyout evening.", "Right. Now this is something that I first tasted on ThelkaFour.", "Go ahead, Mister Worf.", "I'm on my way. Captain's log, stardate 46693.1.

Is that understood?", "Which teams are missing?", "Go ahead, Mister Worf.", "I'm on my way.", "I'm so sorry.", "It must have been terrible.", "Part of you must have blamed me.", "I've lost people under my command. People who were very dear tome. But never someone I've been in love with. And when I believed thatyou were dead, I just began to shut down. I didn't want to think orfeel. I was here in my quarters, and the only thing I could focus onwas my music, and how it would never again give me any joy. Then I sawyou standing on the transporter pad and I knew that I could never againput your life in jeopardy.", "You could always resign your commission. Stay here with me.", "But we could still see each other. People do. We could arrangeshore leave together. And, for the future, who knows?", "Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quartersimpulse.", "Go ahead, Number One.", "I'll be right there.", "Oh, my God.", "Professor Galen?", "No one is could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I neverthought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth Dynasty?", "Oh, please, Mister will do fine. Well, the overallconfiguration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. The surface ornamentation.", "Green polychrome over the eyes, and the eyes themselves areclosed. This is third Dynasty. From the workshop of the Master ofTarquin Hill.", "Will, the Master of Tarquin Hill designed ceramic objects thatwere three hundred years ahead of their time. All we know of him is thework. His name has never been discovered. This object is over twelvethousand years old.", "Indeed. I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done longago.", "You mean it's complete?", "Will, the Kurlan civilisation believed that an individual was acommunity of individuals. Inside us are many voices, each with its owndesires, its own style, its own view of the world. The Kurlancivilisation died out thousands of years ago. It is extraordinarilyrare to find a figurine intact. Professor, this is an incredible find.", "Oh, no. No. How can I accept this?", "Thank you. How long can you stay? There's so much to talkabout.", "Two days? But that's not enough time.", "I don't understand.", "May I ask you a frank question?", "Your published writings have been sporadic for the last decade. Your appearance at symposia has been rare, or scheduled and thencancelled at the last moment. The finest archaeologist of the centuryis now shrouded with a cloak of mystery.", "I've never heard of anyone that didn't love a good mystery.", "So, what have you been doing for the past decade?", "Yes, it's the study of fossil records at the microscopic level. I read your papers on the subject, but that was years ago. It seemed asthough the work had stopped.", "Tell me.", "For how long?", "Why do you need my help in this?", "I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I haveresponsibilities.", "May I sleep on it?", "Dream not of today. The night blessing of the Yash-El.", "Well, I've had a few years to look it up. Professor, theEnterprise is yours for as long as you're here.", "Dream not of today.", "Come.", "Yes.", "I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked meto leave the Enterprise, to join him in an archaeological expeditionwhich could last for nearly a year.", "I couldn't leave the Enterprise. But the offer raised in mecertain feelings of regret.", "No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But theProfessor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices insidethe one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voiceinside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that.", "I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I would still make thesame choice I made all those years ago. I just wish that I didn't haveto say no to him a second time.", "I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. Andhe had his own children but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so Iwas like the son who understood him.", "In a way, I wish he'd never come on board the ship.", "Professor.", "Professor, I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn'tsomething that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go forgood. It's not something I'm not prepared to do.", "You don't believe that my career in Starfleet has been amistake.", "We both know that's not true.", "I never wanted to become", "I can't.", "But Professor, you're not scheduled to catch the Vulcan shipfor another two days.", "Take us out of warp. On screen.", "Get him out of there.", "Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems.", "Transporter Room One, lock on to Professor Galen and transporthim directly to Sickbay.", "What did they want?", "What do they mean?", "Apparently, the Yridians knew more about the Professor's workthan we do. They may have known what these numbers mean.", "Not necessarily. The Yridians are information dealers. They mayhave been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send asignal before they were destroyed?", "Did the shuttle's flight logs show where Galen had been beforecoming to the Enterprise?", "What's the distance from our present position?", "The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system.", "Scan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previouscivilisation.", "Then what was the foremost archaeologist in the Federationdoing here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep SpaceFour, and then an Al-Leyan transport to Caere, and then the shuttle toIndri Eight. Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight?", "Number One, we'll proceed to Indri Eight.", "I'm aware of the Federation's timetable, Number One. ProfessorGalen visited here a few days ago. And he was on his way to Indri Eightwhen he was killed. There's some connection between these two planets. I'm going to find it.", "Come.", "I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough then Iwould begin to see some kind of pattern. So far, nothing.", "If I had gone with him.", "I realise that.", "Counsellor, this is not simply a case of me taking theEnterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase to purge myself ofguilt and remorse. I will not let Galen's death to be in vain. Now, ifthat means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days,then so be it. I will take the full responsibility.", "On my way.", "On screen, Mister Worf.", "Can we stop it?", "All the life. Perhaps the Professor's number blocks hadsomething to do with organic matter.", "I'll be in the lab.", "fragments?", "The planets that these fragments are from are scattered acrossthe quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor so long to collect them. But why?", "But how can that be possible? They're different species fromdifferent planets. There should be no compatibility at all.", "What is it?", "An algorithm? Are you saying that these fragments areelements in some kind of computerprogramme?", "So, four billion years ago someone scattered this geneticmaterial into the primordial soup of at least nineteen differentplanets across the galaxy?", "And what was this programme designed to do?", "Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. MisterData, how many people on the Enterprise are from non-Federationplanets?", "You know, this may be a long shot, but we should check each oneof these seventeen people to see if they have the correct proteinconfigurations.", "To keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle. It's fourbillion years old. A computerprogramme from a highly advanced civilisation, and it's hidden in thevery fabric of life itself. Whatever information this programmecontains could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the mostdangerous. And the Professor knew that.", "Well I have been through every page of the Professor'spublished works, looking for some clue as to where to go next. So far,nothing.", "I was in the neighbourhood. When I asked the Professor why hewent all the way to Kurl, he said, I was in the neighbourhood. Doingwhat?", "There's only one planet in the Kurlan system capable ofsupporting life. Loren Three.", "Mister Data, set course for Loren Three, maximum warp.", "There is a good chance that our competition may be here beforeus. Battle stations, Mister Worf.", "On screen.", "On screen.", "I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise and I see no reason why I should answer to you. Cardassians have no claims in this sector.", "Not at all. But we are on a purely scientific mission. You haveno reason to interfere with us.", "I believe we all know why we're here. If weadmit that, then we can move forward.", "Look, if we try to deceive one other, then we shall getnowhere. I think we all know about Professor Galen's research, andabout the computer programme composed of fragments. I'll take yoursilence as confirmation. Now, it stands to reason that none of us hasthe DNA fragments necessary to complete the programme. You were thefirst to arrive in this system. Do you have an organic sample from theplanet below?", "I believe that one of you has a fragment from Indri Eight.", "He destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken thesample.", "We're all missing some of the fragments, not necessarily thesame ones. Unless we combine the ones we have, we will never learn thesecret of theprogramme.", "But until we assemble it, we will never know its purpose.", "Myriap! Enough. Without cooperation we will get nowhere.", "If you each bring your samples on board the Enterprise, I willcombine them with ours. And then we will all observe the resultssimultaneously, giving no one the advantage.", "Then this endeavour dies here, in this room.", "We may be very much closer indeed.", "This is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across thegalaxy. Doesn't it make it natural to assume that the originaldesigners of the puzzle should want us to find it? Why else would theyhave put the pieces in our DNA? And in turn, doesn't suggest they wouldtry to make it easy for us to find those pieces, that there might besome pattern to their distribution?", "Doctor, programme the computer to analyse the distribution ofthe pieces that we have, correcting for changes in star configurationsover four billion years, then extrapolate for the missing piece.", "If you wish, you can stay on board while we wait.", "What is it, Geordi?", "Report, Number One.", "Well, it won't take them long to realise that Rahm Izad is thewrong planet.

I was walking through an alley.", "Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why Istarted to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind.", "Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them.", "We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be allright", "Will, please.", "Number One, do you remember what happened? You were abductedduring the mission to Tilonus Four. You were put into a psychiatrichospital.", "It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions. We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you.", "What are you doing, Will?", "But what if it isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take thatchance?", "Evidently, you were abducted two days afterbeaming to the surface.", "We believe that they were trying to extract strategicinformation from your memory using a neurosomatic technique.", "You should get some rest. We can talk some more tomorrow.", "On screen. Open a channel.", "Congratulations, Doctor. This is an amazing achievement.", "Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear me? Please respond.", "Mister Worf, can you beam him out of there?", "Doctor Jo'Bril, listen to me. It is imperative that you turnthe shuttle. Take it out of the corona. Do you understand me? Pilot theshuttle away from the star.", "Mister Worf, get a lock on him as soon as you can.", "How's it going?", "Do you have any idea what it was?", "Were the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him?", "Beverly, the answers will come.", "You know, you've been at this for hours. You might think moreclearly if you got a good night's sleep.", "You're doing it for Doctor Reyga, or yourself?", "You're the loneliest person in the world right now. No one cansay anything, no one can do anything that will help. And you think thatit will never go away. And you're right, it won't. But you can get usedto it. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but you can.", "But by your own admission, Reyga was a difficult man tounderstand. Isn't it possible that he was simply masking his feelings?", "Do you have any evidence of that?", "Beverly. I'm afraid there will be no autopsy. The family hasalready been contacted. They insist that the body must not be toucheduntil they perform the Ferengi death ritual.", "To the family that's irrelevant.", "Please believe me, they're adamant. We are scheduled torendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will pick upReyga's body then. I'm sorry, there will be no autopsy.", "Then you will have to find evidence some way other than anautopsy.", "Come. Beverly.", "What did you find?", "You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that thefamily would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, butyou've interfered in the burial rituals of another culture. You've putboth of us in a very difficult position. The family will have to benotified. I don't doubt that they will react strongly. If the Ferengigovernment becomes involved, as I'm certain they will, this could havevery significant repercussions. I'm not sure how much I can protectyou.", "I'm not surprised.", "On screen.", "Open a hailing frequency.", "Doctor Crusher, what do you think you're doing?", "A theory?", "Return to the ship immediately.", "Mister Worf, override the shuttle's computer. Return it to theshuttlebay.", "Mister Data, what is her heading?", "Beverly, what do you hope to accomplish?", "But you can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on ahypothesis.", "Beverly, what's happening?", "All right, begin a phase one search, starting with theshuttlecraft's last known coordinates. Plot a proximity course towardthe star.", "On your feet, Lieutenant.", "Mister Worf, your personal affairs are strictly your ownconcern until they interfere with the operation of this ship. You havenow crossed that line. As your Captain, I want to know exactly what isgoing on.", "Try.", "Does this have something to do with the Klingons you rescuedfrom Carraya Four?", "Is that what you're doing here? Trying to recapture thosefeelings?", "It's a pity you didn't try using the holodeck instead ofsetting fire to your quarters.", "Have you lost your faith in Sto-Vo-Kor?", "Inexcusable. And understandable. It may be that what you arelooking for cannot be found here on the Enterprise. Perhaps you need toimmerse yourself in Klingon beliefs in order to discover whether theycan hold any truths for you. Is there something you can do, is theresomewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully?", "Boreth is only twelve days from here by shuttle. As of thismoment, Mister Worf, you are on leave.", "But when you set foot on this ship again, I expect you toperform your duties like a Starfleet officer.", "And, Mister Worf? I hope you find what you're looking for.", "Look, we have no reason to rule out anything. We are notordered to investigate the origins of our guest, nor tell anyone whatthey should believe. We are simply to transport Kahless to the HomeWorld. And while he's here with us, he will be treated as an honouredguest.", "Welcome aboard, Gowron.", "I assume that you're referring to Kahless.", "Well, the person in question is in his quarters at the moment.", "We haven't done any analysis.", "If you wanted to run tests on Kahless, you should have sent aKlingon ship for him.", "If he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worryabout.", "So Gowron has come on board in order totest your claim.", "He has brought a knife with him, a knife is was supposed to bestained with the blood of Kahless.", "He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood andon you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if youagree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available toensure that it is conducted impartially.", "Jean-Luc Picard. 2", "I hope you understand our need to verify your claim. 2", "Could there be some sort of cloning involved here?", "But it's not conclusive.", "But can't brain patterns be cloned?", "How can two grown men share the same childhood experiences? Itjust doesn't make any sense. 2", "Lieutenant, our Chief Engineer is checking the transport logsof the Potemkin. Perhaps that will shed some light on the matter. Don'tworry, we will get to the bottom of this. And in the meantime, you willbe taken to your quarters. Try and make yourself as comfortable aspossible. 2", "And another William Riker materialised there.", "But of course, as you and Lieutenant Riker have lived verydifferent lives for the past eight years, you are now very differentpeople. I suppose it's a little like meeting someone's twin. But nomatter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers onboard. And as Lieutenant Riker will be with us for several days, Ithink we should do everything we can to make him comfortable andwelcome.", "Can it be repaired, at least enough to access the database?", "Perhaps he can help us.", "He was alone down there for a long time. I'm hesitant to lethim go back until he's been evaluated.", "Thank you, Counsellor. 2", "Come.", "Yes, Number One. Come in.", "Lieutenant Riker has been to see me to talk about the awaymission. He believes that the only way to retrieve the database is bydirectly accessing the main core underneath the station.", "He said that he was down there recently. He seemed confidentthat it could be done safely.", "But if it doesn't work, we won't have another chance for eightyears.", "Given the importance of the data, I think that it's worth therisk.", "I'm sure that Lieutenant Riker will be happy to help you withthat.", "Well, it was little better at the physiognomy workshop. DoctorVassbinder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionisation effect ofwarp nacelles before he realised that the topic was supposed to bepsychology.", "There was no opportunity. There was no pause. He just kept talking in one long, incredibly unbroken sentence, movingfrom topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt. It wasreally quite hypnotic.", "How long did it appear to you that we were frozen?", "Let's go through all this again. You were sitting there. Therest of us were here. Describe the exact moment when we appeared tofreeze.", "Did you sense something from any of us at that time? Anyunusual emotion?", "Or there is another possibility, Counsellor. This could benothing more than simple", "Are you all right, Counsellor?", "It appears to be the same effect that you described in us. Doyou remember anything?", "How do you account for this discrepancy?", "Mister Data, contact the Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker tomeet us at the rendezvous point as soon as possible. Have him scan theregion for temporal anomalies.", "Are we within sensor range?", "Increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates.", "Report!", "Full stop. What happened?", "Is there a fuel containment leak?", "I'll check the fuel consumption logs.", "My hand.", "The pain is going away.", "It happened when I reached for the bowl of fruit.", "Check the hull integrity.", "Mister La Forge, see if you can move us away from thedisturbance.", "Yes, Mister La Forge?", "Can we navigate around these fragments?", "Get us to the Enterprise.", "Perhaps the Enterprise has been delayed.", "Take us to it.", "There she is.", "Mister Data?", "Scan for life signs.", "There's a second energy beam. It's coming from the Enterprisedeflector array. Do you have any idea what that could be?", "We're not going to be able to determine anything from here. Weneed to get on board the Enterprise.", "Well, we have to find some way of staying unfrozen. Mister LaForge, what about a subspace forcefield like the one we used on DevidiaTwo? Could something like that protect us from the effects of thetemporal fragment?", "Mister Data?", "Well, Mister La Forge, it would seem that time is something wehave plenty of.", "Beam us directly to the Enterprise Bridge.", "There are three Romulans, all of them with disruptors. One atconn. There are none of our security officers on the Bridge. They musthave taken us by surprise. It appears that we can move objects in thistime frame.", "I'm wary about making changes in this time continuum until weunderstand more about what's going on.", "Security teams had just been sent to transporter room three. And to Sickbay. Counsellor, will you go to Sickbay and investigate? Mister Data, go to main Engineering. See if you can determine the causeof that power surge. I'll be in transporter room three. Mister LaForge?", "Will you lock onto our signals. I want you to beam CounsellorTroi to", "Understood. We'll use the Jefferies tube. Let's go.", "No, we'll find an alternative route. Let's go back up.", "Excuse me, Mister Worf.", "Counsellor, take a look at this. It appears that Mister Worfhad just beamed these three on board, and according to this, threeother Romulans had been beamed directly to Sickbay just secondsearlier.", "What are we doing transporting Romulans on board the ship inthe middle of a battle? They don't have any weapons and that one looksinjured. If they were part of an invasion, then why are they unarmed? It doesn't make any sense.", "Go ahead, Mister Data.", "What's the problem, Mister Data?", "Expanding? I thought that time was suspended on this ship.", "Is there anything we can do to stop it?", "Astonishing to see it frozen like this.", "My head. Oh. Dizzy. I can't. No! No!", "Can we modify the subspace isolators to give us betterprotection?", "Very well. Well, the first step is to find out why theEnterprise was transferring power to the Romulan ship. I think we should begin our search in the Romulan engine room. Counsellor, you spent several days on a Romulan vessel. You probablyknow more about the layouts than anyone here. Perhaps", "Yes, very well. I will monitor your progress from here. Butjust remember, ten minutes, no more.", "When time resumed, did you observe any activity in the engineroom that might", "Suggest what the Romulans were doing?", "Mister La Forge", "From where you are, can you determinewhat's happening on the Romulan Bridge?", "Mister Data, you said that you found organic matter in thetemporal aperture.", "I'd like to take a closer look at those readings.", "They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns. Can youisolate one of them and magnify?", "They look like cellular clusters.", "Data, this could be some sort of embryo.", "Who are you?", "Who were in danger?", "How were your young trapped in the core?", "The Enterprise responded, and found the warbird suffering froman apparent engine failure, and they attempted a power transfer.", "Did you who attacked the Enterprise?", "Are there any others like you here?", "Do you know where he is? Could he help us restore normal time?", "Is it possible to lock onto the core itself, beam it intospace?", "Mister Data, when you scanned the temporal aperture with yourtricorder, it caused time to move forwards and then back again.", "What if we could reverse that process? Cause time movebackwards and then forwards.", "The breach never happens.", "Make it so. If this works, we may not have much time to preventthe power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely where to be and whatto do the very instant that time begins to move backwards. Captain's log, supplemental. After placing themodified tricorder on the Romulan ship, we have returned to theEnterprise.", "Acknowledged. Counsellor, are you in position?", "All right, Mister Data.", "Go ahead, Mister Data.", "Be ready to stop the power transfer, MisterData.", "No time to explain, Number One. Continue the evacuation of theRomulan ship. You'll find LaForge in the Romulan engine room. Beam himdirectly to Sickbay.", "Status, Mister Data?", "Can we move the ship?", "Patch me into the navigational control of the runabout.", "I'm bringing the runabout in.", "Mister Data?", "Data, it appears that severing the powertransfer has not only prevented the core breach, but has also restored", "Space-time to normal.", "The warbird has vanished as well.", "It's going to take a little time to explain, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 46945.3. We successfullyevacuated the crew of the Romulan ship, and we're on course to theNeutral Zone to bring them home.", "Ohniaka Three? There's no strategic value to that outpost. Werethey able to identify the attackers?", "Bring us out of warp, Ensign.", "Hail them, Mister Worf.", "Put them on screen.", "Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost?", "Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign! Return fire.", "Plot an intercept course, Ensign. Fire torpedoes.", "Take us back to Ohniaka Three.", "What?", "Did they show any interest in assimilating you or yourtechnology?", "The Borg's entire existence was centred around acquiringcultures and technology. If that's changed, then they must have a newobjective. We have to find out what it is. Mister Worf, from thismoment on, I want to maintain a level two security alert. Post armedofficers on every deck.", "Number One, I want you to analyse our sensor readings of theBorg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or analien ship which they captured. Then run an analysis of this subspacedistortion they used to escape.", "I'm going to contact Starfleet Command.", "Understood.", "I thought that I had made that clear.", "When Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began togrow and to evolve into something other than an automaton. He became aperson. When that happened, I felt I had no choice but to respect hisrights as an individual.", "No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am alsobound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. And Iwill not sacrifice them in order to", "Yes, sir.", "What's our ETA?", "Contact the Crazy Horse and the Agamemnon. Have them standingby in case we need them.", "Mister Worf, acknowledge the signal from New Berlin andtransmit another copy of Starfleet's ship-recognition protocols andtell them to read it this time.", "Come.", "An artificially created energy conduit? That could be anything.", "I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers! I'm sorry. Hewas in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortalthreat, and I let him go.", "It may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the rightthing to do.", "Doesn't it seem strange to you that there have been two Borgattacks and the Enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances?", "Take us out of warp near that ship.", "On screen.", "Lay in an intercept course, full impulse. Lock phasers.", "They're not going to get away with it this time. Picard toEngineering. Transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulseengines.", "Picard to Engineering, can we transfer auxiliary power to thewarp nacelles? Try to break us out by using the", "On screen.", "Is everyone else all right?", "They beamed aboard as a diversion to give their ship time toescape.", "Can you waken him?", "Do it.", "Lower the forcefield.", "What is your designation?", "Crosis? How did you get that name?", "Who is that?", "But you are Borg. Your goal is not to destroy but to assimilateus into the collective.", "Tell me more about this One. Does he have a name? Is he calledHugh?", "Why must this One destroy biological organisms?", "I am Locutus of Borg. You will respond to my questions. This isgoing nowhere. Doctor, I want an autopsy performed on the other one. Compare the differences with what we learned of Hugh's anatomy. See ifthere have been any recent modifications which might explain thesebehavioural differences. Data, run a biospectral analysis on this Borg. See if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others.", "How fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits?", "Is there any way for us to duplicate", "Who authorised a launch?", "Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify yourself and return to theship immediately. Mister Worf, lock on with a tractor beam and returnit to the ship.", "Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit?", "The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly?", "Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion has something to do withthis. It could have affected him more profoundly than we realise. Either way, we have to find him.", "Mister Worf, red alert.", "Bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft.", "Mister La Forge?", "Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse.", "Report.", "Can you locate the shuttle?", "Yes, Mister La Forge.", "The Borg have been busy.", "Lay in that course, Ensign, and engage at full impulse.", "Are they intentionally jamming our sensors?", "Can we transport through the interference?", "Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down to thosecoordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on yoursignals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble.", "Can you determine how long they've been gone from theshuttlecraft?", "Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they'restill together, how far could they have travelled in three hours?", "Picard to Riker.", "I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up acommand post and begin mapping out a search plan.", "Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low levelreconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay.", "And all available personnel, including you and me, will beginto put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew onboard the ship.", "If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space.", "Good luck, Captain.", "Who's manning the command post?", "Anything, Mister La Forge?", "What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might create a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells.", "Come on.", "Can you tell if it was built by the Borg?", "Well, it certainly hasn't been abandoned.", "It's a dampening field. This entire structure could be shieldedfrom our sensors. Let's go.", "Data?", "What?", "Lore.", "He was here in this room. I could have rid the Federation of amortal threat, and I let him go.", "If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship, but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space.", "Lore.", "I'm not particularly impressed. All you've done is teach themto enjoy killing.", "He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you.", "How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here?", "You're controlling him, and you've corrupted the Borg.", "I would like to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us.", "How about that, Data? He won't even let you talk.", "Data, do you remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Do youremember what you were like then?", "It does to me. I want to know what has happened to Data.", "Data, you must realise that something hashappened to you. The Data I know would never have agreed to be awilling party to Lore's plan.", "Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? Whatabout the lives that have already been lost?", "A carrier wave? Is that how he's manipulating Data?", "Can we reactivate it?", "And although Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions,at least Data might listen to us.", "Data, where are you taking him?", "Data, wait. Let us talk to you.", "See if the corridor is empty.", "What have you done to him?", "I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard'sinterlink system. I think that it uses some kind of phased-pulsetechnology. Do you think it could be modified to generate a kedionpulse that would reboot Data'sprogramme?", "All right, I think I've found it.", "Well, I've done everything that Geordisaid. Now to activate it.", "We'll only tell that when we see his behaviour.", "No, it's one programme among thousands. I just hope this forcefield has enough energy to trigger the pulse.", "You're killing him. He won't survive another session.", "Data, it's not too late. If you remove thefibres, then Geordi might yet recover.", "Why? Because Lore tells you so?", "Good? Data, isn't good and bad, right and wrong, a function ofyour ethicalprogramme?", "What does that programme tell you about what you're doing toGeordi? About what you and Lore are doing to the Borg? It tells youthat these things are wrong, doesn't it, Data? So how can actions thatare wrong lead to a greater good?", "No, you're not confused, Data. You're sensing the truth. Yourethical programmeis fighting the negative emotions that Lore is sending you.", "What about Geordi and Troi?", "Welcome back, Data.", "What will you do now?", "I'm not sure that's true.", "Good luck, Hugh.", "What's keeping them?", "Ah, you're just in time. They're about to disembark.", "Ambassador Loquel, Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome on board the Enterprise.", "It is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchangebetween the Iyaaran people and the Federation.", "How do you do. I'm looking forward very much to meeting withthe Premier of Iyar. There will be a reception held in your honour whenyou will meet the rest of my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on myway to your home world, but I shall be leaving you in the safe hands ofmy most experienced officers. Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire,is my head of Security. He will be in charge of your safety whileyou're on board. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will beyour personal liaison office, Ambassador Loquel.", "Ambassador Byleth, this is Commander William Riker, my FirstOffice, from the planet Earth. He has been assigned to you.", "Well, Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wideexperience in inter-species contact.", "Well, that will be just fine. Mister Worf?", "Good luck.", "So, I understand that your homeworld hassome of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Isthere any place in particular that you would recommend I visit whileI'm there?", "Well, I, er, what's our ETA?", "I think I'll go update my itinerary.", "What happened?", "What's the cause?", "There is an M-class planet in this system. Can we reach it?", "Inertial dampeners are offline. Life support is failing.", "Velocity dropping. Thermal shields at full power.", "Voval. Voval, try not to move. You may have a concussion. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise, do you read me? Too muchinterference.", "There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings abouttwo kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Doyou understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back assoon as I can.", "Is someone there? Who's there?", "What do you want? Who are you? Who are you?", "No, wait. Stop. There was someone else in the shuttlecraft withme. The pilot, he's injured. He needs your help.", "Hello. Smells good. Thank you. Thisis a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Are youone of the crew?", "How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you'recertainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What'syour name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer.", "Anna, are there other people on this planet? How long have youbeen here?", "What was the date when you crashed?", "Seven years!", "Anna, Anna. wait a minute.", "Anna, Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is alot of equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it tocontact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave.", "Yes. Both of us. Now, if you will help me to get to theshuttle. Ow.", "Don't worry, I won't move.", "Let them knit?", "Perhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment backhere.", "Good. Go into the cockpit, and look for a small comm. panel inthe instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here.", "Anna, why was this door locked from the outside?", "From what?", "Good.", "If we can boost the output field, I might be able to send adistress signal. Something seems to be wrong with it.", "This transmitter module has been totally destroyed. How couldthat happen? It looks as though it's been hit by a phaser blast.", "No.", "Anna, we will get out of here. It's not going to be easy, butwe need to work together.", "Anna, no matter how long it takes, we will get out of here.", "No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge thispower cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energyrelays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one morecharge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate theshuttlecraft's engines.", "That sounds delightful.", "Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder, I'm going totry to repair these energy relays.", "Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think thatyou are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathyfor what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don'tthink that you can really be in love with me.", "No, I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'mbringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that youcould possibly be just a little confused right now?", "I think that's a little premature. We hardly know anythingabout each other.", "No harm done. It's going to take at least a couple of hours tocharge this cell. Then as soon as it's done, we should get it over tothe shuttle immediately. This cell casing is already beginning to breakdown. Anna, we are going to get out of here.", "The power cell is ready. We should take itover to the shuttle.", "Why not?", "We don't have a few hours. I told you, this cell is alreadybeginning to degenerate.", "I'm feeling very much better. in fact, I don't intend to go onusing this any longer.", "There's no pain. It would appear I don't have any broken ribsafter all.", "What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here?", "Why are you keeping me locked in this freighter? You say thatthere are wild animals out there but I haven't heard or seen a singleone of them.", "What about that comm. panel? You said you damaged it when youwere cutting it out of the shuttle. Did you? You see, I find it hard tobelieve that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that couldget you out of here after seven years. And what was this really for? Tokeep me immobilised?", "So it was necessary to keep me captive?", "I'm going to go look for the shuttle myself.", "Anna!", "Anna, no!", "Anna, stop!", "Anna. Anna! Anna, where are you going?", "Yes! Inside here!", "Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! Over here! The door's over here!", "Voval! I thought you were dead.", "Yes. There's a woman living here. She told me that she'd beento the shuttle. She said that she saw you dead.", "I see.", "Yes.", "She was upset.", "It's possible.", "You stay here. Keep warm. I'll go and look for her.", "Anna! Anna!", "We can search it twice as fast if we separate.", "Anna! Anna!", "Anna, Anna.", "You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,he's still alive. He can help us get away from here.", "No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven'tyou?", "The necklace. It broke. I saw it in the cargo freighter, on thefloor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It'swhole. How?", "Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived momentsafter you left? That he insisted that I come here to look for you? ThatI find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? That's very good timing,don't you think?", "Are you and Voval working together? He's the only one who couldhave brought you the necklace.", "Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must betwo hundred metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But Idon't think that it really is.", "Failed? Voval, what is going on?", "Ambassador?", "But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you abetter understanding of love?", "And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, andthey fell in love.", "Let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach. Ambassador, I have tell you that in my culture, what you have donewould be considered a crime.", "Well, we'll can talk about it later. For now, I think we shouldget off this planet. Am I in assuming the damage the shuttle is not asbad as it seems?", "I think that now would be quite nice.", "For me as well, Ambassador.", "No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. Wehumans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never toomuch, never too little, and it's very nice to find a culture that iswilling to take an experience to its furthest extreme.", "Ambassador. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek \u00ae and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I would like to retrieve themand their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk.", "Doctor?", "Picard to Riker.", "We will proceed with the probe.", "How long before you have it in position?", "Acknowledged.", "Is there any indication what caused this hallucination?", "So you believe that what you saw was some kind of transmission?", "Granted, but how could he perceive his mother visually as ifshe were standing there in the room?", "Geordi, the Hera's last reported location was three hundredlight years away. How could it end up here?", "No, no, I'm sorry, Geordi. I'm not prepared to risk your life. Data, find another way of salvaging the Raman. I want an alternate planin two hours.", "Geordi, I'd like you to talk to Counsellor Troi. She'sexpecting you.", "Can we get the shuttles close enough without danger? Mister LaForge.", "Then in that case", "Commander.", "Why here?", "Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support thishypothesis?", "Mister Data, is any of this possible?", "How unlikely?", "let's proceed with the shuttle plan.", "Dismissed. Mister La Forge.", "I want you to know that I am not unsympathetic to what you'regoing through. Your mother's disappearance is tragic, but I cannot riskyour safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis.", "I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made.", "Commander La Forge.", "Stop your descent. Prepare to disengage theinterface.", "Damn it, Geordi, you're going to kill yourself.", "Doctor, report.", "Geordi, what's happening to you?", "Geordi?", "What's happening? Report.", "Is there any way that we can disconnect him?", "Reduce the input gradually, and still get him out before it'stoo late.", "Deceive them?", "Like a decompression tank? Let's try it.", "Explain.", "How do you know all this?", "Are these beingsPICARD", "Geordi, what's happening?", "Can we switch the input?", "Is it working?", "You disobeyed my direct order. You putyourself in grave danger. I am not happy.", "I will deal with Mister Data at another time. Meanwhile, I willhave to write this incident into your permanent record.", "Dismissed. Geordi? I'm very sorry that you didn't find yourmother.", "They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now.", "If he has nothing to give us, we should kill him now and bedone with it. Everyone seems to recognise that fact except you.", "He may not be as useful as you think, if this is the same Rikerthat I've heard about.", "Commander of the Enterprise formerly assigned to the Hood.", "Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history ofinsubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during theCardassian incident at Minos Korva.", "Look, I've been smuggling artefacts from Federation sites foryears. You can't help developing a familiarity with certain Starfleetpersonnel. If we hadn't have captured him, he'd probably have ended upbefore a court martial.", "Look, he's no use to us. Finish him now. Let me do it for you.", "The antimatter flow regulator is locked open.", "The flow regulator is frozen.", "We don't have much time. It's good to seeyou, Will. I didn't expect to meet you here.", "These mercenaries use weapons that can activate theirtransporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly, justby firing at them. That's what they did to me.", "The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of theartefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. Iwanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar onDessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me. They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation.", "I convinced them I was a smuggler, and that my name was Galen. I offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen. Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefactsfrom archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has meanalysing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will,they are looking for a specific artefact.", "That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. I think thathe knows more about what we're really looking for than anyone else onthis ship. I want you to get close to him. Try and get his confidence.", "He also believes that you're a less than perfect Starfleetofficer. Will, I want you to play into that role. Baran and I, well, hedoesn't care very much for me, but he has to tolerate me because heneeds my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies,then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends.", "Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk.", "What? Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site, youknow. It's a Federation outpost there.", "It's defended by Starfleet. You don't think they're just goingto stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want.", "They also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possiblyphoton torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about?", "Because I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of therenearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece.", "Why don't we use Riker? He's a Starfleet Commander. He couldtalk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions. Then when their shields go down, we can beam the artefacts up herewithout ever leaving the ship.", "If he doesn't help us, we'll have to destroy the outpost andkill everyone on it. He's still a Starfleet officer. He won't want totake innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it.", "Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number fourseven eight B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three.", "Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number three sixnine B.", "Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan.", "You can tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he cando it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait.", "I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of theidentification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person toanalyse these artefacts. Baran knows that.", "I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point ofthis mission were, why I was analysing these relics.", "Do you know what all this is about?", "Then what's going on here. Why are we risking our lives takingthese artefacts? Who wants them?", "You can tell Baran every word that I've said. He knows that Idon't think much of him as a leader.", "Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation.", "If someone were to challenge him, the rest of the crew wouldfollow.", "No, there's no time for that! Starfleet will be here anyminute.", "I'm configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse. If I can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency,I should be able to take it out with one shot. Firing. Their shieldsare down.", "They managed to get their shields back up.", "Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't havethat control device.", "They captured me to find out how much I knew about theiroperation.", "I convinced them I was a smuggler. Will, these are not commonthieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts from archeological sitesthroughout this sector.", "I've lost three plasma relays on the disruptors. Auxiliarypower is, is not available.", "What's wrong, Commander? You having second thoughts aboutbetraying your comrades? Because that's what you've done, betrayedthem. Betrayed them in order to save yourself. You used to be just asecond rate officer, now you're a traitor and a coward. How does thatfeel?", "You can tell Baran that I'm working as fast as I can. What?", "You were there. The disruptors lost power. Computer, reset fordiagnostic of new sample. Begin scan.", "Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan. Lookthis isn't a Romulan labour camp. I don't have to answer yourquestions. And I don't give a damn what you think.", "Well, whatever it is we're looking for, it seems we've foundit.", "I've had some unpleasant surprises. Will, this isn't a goodidea. Baran might grow suspicious.", "What a tangled web we weave. I have difficulty rememberingwhose side I'm on. So, what have you been able to find out?", "A second artefact? Oh, by the way, that first artefacts is notRomulan. It's Vulcan.", "I have been looking over the glyphs and pictograms from theCalder Two artefact. And although I don't have enough data to translateall the inscriptions, the alphabet and symbology is much moreconsistent with early Vulcan than Romulan.", "I don't know. If I could just get access to the Enterprisecomputer just for a few moments. So, what will Baran do once he'sobtained the second artefact?", "Will, you always seem to be after my job. Well, as soon asBaran feels that I've outlived my usefulness, he can kill me simply byusing the neural servo. So, I think we had better start planning amutiny.", "We need a new captain and I've come to one inescapableconclusion", "Oh?", "Then who will they follow? You?", "What?", "What are you talking about?", "Vulcan Security?", "What sort of threat?", "I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.", "That sounds like an illogical philosophy.", "Tell me, Tallera, what are these artefacts we've beencollecting? I know that they are Vulcan in origin.", "You were much as my people once were. Savage, warlike.", "The Stone of Gol!", "I know the story from Vulcan mythology.", "But according to the legend, the Stone was destroyed by thegods when the Vulcan people found the way to peace.", "A telepathic weapon.", "It would seem that Baran has to deliver these artefacts to theassassin in order to get paid. Therefore, you and I should continue ourmasquerade.", "How could they have found out about the rendezvous, Commander?", "Do you have any idea how many security officers there are onboard a ship like that?", "Oh, yes, very convenient. We beam you back aboard your old shipand we have to take a risk that you won't change your mind and betrayus.", "Agreed.", "Don't!", "It's not in here. Hey, you, where's the artefact?", "This is it.", "Yes, I can recognise the inscription pattern from the firstartefact.", "Is he dead?", "Good. Activate the transporter.", "I have something else for you, Baran.", "Tell him what happened, Narik.", "He might have killed all of us. And I believe he was actingunder direct orders, Baran. You betrayed us. This has gone far enough. I think it is time that we had a new commander. Someone who will leadus to those profits that we've been promised.", "Follow your orders? The orders of a small man trying to fill arole too big for him. I say it's time for a change. Who's with me?", "It's over, Baran.", "You can't kill all of us. You need us to run the ship more thanwe need you to command it.", "I switched the transponder codes. Given his feelings about me,it seemed a sensible thing to do.", "There'll be no more punishment on this ship. Now, do yourduties and I'll see to it that we complete our mission and get ourpayment.", "Maintain our present course and speed for now. I'm going tofind out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo.", "According to Baran's logs, we are todeliver the two pieces to the T'Karath Sanctuary on Vulcan.", "Galen to Bridge. Alter course for Vulcan.", "Oh, I wonder if you can possibly help me with something. I havebeen able to translate most of the writing on these two pieces For themost part, they're warnings of death and destruction to anyone whoopposes the resonator, but I am not able to determine what appears onthe anterior side. For example, this symbol represents the Vulcan godof war and this is the god of death, but if you look really carefully,you can see a third symbol missing. Now that obviously should belong tothe final piece. Now what's odd about this is that the gods of deathand war would typically always stand alone on an artefact. They wouldnever be combined with a third glyph.", "I'm really anxious to see the final artefact, because it mightprovide a valuable insight into Vulcan mythology.", "Well there should be no problem about our entering orbit. Iasked Commander Riker to contact the Vulcan authorities from theEnterprise and let them know that we were approaching.", "Well, I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding. Someone mighthave mistaken this for an actual raid.", "Perhaps I should contact the Enterprise, have them meet us atVulcan just in case these isolationists try to escape.", "I see. Do you think it's wise for you to go there alone? Afterall, they were expecting Baran to show up. Don't you think if I were to accompany you, it might seem moreplausible.", "Of course.", "Tallera, I've decided on a change of plan. Take one of theartefacts with you. Leave the other here. As soon as we have ourpayment in full, we'll complete the delivery.", "I realise that. But it's safer for all concerned to leave onebehind.", "They've been waiting a long time for this. They're not going totake any risks. Now, take one of the artefacts and beam down.", "Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that thoseartefacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you down on the surface. As soon as she'sgot those artefacts, she'll leave you behind to be captured byStarfleet.", "You'll never get away with this. Starfleet will never stand andwatch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the Federation.", "Listen to me, all of you! Drop your weapons! Do it! Don't makeany aggressive movements. The resonatoramplifies violent feelings and emotions. And that's why you wanted meto pick up the phaser. That's how you were able to kill Narik andVekor. But I can see the symbol on that third artefact, and it is theVulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death. It's a warning that the power of the resonator can be overcome bypeace.", "Empty your minds of violent thoughts.", "Think, Tallera. Two thousand years ago your people were beingconsumed by war. But when peace came to Vulcan, the resonator becameuseless. That's why it was dismantled.", "You were right, Tallera. The resonator cannot be stopped byphasers and shields, but it can be defeated by peace. Captain's log, stardate 47169.2. Security MinisterSatok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest ofthe isolationists.", "Satok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed.", "Normally, I would be the first one to agree, but perhaps somethings best left in the past.", "Oh, they will be detained by the Vulcan authorities for themoment. But they're also facing charges from the Klingons, theCardassians, the Ferengi, and at least seven other worlds. Idon't think we'll be hearing from them for a while. Number One, willyou set course for Starbase two twenty seven. I'll join you on theBridge shortly.", "That's quite right. And as I'm supposed to be dead, I'll go andget some sleep. And, Mister Data, I suggest that you escort CommanderRiker to the brig.", "I just got a message from Starfleet command.", "You could say that. I've been invited to the annual StarfleetAdmiral's banquet.", "I've managed to avoid it for the past six years, but now itwould seem my luck has run out. I can't think of anything more tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation, uninterestingfood, boring speeches.", "After six years, Number One, I don't think I have any excusesleft.", "Bridge to Commander La Forge. What's our status?", "Acknowledged. Ensign Gates, set course for Starbase twonineteen, warp six. Engage.", "Engage. Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, why isn't myship", "Moving?", "Very well. Ensign Gates?", "Mister La Forge?", "On screen.", "Admiral.", "Actually, we have been experiencing a few minor difficultieswith our new warp core, but my Chief Engineer assures me that we willbe under way within the hour.", "No, no, certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it.", "Go ahead, Geordi.", "Ensign Gates, set a course and engage.", "Engineering, report.", "Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase two nineteen. AdviseAdmiral Nakamura I'll be a little later than I thought.", "Admiral, I can explain.", "Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems. Atthe moment, we are adrift.", "That will not be necessary. I have full confidence in myEngineering staff. I will be at the banquet on time. Picard out.", "Have you tried reconfiguring the plasmaconduits?", "What about the relays? Are you absolutely certain you don'tneed a new phase invertor?", "I see. Oh, perhaps I could reconfigure these isolinear chips.", "Oh, no, not at all. I'd be delighted.", "And what you saw was some sort of a mouth on Troi's shoulder?", "A straw?", "Mister La Forge?", "Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I'll have to relieveyou of duty and confine you to your quarters.", "What is it?", "All right. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms?", "What about Mister Data? There must be some connection betweenhis odd behaviour and these creatures. Is he infested as well?", "Data attacked Counsellor Troi because he saw a mouth on hershoulder. And in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms.", "Then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at MisterData's dreams.", "Perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpretingthe symbols and images of your dreams.", "Exactly. How soon can you have the link ready?", "Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I suggest that youshould prepare for bed.", "Ready, Mister Data?", "Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams, but in this case,bad dreams would be more helpful.", "Let's be very observant. Even the mostinsignificant image could be a very important symbol.", "Here he comes.", "Can we speak to Data directly or would that wake him up?", "You know, that sounds like a telephone ringer, but I don't seea receiver.", "Oh. Er, thank you. Look at that. Her right shoulder. That isthe same place that Data stabbed her.", "They're both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mister Data,what kind of cake is this?", "What could the ringing symbolise? A bell? Sound? Anold-fashioned way of communicating?", "Picard.", "Kill who?", "Who is this?", "You mean the interphasic organisms.", "Tell me, Doctor, how do we kill them?", "What do they represent?", "Respond? Respond to them? What does that mean?", "Who are you?", "Data, the shrieking noise you made. It causes them pain.", "Data, what's going on?", "What about the shrieking noises that you made?", "When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain.", "Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're going to be sweeping the shipwith a high frequency IP pulse. Will you monitor the creatures for anyresponse?", "How long before we have warp power again?", "Six hour? The banquet will be completely over by then. That'svery unfortunate.", "No, no, no. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the safety of theship.", "It must have been.", "I can imagine.", "Really?", "I'd be happy to.", "Is there a physiological cause?", "Yet her neural activity is practically non-existent.", "Might there be some side effect of Cairn telepathy of whichwe're unaware?", "I think it's time that you and I had a talk with Maques.", "Maques, is it possible that your telepathic communications withMrs Troi harmed her in some way?", "Counsellor? Stop it!", "Is Maques suggesting that your mother's metaconscious has beensomehow damaged?", "Maques, what were you doing in Sickbay?", "Was he trying to contact her telepathically?", "And if you succeed, can you use that information to help yourmother?", "If her psyche has collapsed in on itself, could accessing hermind pose any danger to you?", "Counsellor? Can you hear me?", "Deanna, Doctor Crusher's become concerned that yourparacortical readings have become erratic.", "Yes. I want you to sever your connection to your mother.", "I'm asking you. That is an order, Counsellor.", "Leave me alone, please.", "Could this event have involved Hedril?", "A part that she's protecting. You said that everything youencountered when you were in her mind was a barrier of one kind oranother.", "Counsellor.", "I've just come from Sickbay. Doctor Crusher feels that yourmother's condition is worsening. Her neural foundations are gettingweaker. Have you had any luck here?", "Is this your Father?", "He had a kind face.", "Deanna, your mother might still come out of this.", "You said you'd reviewed her journals for the past five years. Maybe we should go further back.", "Then let's start at the beginning. The first entry seems to bestardate 30620.1.", "That's odd. There's a seven year gap.", "And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth.", "She didn't. The files were deleted, by your mother, almostthirty years ago.", "No. I'm really sorry. I don't.", "You have? I'm really sorry.", "Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half of theirplanet to the Federation while leaving the other half out.", "Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, andthat unity said something about them. That they had resolved certainsocial and political differences and they were now ready to become parta larger community.", "But the Prytt are not. They are reclusive to the point ofxenophobia.", "That analogy is not exactly", "Go ahead, Number One.", "Inform him we're on our way. Thank you forbreakfast.", "Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf.", "Energise.", "Beverly. Beverly.", "I don't know.", "I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind ofprison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that AmbassadorMauric would have any reason to detain us.", "What is it?", "What?", "Some kind of coercive device?", "What is going on here?", "Prisoners on whose authority?", "Enemy? You mean the Kes.", "Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter intoany", "And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth.", "What?", "You're staring at me.", "There may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape.", "Beverly, the important thing during any confinement is to thinkpositively and not give up hope. There is a way out of every box, thereis a solution to every puzzle. It's just a matter of finding it.", "Damn.", "It means they plan on keeping us here for a while.", "Does it work?", "It's a map.", "Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap.", "Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door?", "There must be a lava flow or a underground hot spring somewherenear here.", "Can we get through it?", "What did you say?", "Say when.", "The eruptions have stopped.", "There's no way out of here.", "What?", "I didn't say anything about being thirsty.", "I was thinking about it, but I didn't say anything.", "The transceivers. Lorin said that they would align themselvesto our psi-wave patterns.", "I don't know.", "Well, right now we have more immediate concerns. Does your mapshow us a way out of here?", "Right.", "I heard that. They were not words exactly. A sudden sense offear. A sense of fear of heights.", "It was a strange sensation. Suddenly having these thoughtsappear in my mind.", "Come on, you've done this before. It's just like on a holodeck. One step at a time, just climbing steadily and slowly.", "One of us is hungry.", "Do you mind thinking of something else. You're making mehungry.", "Something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup.", "Beverly!", "I am not being unreasonable.", "You're right. We can't react to every random thought thatcrosses the other person's mind. Isn't astonishing, though, how muchclutter there is in a consciousness. Odd memories coming to thesurface. Bitsof half-remembered songs.", "I just wanted to see if you were still listening.", "Maybe if we put some distance between us, that might weaken it. Not that I'm growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts.", "What happened?", "Me, too.", "The same thing. But when you moved back toward me it gotbetter. Well, it seems as if we're stuck with each other.", "What is it?", "Let me see. This way.", "What?", "No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain togive the appearance of confidence.", "I'm beginning to realise that you seem to always have someacerbic remark on the tip of your tongue.", "Your friends. There was someone called Tom Norris?", "There's something more. You're laughing, but actually you'reembarrassed by that incident.", "This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling.", "No. It's several kilometres to find another way around thatridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's aforcefield protecting it, but we can find some way to deal with thatwhen we get there. Come on.", "No luck?", "Well, by this time tomorrow we could be back on the Enterpriseand you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife andfork.", "That's not true.", "That's not quite what I meant.", "It's just that I don't like", "You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal andrecently you've been ordering these elaborate things.", "I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaboratemeals either.", "There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It'salways seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow.", "Didn't you?", "You were married to my best friend. At first I thought it washarmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional.", "I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. Butalthough I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt.", "I felt guilty before he died> Having feelings like thatfor my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, Ipromised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It wouldbe like betraying my friend", "I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, Irealised that I didn't have those feelings any more. Twenty years is,after all, a long time.", "Yes, friends.", "Right.", "I'm all right.", "No, no. The modulation frequency is in the upper harmonicrange.", "They're coming.", "I tend to agree, Number One.", "Of course. Of course. You're absolutely right.", "My pleasure.", "So, were you getting tired of my company?", "To freedom.", "I was just thinking that as distracting as it was, I wasbeginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and I find that I missit.", "Oh?", "A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does whilehe's asleep.", "So now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do?", "You know exactly what I mean.", "Now that we know how each of us feels, perhaps we should not beafraid to explore those feelings.", "Goodnight. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek \u00ae and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Perhaps we can findsomething that will give us a more positive identification. Helm, takeus through the debris field, ahead slow.", "Shields up! Full reverse. Now!", "Damage report.", "On screen.", "Can we get more power to the shields?", "You have made a very serious accusation. Iwant you to explain it.", "If you wanted us to review your research, you should have madea request through the Science Council.", "Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take torestore the engines?", "Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listento your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is therecovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore ourengines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. Ifyou do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to thenearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done.", "We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, evenunder these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering. Get the core back online.", "Mister Data, I want you to review their research. I'd like yourreport as soon as possible.", "It's like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet. Eventually you wear it out.", "Can this theory be proven?", "Go ahead, Number One.", "What's their condition?", "Very well.", "We'll be underway as soon as our enginesare online.", "I would like you all to put together a research proposal forthe Science Council. I'll give it my full recommendation.", "Very good. Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming.", "Doctor, what is going on?", "Mister Worf, open a channel.", "Report!", "Mister Data, what's your analysis?", "Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she still in one piece?", "Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor. I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now.", "Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming?", "What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there?", "I want some better options. Data, Geordi, take Doctor Rabal andbegin an analysis of the rift. We need to find some way to get theFleming out of there. Second Officer's log, stardate 47312.1.

Can we establish communication?", "How long until we reach transporter range?", "Report.", "A distortion wave.", "Is everyone off the Fleming?", "All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here.", "Engage deflector shield.

You know, Geordi, I spent the better part of my lifeexploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of newspecies. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves.

Maybe it would be easierfor her if she learned the truth from you.", "It's a difficult choice. You must do what you think best, Data. But whatever decision you make, we will support it.", "So, how old are you, Mister Worf?", "I wouldn't miss this for the world. How oldare you?", "Report.", "Where is the information being sent now?", "Make it so.", "They're responsible for new starship development.", "Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region.

We use it for gathering dataon astronomical phenomena.", "Certainly not.", "What are you saying?", "The imaging logs? Are you suggesting that you have evidence theCardassians have tampered with the Array?", "I haven't heard anything about this.", "Mister Worf, are you feeling all right?", "Mister Data, perhaps you had better re-examine the Array. Seeif you can find any evidence to support Mister Worf's claims.", "Now, Mister Worf! Now!", "Number One.", "Ensign, take us out of here, maximum warp.", "Are they pursuing us?", "Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's your status?", "Acknowledged. Ensign, lay in a course to Starbase one two nine.", "What happened back there, Lieutenant?", "Granted.", "Captain, it would that we have found thequantum signature you are looking for.", "Our Data has said the same thing.", "We're launching it now.", "Enterprise here.", "Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem?", "How was the Bat'leth tournament?", "I don't know why we have to do this every year. I thought thatlast year the teachers had agreed that they wouldn't do this anymore.", "Why does it have to be me?", "Well, they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression ofme.", "Isn't there something else you have to do?", "Put it through, Mister Worf. Excuse me, Counsellor.", "Yes, Admiral?", "We are conducting energy output studies of the Mekoria Quasar. All systems normal. The ship is fully operational.", "I understand.

Mister Data?", "As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported onboard at Farpoint Station.", "I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates andWill's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statisticsand glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I wasabout to put it aside and look at another file and then somethingcaught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will wasFirst Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam downduring a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a generalcourt martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knewthat I had found my Number One.", "I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was moreconcerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the missionthan with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of themarks of a good officer.", "I am aware of that, Admiral.", "Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bitvague from the moment just before you abandoned ship. Is there anythingthat you can add to the official account?", "Put the asteroid on the main viewscreen.", "Mister Data, how long will it take to determine the exactlocation of the Pegasus?", "Mister Data, would it possible to saturate the asteroid withverteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and preventthe Romulans from detecting it?", "Mister Data?", "Make it so, Mister Data.", "When he's finished we'll have to move away and make it looklike we've scanned the asteroid but haven't find anything.", "If it works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can returnlater.

Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard Pegasus. Basedon testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, theJudge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude thatcertain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just priorto the destruction of the Pegasus. Mutiny on a Federation starship? That's shocking. It's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it.", "You know, it wasn't easy to get this record. I had to pull inquite a few favours at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seemsthat it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was thePegasus carrying sensitive equipment whichmust be allowed to fall into Romulan hands, not only was there amysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't, butit seems there was a mutiny on board. Now, I've read the officialreport of the inquiry on that mutiny, but I want to know your versionof what happened.", "Why?", "And you?", "The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officersare deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry. Further investigation is recommended. Will, there was no furtherinvestigation. This report was classified and then it was quietlyburied. Why?", "I'm taking this up with you, Will! The Judge Advocate thoughtyou were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Now, whatthe hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why isPressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later?", "Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force youto disobey his orders. Therefore I will have to remain in the dark onthis mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not letPressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that thattrust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the commandstructure of this ship. Dismissed.", "Margaret, something's very wrong here. Do you know what's goingon?", "On my way.", "Mister Worf, where are the Romulans?", "Take us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and holdthat position.", "Mister Data, report.", "Agreed.

You can charge me withinsubordination if you wish, but I'm not going to risk the Enterprisefor a salvage operation.", "If we begin a power transfer, can we restore life supportsystems to that compartment?", "Admiral, I would like to send down a complete away team", "Yes, sir.", "Picard to away team.

They've sealed us in.", "On screen.", "Are you responsible for this?", "What do you want, Sirol?", "How?", "Thank you for your generous offer. I will take it underadvisement.", "Agreed. Options?", "That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty ofAlgeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloakingtechnology.", "That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as aStarfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it.", "How do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid?", "I see why you were so eager to find it.", "Except it's illegal. It's in violation of an agreement that theFederation signed in good faith.", "Mister Data?", "Make it so. Captain's log, stardate 47457.1. We have beentrapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Data andCommander La Forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage thecloak.", "Proceed, Number One.", "Report.", "Take us out.

Carry out my orders.", "Mister Worf, send a message to the warbird. Inform them thattheir government will be contacted shortly about this incident.", "Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treatyof Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf?", "You're going to need them.", "I've spoken to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a fullinquiry once we reach Starbase two four seven, and that will probablylead to a general court martial of Admiral Pressman and several othersat Starfleet Intelligence. Your involvement in this affair is going tobe thoroughly investigated, Will. There'll be some hard questions foryou to answer.", "You made a mistake twelve years ago, but your service sincethen has earned you a great deal of respect, but this incident may costyou some of that respect.", "When the moment came to make a decision, you made the rightone.

You have left us with a colonyof Boraalans who think they're still on their planet.", "A home which would look very different from Boraal. You can'treally believe that they'll be fooled.", "What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware thatsomething strange is going on?", "I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that wehave another option. Very well, let's give it a try.", "Even then there's no guarantee that we'll find a suitableplanet.", "What is it?", "Why not?", "There's no way round it?", "That will take hours.", "Very well. Let's try it. Mister La Forge, I want you to monitorthe situation very carefully, and keep an open comm. link with theHolodeck so as to be apprised of any problems.", "Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't thinkit's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf willaccompany you.", "Mister Worf, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need tointroduce them to anyone new.", "Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making thissituation worse than it is.", "Picard here.", "Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca Six.", "I see. How is he?", "Does he understand the situation?", "Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on.", "Vorin, isn't it?", "Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We tookyou away from it.", "We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,like the caves on your planet.

We cantake you to one where you can build a new life.", "A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow.", "Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transportthe Boraalans?", "We'll have the transporter room standingby. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready ornot. Please keep Mister Worf apprised.", "You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problemto worry about.", "We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have youmade a decision?", "I see. What do you intend to tell them?", "If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believeyou?", "Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, orthat you're insane.", "On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. Theywould learn about alien worlds, starships.", "Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us.", "He said that he had nowhere to go.", "But he wouldn't have died alone and afraid.", "No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But Iwish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. Iwould have liked the chance to have known him better.", "A few more hours. Why?", "Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, butwe could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time.", "I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressiveaccomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands.", "Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scotsyourself. What was it that drew you here?", "It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorouslibidos.", "Thirties?", "Well it looks like we're going to be on Caldos for a few daysmore.

That it's because of him that she's staying?", "This is a rash decision, ill considered. It's not like Beverlyat all.", "Come.", "Where?", "Data, I want you to go down to the cemetery. See if you canpinpoint the source.", "In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin.", "Beverly?", "Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. Thedoor was open. I hope you don't mind.", "Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend, Ronin.", "Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm reallyanxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,but two of the Howard women.", "Have you changed the colour of your eyes?", "I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. Ithink I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly.", "Oh, no, there's something's wrong here. Now, Beverly, this ismore than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand. Tellme, why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you?", "So, you're Ronin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where are youfrom?", "How long have you been on Caldos?", "Go ahead, Data.", "Why not? What are you afraid of?", "Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out.", "Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are. He'll probably have the same questions that I do. How did you get here? What ship did you come on?", "Why don't you answer my questions? What ship? I'd like to lookat the passenger list. Where have you been living here? What's yourposition? Who are your neighbours?", "Come on, Beverly, we've got to get out of here.", "I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery.", "Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp.", "I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss itin the Observation lounge.

You are a certified pilot, Ensign?", "How long have you served on board theEnterprise, Ensign?", "I see I understand that you've been recommended for the Opsposition. Do you think you're up to it?", "I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record.", "The incident that you wereinvolved in at the Academy.", "It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you dosomething like that again?", "A dare devil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concernsme is that you participated in acover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of acadet.", "Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with theothers to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you thinkthat tells me about your character?", "Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at theAcademy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelledfor what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on boardthis ship. You're dismissed.", "If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't thinkyou'll find one.", "Please do.", "Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here andface me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you herebecause I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position.", "I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a veryimportant mission. A mission that could put you in a situation thatwould be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commandingofficer.", "Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh ninehundred hours. We'll discuss it then.", "And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. Iasked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance toredeem yourself.", "Please, take a seat, Ensign.", "This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved. He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative. He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information aboutCardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very wellenhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector. Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back toCardassian space.", "Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put youinto an escape pod and return you back across the border.", "We'll be waiting here to pick you up.", "Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm notordering you to take part in it.", "Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusherwill explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss thismission with anyone.", "Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready.", "To all Starfleet personnel, this is theCaptain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew,Ensign Sito Jaxa", "Has been lost", "In the line of duty. She was thefinest example of a Starfleet", "Officer, and a young woman ofremarkable courage", "And strength of character. Her loss will bedeeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out.", "What's the last thing you remember?", "Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findingswith the Federation Astrophysical Survey.", "What was that?", "Very well, Mister Worf. Fire.", "Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship?", "There are no technologically advanced cultures in that systemnow. But perhaps eighty seven million years ago, there were.", "Possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as ittravelled through space.", "But the question remains, why? What is its purpose?", "Why do you say that, Mister Data?", "Data, do you believe that you're in communication with thatobject?", "Very well. Mister LaForge, give him a hand.", "Yes, it's possible. But if that is an archive from some ancientcivilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful. Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in anydanger, I want you to sever the connection immediately.", "Come.", "Yes, come in, Number One.", "Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advancedtechnological society could have built that object out there. Theseartefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think.", "Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of mostenormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much morethan simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this?", "Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance.", "The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quitecommon in many different cultures.", "Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbolbelong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling apath, crossing a boundary.", "The ultimate boundary.", "I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominentlydisplayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others.", "I have no idea.", "What is it you want?", "Are you Masaka?", "What have you done to Commander Data?", "Yes.", "Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineeringimmediately.", "Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive ofyour species?", "Are there others like you there?", "Who is Masaka?", "I would like to know Masaka, speak with her.", "We should confine him to quarters.", "Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive. See if youcan find some way to access it. And in the meantime, I'll see what Ican learn from these people inside Data.", "I'm not going to hurt you.", "I need to speak with Ihat. Do you understand? Ihat.", "Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka. He seemedeager for his fate.", "Then Masaka is your queen?", "Then should we try to keep her asleep?", "Where is he?", "What's wrong?", "Of what?", "Masaka?", "Picard to Bridge.", "Report.", "I'll be right there.", "I won't leave you. Please, let go of me.", "Yes.", "I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolisedby a sun.", "According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death.", "There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small andinsignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought.", "Into living plants? How is that possible?", "I don't think we have a choice. We must destroy that archive. Mister Worf?", "Make it so.", "There's so much here we could have learned. I really regretlosing that opportunity.", "So, what's our status?", "So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elementsof its own culture.", "Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm notgoing to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister LaForge, do you have any ideas?", "That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, withMasaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her.", "Hello.", "Tell me about Masaka.", "Tell me, how can I talk to her?", "Korgano? Who is that?", "Ihat.", "Masaka is taking over my ship.", "I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is theonly one who can do that.", "An old man. Masaka's father.", "How can I find Korgano?", "Where has he gone?", "Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me. Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you.", "Very well. What do we do.", "Very well. How do I do that?", "Give me the sign.", "Ihat, the sign, give it to me.", "Yes.", "Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you.", "I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka'stemple.", "A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as theunending horizon. A curve", "Thank you.", "Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them?", "Any progress, Mister La Forge?", "Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple?", "Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killedhim for doing it. I think we have to risk it.", "Commander Riker, we're ready.", "This would seem that this is Masaka'stemple.", "Ihat said that if we created the temple, then it would get herattention. It may be some time before she shows herself.", "I don't know.", "This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. Thatcould be significant. Look, there it is again, and again. And thereagain. This is obviously an important pairing. He isn't chasing heranymore.", "Ihat said that someone named Korgano isn't chasing Masakaanymore. And the old man said, he pursues her no longer. In a sense,this small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka.", "That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and theold man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into theirbelief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure. It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, aconsort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbolanywhere else.]TROI", "Maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is morelike the sun and the moon.", "Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in acontinuous cycle.", "If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, thenperhaps he could force Masaka to leave.", "Ihat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano.", "Masaka.", "Masaka, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation", "Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying", "Then we will have to find someone too whom she will listen.", "All right, Mister La Forge, I want you to access thetransformation programme. And when you're ready, input the symbol.", "In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbolrepresents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyonehas a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it.", "Initiate the transformation.", "You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. Thisis a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps weshould try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehowincorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen tome.", "I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between thisculture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going toimprovise. Mister Worf, what's our status?", "Masaka.", "Are you surprised to see me?", "You should know that is impossible.", "Do you want to be the prey forever?", "But without me you are not complete. I know you so well. Youlive for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter,pursuing me, forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again?", "I think that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult,brightening the sky forever.", "So that you can wake with the dawn and begin the hunt again.", "As am I.", "Acknowledged, Number One. Mister Data, are you all right?", "I'm afraid that will take some time to explain. Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forgehas managed to disable the alien transformationprogramme. Starfleet hasdispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further.", "But I don't understand. I thought all the alien artefacts haddisappeared from the Enterprise.", "A memento.", "I can imagine. Doctor Crusher told me that there were possiblydozens of personalities inside you.", "Well, Data, you never may become fully human, but you've had anexperience that transcends the human condition.

Can you tell if she'sinside?", "Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready.", "The environmental settings in these quarters have been altered. Data, over here.", "Deanna.", "What's happened to her?", "What is she?", "She has been injured.", "Are you saying she's been bitten?", "First we've got to get the ship under control. Let's go to theBridge.", "It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal.", "Has his been changed as well?", "So the entire ship has been affected.", "I've regained attitude control for the ship, but main power isstill offline. It looks as though the entire power transfer grid hasbeen destroyed.", "Will?", "Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can youunderstand what it is that", "He looks almost proto-human.", "This tranquilliser should keep himunconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out?", "Introns?", "So these introns are causing her to re-combine in anearlier configuration?", "And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into whatappears to be one of the earlier hominids.", "What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth?", "How long before I begin to change?", "And what will that be\u00a0", "Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking forbreakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse theprocess?", "Agreed.", "They sound hungry.", "It would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoidlifeforms.", "What is it?", "So Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time thatshe was changing into a reptilian lifeform.", "If I remember my biology, there are several natural immunesystems that come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetusfrom viral infections.", "Maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using thenatural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid.", "Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid.", "Where is she?", "The Arboretum.", "I'm going to check the status of the warp core.", "Data!", "What was that?", "A spider?", "I have these intense feelings of fear and panic. I feel as if Iwere being watched. I can't explain it.", "In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry.", "How soon can you do that?", "What was that?", "Worf.", "Set your phaser to heavy stun.", "Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really, reallyaggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding tosome predatory instinct? Do you think he see us as prey?", "Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frightenother predators and to mark territory, and to commence mating process. A mating process. Counsellor Troi was bitten by a Klingon but not in aplace that might be life-threatening. Nowhere near a major artery ororgan. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was neverintended to give her any kind of serious harm.", "Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate?", "Well, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and protecther. And we have to keep on working on the retrovirus. If we coulddistract him, if we could lure him away from her.", "Klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell. If we couldduplicate Deanna's pheromones and then convince him she's no longer inSickbay, that she'd gone into some other part of the ship.", "Can you amplify the pheromones? They need to be much morepowerful than Deanna's actual scent.", "No, no, no. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go.", "No time. No time to argue.", "Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen!", "Go ahead, Data.", "Acknowledged.", "Yes, I'm", "Fine, Mister Data. Proceed. Well, Mister Worf, let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man. Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data hassucceeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher hasdetermined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay'sUrodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship.", "Good.", "I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral. There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past.", "Well, I am trying to get things off on a better note this time. I want to make her feel at ease. I want her to feel that she's welcomeaboard the Enterprise.", "We don't have to like her, Will, but we have to follow herorders, and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves nopurpose.", "Admiral Necheyev, welcome aboard the Enterprise.", "May I offer you some refreshment?", "As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide,Commander Wrightwell, and he said that you were particularly fond ofthem.", "Please. You were saying about the Cardassians?", "I see.", "This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassianterritory and some Cardassian colonies in ours.", "Well, the colonists are not going to be happy about that. Someof them have been there for decades.", "Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North AmericanIndians settled?", "Admiral, centuries ago these North American Indians wereforcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers on DorvanFive originally left Earth more than two hundred years ago in order topreserve their cultural identities.", "You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historicalparallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homesbecause of a political decision that has been taken by a distantgovernment.", "Granted, but to go to them now after twenty years later and askthem to leave what is now their home.", "What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated?", "That will not be necessary, Admiral.", "I understand.", "You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral.", "Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about thisplanet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet.", "I understand and I respect your people's long journey, but Ibelieve that I can help you to find a new home.", "And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'llfind you other choices.", "This is not true. I have the deepest deal of respect for yourbeliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people.", "And in the meantime, I would like to invite you all to join usthis evening on the Enterprise.", "I have been fascinated looking into thehistory and traditions of your people, and I was very interested tolearn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led thegroup of Indians from Earth initially more than two hundred years ago.", "It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that certainsacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfatherunderstood.", "Well, a great deal actually. My father was a strong believer inpassing on the traditions and history of the family.", "I hope that by the end of this matter, you will no longer lookat me as an adversary. My family. Well, our roots in Western Europe goback to the time of Charlemagne.", "But in a sense, that's exactly what happened. Wesley left theEnterprise three years ago he was a boy, and now he's returned a youngman. And that can't be easy for a mother or a son.", "Yes, I heard about the incident with Geordi.", "I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now.", "Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then anyefforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to workthis out for himself.", "Anthwara, I deeply regret that we have notbeen able to reach an agreement. But, and I must be blunt, I cannottake no for an answer. This planet will be handed over to theCardassian government in accordance with the terms of the borderagreement. I am very sorry, but you will have to leave.", "Then I will be forced to remove you by whatever means arenecessary.", "I may regret doing it, but I am not able", "I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, andthis happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it canhave", "Mister Worf, what is going on?", "I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.", "May I have a word with you, alone?", "It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassianpresence here for another six weeks. Your arrival here may have upsetsome very delicate negotiations.", "I would be very happy to explain that to you, but for now Imust ask you and your men to leave immediately.", "Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this isFederation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these peopleare under my jurisdiction and I will protect them.", "It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey.", "Admiral, the Indian Councils is adamant. They refuse to leave Dorvan Five.", "No, sir.", "Admiral, I have every reason to believe that they will resistany attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergencysession of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must bereopened.", "Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of oneof my ancestors against his people.", "No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see howit can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't helpwondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to berepeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannotforesee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for amoment?", "Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove theinhabitants from Dorvan Five.", "Inexcusable. You defied the orders of theranking officer on the scene. You put the lives of the entire away teamin jeopardy, and you made an already tense situation worse. Youractions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform. Now, Iwant an explanation, Mister Crusher, and I want it now.", "That does not alter the fact that my orders are to", "That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know whathas got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I willtell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every orderyou're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules ofconduct. Is that clear?", "Go ahead, Number One.", "Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here.", "Stand by, Mister Worf. Have your ship lock on to your peopleand beam them out of there before something happens.", "Gul Evek, those people are Federation citizens and I am swornto protect them. If your troops attack that village, my security forceswill respond.", "Oh, yes, I do. That is why we must to stop this now, beforeit's too late.", "Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millionsof lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that same path again. Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us onelast chance for peace.", "Beam up the away team immediately.", "Anthwara, I want to make absolutely surethat you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving upyour status as Federation citizens, any future request you or yourpeople make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your ownand under Cardassian jurisdiction.", "It will not be easy, but with Admiral Necheyev's support, Ithink they will go along with it in the end.", "Where will you go?", "Well good luck, Mister. Good luck, Wesley.", "Energise. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek \u00ae and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright \u00a9 1966, Present.

And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiettime, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. Thereare some ancient ruins that are just being excavated.", "We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targetingarray. Mister Worf?", "Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with youfor a moment?", "I noticed several times during the briefing that you appearedto be a bit distracted.", "Is everything all right?", "Oh, I see.", "But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take partin that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich culturalheritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival.", "The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time, andstill be back in time for the rendezvous.", "Mister Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than atrip around the nebula.", "Report.", "On screen.", "Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard", "Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields.", "Bok!", "Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine ifit's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. MisterData, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federationrecords. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaulabout fifty years ago.", "Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all youcan about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained hisrank, I want to know why.", "Come.", "How old is the boy now?", "Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.", "Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that youhave a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. Iwas involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four yearsago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It wasall very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I wouldbe leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we nevermanaged to get together again.", "No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Mirandadecided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surpriseme. She was very independent, very strong willed.", "But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried tokill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good histhreat against the boy.", "What about his mother?", "Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talkabout running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on theagricultural areas.", "There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for humanlife signs.", "What about males?", "That's seven. You said there were eight.", "Male or female?", "Unless he were forced to.", "Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beamhim aboard.", "That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard.", "We thought you were at risk.", "Are you Jason Vigo?", "In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against hislife. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here becauseyou're in danger.", "The person who has made the threat is under the impression thatyou are my son.", "I don't know.", "Maybe we should contact her.", "Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find outone way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test?", "I doubt it.", "What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you aseismologist?", "Without an antigrav harness?", "So, what do you do?", "I see.", "Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collectedover the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. Andthis, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare.", "Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself. Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy forit.", "Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless.", "Would you like some tea?", "Something else?", "Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much asurprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would haveliked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. Youlook a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like tomake one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. Ifshe had, I would have been part of your life.", "I think it would be better if you stayed on board theEnterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok.", "Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by hisson. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill myson.", "Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want toconfront him, settle this matter.", "I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind usthan I am.", "We'll get you some quarters.", "Jason. Your being here? I hope it will give us the chance toget to know each other.", "Understood.", "Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,DaiMon.", "Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok.", "But he's no longer there?", "I see. Do you know his whereabouts now?", "But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems.", "Plot a course. Take us out of orbit.", "I think I need to talk to a parent.", "I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers Ihave no idea what's underneath.", "Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. Mysense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would bebest if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to.", "Security to Captain's quarters immediately.", "Could it have been another hologram?", "Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate.", "Good. Keep me posted.", "Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason.", "I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is.", "Criminal record?", "Trespassing?", "Thank you, Mister Data.", "Good morning.", "Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. Now, it mightnot have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating.", "That wouldn't be wise.", "I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has astarship, he has technology.", "You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create somevery challenging climbs. We could go down together and I could show youhow to use theprogramme.", "Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled asyou, but I'm not inexperienced.", "Why didn't we detect it before?", "On screen. Is it another holographic device?", "A message?", "Can you translate it?", "He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Whydoesn't he do something?", "Tea, Earl Grey, hot.", "It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'llbe ready for you. Why don't we settle this now?", "It was self-defence. He fired on my ship.", "I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'msorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back.", "You cannot put a price on a life.", "No.", "What do you mean degenerative?", "Is he going to be all right?", "I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and youknow, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn'twant me to reach out to him.", "Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've foundout that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it'sonly petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I hadbeen part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now.", "And be patient.", "My understanding is that such devices were impractical.", "What range would that kind of transporter have?", "Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard theEnterprise again?", "If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beamsomeone away.", "I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any waywe can protect him?", "Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo?", "Would you wait outside?", "I like climbing. There's something about actually having yourfate in your own hands.", "It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok'sship. This could all soon be over.", "I thought it would make you feel better.", "Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of hercompletely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,if you wouldn't mind telling me.", "Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for awoman and child.", "Yes, that was Miranda, all right.", "Oh. I see.", "I'm so sorry.", "Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? Myown father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend thevineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we couldcome to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. Idon't want the same thing to happen to you and me.", "You're so wrong.", "I know.", "Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camorauthorities.", "It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, butit means something. There's some connection.", "But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairlineagain in the same way.", "You wanted to see me.", "Picard here.", "Have you been able to locate Bok's ship?", "Put it on screen.", "Plot a course. Maximum warp.", "The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any waywe could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship?", "I'll take that as a yes. You're with me.", "We'll deal with that when the timecomes.", "Understood.", "Lower your weapons or Bok is dead.", "You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know whatyou've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. Youmade it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your techniquewas flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctorinvestigated it, she discovered what you had done.", "There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in wasvengeance.", "He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command.", "He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. TheEnterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go,they won't attack you.", "They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until theFerengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that hedeceived you.", "I'm glad to hear it.", "Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board theEnterprise for a few more days?", "I understand.", "I will.

RO", "We could station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoiddetection. RO", "That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need toknow it now. RO", "I knew that I could count on you. RO", "I hope not. RO", "I'd like that. RO", "Why? RO", "But there are only six ships. We could even cut back thatnumber. RO", "Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggeststhat the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want toescalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true? RO", "Laren, what's going on? RO", "Yes. RO", "What? RO", "Are you saying you want to back out of this mission? RO", "This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you backout now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We'recommitted to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carryout your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for havinglied to me about this operation. I would certainly have youcourt-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision.

I don't have that kind of money. Captain's log, supplemental. We have received wordfrom Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will beattacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position inthe Hugora Nebula to wait for them.", "As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them.", "Go to Red alert.", "What the hell is she doing?", "Can you counter the effect?", "Have they crossed the border?", "When she comes aboard take her into custody.

I don't know how or why, but I'm movingback and forth through time.", "I had this feeling I had physically leftthe Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewherein the past.", "You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking upfrom a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of theEnterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then itall changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in thefuture, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't rememberwhat it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember.", "No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds,the very touch of things, much more real than a dream.", "You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion,disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed andit all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. ButI can't", "Geordi.", "Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either.", "How about Jean-Luc?", "Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been?", "No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were alltogether on the Enterprise?", "Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you.", "Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines.", "How is Leah?", "What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er?", "Sidney.", "So what brings you here?", "Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth justto drop by.", "So, you've heard?", "I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run itscourse.", "Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah'sstandards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read yourlast novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, butfor the rest I", "I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What wereyou saying?", "No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints andspecifications, but this will be my first time aboard.", "I'm sure she is.", "No. It's just that you look very familiar.", "Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle.", "Actually, I really like running around the ship in my barefeet.", "A defect that you hadn't noticed before?", "If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my deathsentence?", "I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're goingto have to put up with me for a long time to come.", "Has Worf found anything?", "I wasn't dreaming. Something happened.", "Go ahead, Mister Worf.", "Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to DoctorCrusher's office.", "Admiral.", "Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantlyaggressive move?", "What are our orders?", "Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone?", "Understood.", "This is not my time. I don't belong here.", "I was somewhere else a few moments ago.", "No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long timeago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. Iwas talking to Beverly.", "I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I wastalking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. Iwas in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital.", "Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the IrumodicSyndrome.

I want to see Data!", "Yes, I think he is.", "You see them, don't you?", "They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are theylaughing?", "Yes, Data. We'll go see Data.", "I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there,back on board the Enterprise.", "Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.", "Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you havehere. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge", "You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling.", "A week. They've prescribed peridaxon.", "Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can preventthe deterioration of the synaptic pathways.

Lieutenant, security alert two.", "We're on our way, Chief.", "This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in theNeutral Zone, in the Devron System.", "No, we'll proceed to Farpoint.", "You heard me.", "Mister Worf, will you man your station.", "I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed withour mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right inthinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers.", "Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'llbe in main Engineering.", "Mister O'Brien, will you use thesespecifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer.", "But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trustme. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child buildingthose model starship engines. They were well worth it.", "From your Starfleet records.", "Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you.", "I could use your help with the infuser array.", "As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasmaconduits.", "It happened again.", "Yes.", "It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. Atfirst, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then Iwas in the past just before our first mission.", "Counsellor, do you remember when I firstcame on board the Enterprise?", "What happened after the welcoming ceremony?", "Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Doyou remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zoneto investigate a spatial anomaly?", "For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future.", "These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will findanswers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerousthreat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battlereadiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed.", "I want continuous subspace sweeps. We maybe able to detect a temporal disturbance.", "Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience amomentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I wantyou to take command immediately. Number One?", "Speaking of disorientation, are you all right?", "You have the Bridge, Number One. I'll be in my Ready room.", "Come.", "What's this?", "Beverly.", "Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly?", "But you said yourself that this is only a possibility.", "I prefer to look on the future as something which is notwritten in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years.", "Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone?", "Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on?", "No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone.", "In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of aspatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in theNeutral Zone.", "If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might behere too and we have to find out.", "But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, Iknow what we have to do!", "Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons havetaken over the Romulan Empire.", "I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know.", "Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven.", "Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System.", "Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners arefaulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves.", "Will, that is just not good enough.", "Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He'sbeen sitting behind that desk too long.", "Medical ship?", "Yes. Yes!", "I think I can arrange that. Data, find the Pasteur. I havesome pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have.", "Let's just choose one.", "So, did you get my message?", "Oh. So that's why you married me.", "Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us.", "Yes?", "So, you kept the name.", "No, I'm fine. I don't need rest.", "Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have afew years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do notwant to be patronised.", "Now, I'll go and get some rest.", "We'll find the anomaly. I know we will.", "Report.", "Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data?", "There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasmafield, highly disruptive.", "This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now.", "Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do yousense an alien presence?", "I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed tohappen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room. Q", "Q. I knew it. What's going on? Q", "The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. Q", "You accused me of being the representative of a barbarousspecies. Q", "We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful andbenevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again? Q", "Are you putting mankind on trial again? Q", "Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago andwhatever's going on now? Q", "The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related towhat's happening? Q", "Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? Q", "That's only four. Q", "Did you create the anomaly? Q", "Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Q", "Why? Q", "Guilty of what? Q", "We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted newspecies, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. Q", "We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is notfor you to set the standards by which we should be judged. Q", "You're going to deny us travel through space? Q", "Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. Q", "Me? Q", "What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Q", "Commander, assemble the senior staff and goto Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought.", "Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel thatsomehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. Ithink he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to bethe cause of the destruction of humanity.", "So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all threedifferent time periods?", "Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. Headmitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now itoccurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to savehumanity.", "Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, withmyself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest inwhat happens to me.", "If I weren't travelling through time I would never haverealized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in thepast as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, myability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what'sgoing on.", "Go ahead.", "We're on our way.", "All stop. Initiate long range scans.", "We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship.", "On screen.", "But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We haveto get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to crossthe border?", "I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to theDevron System.", "I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worfthat I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyaltythan rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you'renot the Worf once I knew.", "Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you reallydo have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust andloyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well.", "Terms accepted.", "Engage.", "Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine.", "I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief.", "Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish tospeak with Commander Riker.", "They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically.", "I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of,even if they don't.", "I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now Idon't think I have any other choice.", "Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted toinform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station.", "I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform DoctorCrusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay?", "Is there anything else, Counsellor?", "What about him?", "I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties?", "I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the twoof you will find some way to deal with the situation.", "Tea, Earl Grey, hot.", "There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate theanomaly in the Devron System.", "No.", "There is no need to make threats. We each know theconsequences.", "Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five.", "Engage.", "All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data.", "We have to get as much information as possible about thatanomaly.", "All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past.", "Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data.", "On screen! On screen! Let's see it!", "I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now?", "You're not thinking about leaving?", "There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other wayto scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in anormal sensor sweep.", "That's it. Make it so.", "But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay hereuntil we find it, no matter how long it takes.", "Beverly, I cannot believe that you are notwilling to stay here until we", "Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concernshere. What you don't understand is that", "You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. Butwhat you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said thatall of humanity will be destroyed.", "What?", "Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Q", "Answer me. Q", "What help? Q", "My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now,tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroyhumanity? Q", "By doing what? When? How can", "Report, Mister Data.", "What is the source of this energy?", "What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inversetachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing lookslike.", "I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make itso.", "How is this possible?", "Anti-time?", "So if time and anti-time were to collide", "Data, what could have caused this collision of time andanti-time?", "I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do themodifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory asto what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly?", "I don't understand why it's bigger in the past.", "Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room.", "What's going on?", "Weapons status?", "We have to stop it!", "We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going tobreach.", "No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity.", "Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what iscausing the temporal anomaly.", "We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now! Please, listen to me!", "How is she?", "So this is affecting the entire crew.", "We have to find out how widespread thiseffect is. Contact Starbase Twenty three, that's the nearest outpost. Have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs oftemporal reversion.", "Mister Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan?", "Good. When it's done I want you to find some way of collapsingthis anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis ofwhatever solution you come up with.", "Dismissed. Q", "Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind? Q", "Home? Q", "Q, is there any point to all this? Q", "So the anomaly is here too, at Earth. Q", "The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Q", "Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomalysomehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Q", "Let's concentrate on how this anomaly wasinitially formed. Speculation?", "Is there any way that we can scan the interior?", "Do you know what could?", "Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board?", "Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly?", "What is it?", "Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one pointin space.", "Computer, where is Admiral Riker?", "Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward?", "Thank you.", "Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causingthe anomaly. We have to go back.", "Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomalywith the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it inthree different time periods!", "Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, thetachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different timeperiods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I meanwhen the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I meaneverything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like thechicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it startedin the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That'swhy it's getting larger in the past.", "Yes! Right. That's it.", "Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as ittravels backwards in time.", "Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System.", "I was right.", "We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time.", "The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do.", "Data, disengage the tachyon pulse.", "Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the threetime periods is what is causing the anomaly.", "Is there any change in the anomaly?", "Disengage the tachyon pulse.", "I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage thetachyon pulse immediately.", "Why isn't the anomaly being affected?", "I've shut off the tachyon pulses in theother time periods but it hasn't changed theanomaly.", "That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in theother two time periods", "It may be dangerous to take the ship in.", "Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centreand transfer all available power to the shields.", "No, Lieutenant, I cannot.", "I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were inyour position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. Butyou're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. Iknow it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take theship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warpshell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may notsurvive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greaterpurpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you canpossibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about eachother, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only beentogether for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in thefleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking youfor a leap of faith, and to trust me.", "Take us in, Chief.", "A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapsethe anomaly.", "Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, layin a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate astatic warp shell.", "The other two Enterprises, they're on theirway.", "All hands, brace for impact!", "Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reachthe centre?", "Initiate warp shell!", "No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long aspossible!", "Transfer emergency power to the antimattercontainment system!", "Maintain position! Mister La", "Data, report!", "Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Q", "Did it work? Q", "What about my crew? Q", "Thank you. Q", "You had a hand in helping me get out of this. Q", "I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myselfhere. Q", "When I realised the paradox. Q", "Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Q", "Mister Worf, what's the date?", "No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use somesleep. Captain's log, supplemental. Starfleet Commandreports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone, and there is nosign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only memberof the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced.", "No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join youthis evening. If there's room.", "Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite acard player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long timeago.", "So.
