It seems we're alive only because we have been placed onprobation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. How the hell do you know that, boy? Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Q court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamedof it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with thatline from Shakespeare. Kill all thelawyers. Q Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and theplanet. Force fields full on. They're forcing a difficult decision on me,Counsellor. Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet youknew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct thatis uncivilised. Reverse angle. Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers knoweach other's abilities. Steady on that. I, er, I hope we can be friends? Worf, inform the engine room we need more. As if it's something Q is doing to trickus? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. Begin countdown. Mark. One further thing. A special favour. Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for anyreason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try andtake them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship cando. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximumacceleration. It seems I did make that bargain. Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them onready status. Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humanswore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. Q Get off my ship. Q Tasha, no. What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Q Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myselfwith children. Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have underFarpoint, Groppler. Do we have clearance? Children are not allowed on the Bridge. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaultingprisoners is hardly a fair trial. Q Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. I see nothing so bitter about that. What was my answer, computer? Q I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly ofyou. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down toAltair Three. Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. You will agree, Data, that Starfleet'sorders are difficult? Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on allfrequencies. I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. Q Stand by. Engage. Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open toguesses about what we've just met. Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no FarpointStation, if I'm right about this. Q No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute,to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. Q Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. Get off my bridge! Q Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig mainphaser banks to deliver an energy beam. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'lladjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. Very good, Commander. Exactly, yes. Are you reading any of this? Off the bridge! Both of you. Are you certain? Counsellor? What is it? Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court'scontention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Testwhether this is presently true of humans. Q There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a longmission ahead of us. Q Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in alllanguages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are notasking for any terms or conditions. Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer onlyspecific charges. Q I asked if you knew who it is. Youmentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. Raise all shields, phasers at ready. Good idea. But futilely. Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief MedicalOfficer I want. And you don't intend to back off that position? Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. We question whether this court is abiding by its own trialinstructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat therecord? Q Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia ofhuman information without knowing a simple word like snoop? The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops positionthere As simple as that. Which your world furnishes you in plenty. That is enough, damn it! Q Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want alook around? Your son? I do have some questions for you though. RIKER Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Q Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, couldthat be the Hood returning here? Search theoretical. Is the viewer ready? Hail it. Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceedin our own way. Q Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handledit quite well. But don't touch anything! Try it out. Thepanel on your right is for log entries, library computer access andretrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have Picard. Go ahead. Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed,Groppler? If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know thatthe unknown is what brings us out here. Q Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. Ifwe're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you cantorture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there,Q. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty fourhours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed withoutincident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face somecritical test. Guilty. Provisionally. Q Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. Q Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on alldecks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucersection, Lieutenant. It means to spy, to sneak. Do nothing that he asks. Q Data, call medics. Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Q All stations? And it's your belief that this is what made it possible forthem to construct this base to Starfleet standards? Come. Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider andapprove you a transfer for you. None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every lifeform had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm lookingforward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transportersdo. Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it toshape itself into whatever form you needed! We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Personal log, Commander William Riker. Stardate41153.7. The Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station, where Iawait the arrival of the new USS Enterprise to which I have beenassigned as First Officer. Meanwhile I have been asked to visit theFarpoint Administrator's Office, in the old city. No! Do nothing he demands. Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised theprisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you breakyour own rules. Q Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? TransporterChief! Q Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Q We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we hadon our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Q It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement forStarfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around findinghow and why the life form there built it. And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I madeyou come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointedout, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp ofstarship operations. In return for some pain you'd given other creature? Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? Some problem, Riker? I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For youto work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of aterrible personal tragedy. The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit withus here. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what youare? Q Sense anything, Commander? Have the two of you met before? He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stunsetting? Q My crew and I need a bit more informationbefore we make our recommendations to Starfleet. I'll attend to my duty. Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section athigh warp velocity. Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Q I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Q Would you object to your Captain ordering aclearly illegal kidnapping? I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me aship with children aboard. Are you sure? Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent theCommander to me when he's finished. Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Q Make it so. Was there a reason? Q Beyond? Leave us! We've passed your little test. Q But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already startedto make rapid progress. Q I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You areconsidering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,you may lose. Q Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to thehostile to blind it at the moment we separate. Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your reportas almost magical attempts to please us. Then I mean now, Commander. But these courts happened in the past. Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Q Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximumacceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, meansthat we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hopeis to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our onlyother option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth asthey demand.
