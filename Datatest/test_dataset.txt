Worf, this is the Captain. These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly whatfollowed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a StarfleetCaptain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't ita little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain'sjudgment? Bring photon torpedoes to ready! And that's it? No other comment? An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by takingover our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finishus. Q Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that cando all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. You requested this posting? And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since acaptain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what Iproject. You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? Reverse power, full stop. I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routinesafety precaution. Q Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime,I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing todetach saucer section. so that families and the majority of the ship'scompany can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive,containing the battle bridge and main armaments, will turnback and confront the mystery that is threatening us. No ID, no answer to our signals. From the same source as before? Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their pastassociates. Always. Put it on main viewer. Identification? Doctor Crusher. Understand, Commander. I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. At the moment of separation, we willreverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead andclear of us. Do you know who it is? Captain to CMO. Good, since we admire what we've seen of your constructiontechniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbaseselsewhere also. At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful.
