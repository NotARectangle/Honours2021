Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation betweenthem. Yes, La Forge? On screen. Counsellor, do you remember when I firstcame on board the Enterprise? We are in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation. What sort of threat? Is this a personal matter? Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beamdown. Karnas, I asked Doctor Crusher to bring with her the visualrecords we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look atthem? Some problem, Riker? Korris and the other Klingon are dead. Somebody? Make it so. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will youplease explain why you attacked us? What are you doing? Him? Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with mystaff. Stand by for further communications. Yes, I do, Data. And I believe it is our job to out-con the conartist. Proceed, Mister La Forge. Do nothing that he asks. Q Then, as Captain of the starship Enterprise, I ask you not tomake that sound. Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in acontinuous cycle. Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why Istarted to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. Understood. Keep me informed. Picard out. I'll be in my quarters. It will be a dress uniform dinner, gentlemen. No! Speaking on behalf of men of Earth, which is indeed an awesomeresponsibility, I thank you. The transfer went well? Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. What about the others? Including the victim. Mister La Forge, prepare to reverse engines. Full stop. Mister La Forge, time is the one thingwhich we do not have in abundance. Activate impulse engines. But these courts happened in the past. Enough. Answers. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, Iwant them at a staff meeting in one hour. On screen. But why bring such a powerful weapon into the past? All right, all right. Legitimate questions about any of thisneed not be asked apologetically. You feel uncomfortable about aspectsof your duplicate, Data. We feel uncomfortable too, and for no logicalreason. If it feels awkward to be reminded that Data is a machine, justremember that we are merely a different variety of machine. In ourcase, electrochemical in nature. Let's begin to handle this as we woulddo anything else. I must speak to you about your son. Premier, with all due respect Right. Then you can offer no reason why they are set on thisprovocative course? Enough. Let's talk to Riva. Picard to Commander Data. Number One? I don't believe you. Run a level one diagnostic series. Come. I want a computerthat's one hundred percent to expedite Doctor Stubbs' experiment. Aswell as the food slots in Sickbay. Picard out. Let's investigate both possibilities. Captain's log, stardate 44356.9. Sensor diagnosticshave been completed and indicate that all systems are normal. Thereremains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path. Put it on main viewer. It would seem so. What? We did not attack you. We gave chase in order to recover aFederation-owned energy device which The Sheliak won't bargain. Yes, it is. Ambassador, I came to alert you that theRekags and the Seronians are in disagreement about the seatingarrangements at the conference table. In that case, make our heading nine two five mark three seven. We are going to make another attempt shortly. Picard out. Report. Their condition? All it'll do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not agood idea. Her powers are, at the best, unclear. Think about it, MisterWorf. Transporter technology can make things appear and disappear. Theillusion that she can transform herself into a Klingon creature couldbe createdby holographic projection. What happened between your people and the Borg? No, no, no you're not. It's just that Commander Riker came totalk to me this afternoon. About you. Correct. Permission granted. Tell me what you suspect. What do you want? Let him go. Hold a position five hundred kilometres from the periphery ofthe asteroid field. The Battle of Maxia. I've never heard it referred to sodramatically before. My sincere regrets, Bok, but that vessel refusedto identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. I understand your position, but I', sure you're aware that theFederation cannot interfere in what is, by definition, an internalKlingon affair. Will, if you've come here for sanction to take matters intoyour own hands, I can't give it to you. Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. What is yoursituation? I want you to know we're very proud of thescience fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue acareer in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your scienceprojects? Have you identified the source of her power? It happened when I reached for the bowl of fruit. In the meantime, I think I'll go get my jacket. Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myselfwith children. I respect my officers' judgements. I wish I could help further. If a way appears to me, I will. Hail the vessel. Lieutenant? Beyond this place there be dragons. It's even said that crewsthreatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused toturn back. On screen. You get used to it. Q The Romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm withtheir disruptors. They've sealed us in. So what's the cause of my headache? He'll make a fine captain, JP. So I ask you again, why? Normally, I would be the first one to agree, but perhaps somethings best left in the past. And now that you have had a taste of captivity, perhaps youwill reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others. In anyevent, we now know about your race and we know how to imprison you. Bear that in mind. Now get off my ship. Make it so. Could there have had some sort of malfunction? A reactor corebreach? It might be viewed as an act of aggression. I know. I know. It has been hard on you. Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerableamount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that yousimply imagined Freeze programme. Make it so, Mister Worf. Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that. Successful? You expect me to apologise to you? Stay calm, everyone. Open hailing frequencies. I'll be in Sickbay. Yes, Number One. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Doctor. Wesley. Picard out. Hail the Krayton. I trust that that can be avoided. I will respond to yourrequest shortly. Viewer off. You are using your position as a Starfleet officer to affectpolitical change on your planet. There could not be a worse compromiseof our fundamental principles. Please may I have your attention. Please may I have yourattention! Stop that immediately! Well, that's better. Now,what's your name, young man? No. Troi. Troi, we must talk. I believe it's possible tooutmanoeuvre this creature, and beam you and Ben back up to the ship. We've been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle. Whenthe creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? And? That's history fulfilling itself. Geordi, I'd like you to talk to Counsellor Troi. She'sexpecting you. Overtake, warp eight. Full weapon systems. Lock on. Open a hailing frequency. But he's no longer there? What are you saying? Number One, why haven't you left that building? Then who will they follow? You? Mister La Forge? Take this message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We'll bewatching. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Take a well-armed away team and transport down to thosecoordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on yoursignals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble. Perhaps later, Lwaxana. Mister Data and I were just about toshow Reittan Grax the er, the er, the new door mechanisms on the aftturbolifts. If you'll excuse us? Which explains why Data could be left outside in no danger fromthat creature. Whatever happened to the colonists, he would be found bythe first Starfleet crew that responded to the signal he transmitted. In my Ready room, when your duties permit. I will take this to Starfleet myself. No. It hit with more impact. I understand. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Transmit friendly greetings,all languages, all frequencies. Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making thissituation worse than it is. Acting Captain? How are you feeling? Anna, Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is alot of equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it tocontact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave. Thanks, Number One. He's my number one Dad. Aboard a starship, that is not necessary. We are all capable ofexercising self-discipline. Now, you will refrain from using them. Who was the last person to speak with her? What did you find? Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal. So then you deliberately used Deanna. Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now! I asked for Commander Riker's report, Acting Ensign Crusher. And since it now seems clear that you are unable to function within thelimits of that appointmentLAFORGE I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference willhave to be postponed. Yes, of course. Number One, put a technical team together. Let's get these repairs underway. Doctor Clark, this is Captain Picard. We are ready to beam youand your staff on board the Number One! Doctor Crusher. Wait. If that is a Romulan ship, they will read our intent. It'll force them into taking a similar posture. We don't want to engagein battle. Yes, this is the fourth intersect in Jefferies tube twentyfive. I must say, you're looking remarkably well. No. I'll go. And you have survived all this time as? Number One, how? But it's just a jumble. Point one impulse, Number One. RIKER Mister La Forge. Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I haveresponsibilities. Open hailing frequencies. Is there some way of stretching out the formalities once theyarrive? Mister La Forge? You must be very bored, Q. Your imagination is running awaywith you. Q What launching? What's he talking about? Which you asked the computer to provide. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you cantorture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Mister Worf, prepare a tractor beam. Did everyone get out in time? Report. Speed, warp five. Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to acrew can damage your credibility as a leader. He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you. There are disturbing overtones in the ideaof a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware ofany other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might haveencountered recently? Full stop, Ensign. Who is to say that this history is any less proper than theother? Yes. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Jeremy, Wesley'sfather died on a Starfleet mission when he was younger than you are. But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's start withthem, Number One. Doctor, what is going on? Of what, Lieutenant? Counsellor, take him to Sickbay. Maybe Pulaski can help. Listen to me. You are not alone. Do you understand? We areall in this together now. Captain's log, supplemental. We are monitoringincreased military activity on Solais Five. I fear that without Riva,we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves. The boy? Nor would I, Mister Worf. Mister Data, is any of this possible? We're having a little difficulty on cargo deck five. Yourpresence is requested. Of course. A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does whilehe's asleep. Your empathic powers told you all this about me? Get me the Sheliak. We have no functional propulsion systems? You've piqued my interest, Number One. Please continue. It would appear so. She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortlyafter your arrival. He's not open for business yet. Are you all right, Counsellor? Food and water? Data, it's not too late. If you remove thefibres, then Geordi might yet recover. How long would you say they've been there, Data? Your colony was attacked by a warship. He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound there was noway to stop it. A life form. Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. I've never before seen the Lieutenant so unsettled. I've talked with him. It's entirely my fault, Marie. They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space. Let's see what they've stored. You still have no theory as to what's causing it? For what purpose? What We can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousandyears ago. Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his societyat hand and he conceived this Contract of Ardra to motivate change. Ormaybe there was an Ardra of some sort who is the basis of thismythology. Who knows? The point is that somehow a fundamental theologywas created which transformed this society, but in the process ofchange, created this latent fear which has been passed down throughgenerations. Data, from your own experience of performing EbenezerScrooge, you're aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator. Put it through, Mister Worf. Excuse me, Counsellor. What's our ETA? I appreciate your advice and concern, but this is not the timefor rash actions. We are still investigating. There are three other stations in this sector we have to visit. Let'sproceed in a calm and orderly manner. Increase power to I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard'sinterlink system. I think that it uses some kind of phased-pulsetechnology. Do you think it could be modified to generate a kedionpulse that would reboot Data'sprogramme? The question is, how are we going to deal with it. Computer, respond. Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Q It is possible she was an eyewitness to your father'sactivities on Khitomer. Mister Data, the rest of us may lose consciousness. If we do,it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed. Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on theBridge. And strength of character. Her loss will bedeeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out. Ensign Crusher, Mister La Forge, we aregoing to recreate the research station here on the holodeck. I want youto work with Commander Data on the preparations. In addition, CommanderLa Forge and Commander Riker, I want you to give the computer detaileddepositions of everything you saw, everything you heard while you wereon board. Counsellor, I want you to assist me during this inquiry. Mydecision about the extradition will be based upon the evidencepresented during these recreations. Stand by deflector shield. No need to report. I'm just here to do some work on my own. What about the planet surface? Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo Three, half impulse. RO Cargo One. This should be an interestingexperience. Compensation? You have stolen our children away from theirclassrooms, away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation? You claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed anact of utter barbarity! Are there any other ships in the vicinity? I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I would still make thesame choice I made all those years ago. I just wish that I didn't haveto say no to him a second time. Thank you, Chief, and well done. That'll be all. Under whose command in this sector? That is the second time you have accused me of speaking withanother man's voice. It's true he will always be a part of me. Hisexperiences, his spirit. But I speak with my own voice, not his. My love is a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseththe disease. The code, Mister La Forge? Now we now have a reasonable hypothesis asto whom. Hold this position. Hailing frequencies. Calling the Pagh. Thisis the Enterprise. We are here to assist. Do not fire. That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know whathas got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I willtell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every orderyou're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules ofconduct. Is that clear? Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'llbe in main Engineering. It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it. And it's been determined that they date back to the latenineteenth century? The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capablespecies. We can only hope that they realise it's in their own interestsand take similar action. Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is somuch to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mister Riker. Notify all sections we'll be leaving this area in one hour. All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in thestructural alloys which allows us to trace our material. Number One? Do you remember that folk melody I playedfor you this morning? Mister Worf, I didn't give you enough credit. Continue thesimulation. You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me. What have you done to him? You should have notified the Federation authorities. To concealhim was a clear violation of our agreement. Life forms indicated? Commander Data, escort Ishara to the transporter room. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. It's a little out of their territory. That is enough, damn it! Q Well done, Mister Worf. Commander Riker has told me how supportive you were inEngineering. Well done. At ease. Sit here in Command. The question is, will the injectors come back online? Yes, once it's installed. On our way. Easily? Oh no, not easily. We handle it because we're trainedto, as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But if the time ever comeswhen the death of a single individual fails to move us I haven't talked to it. You will now return control of this vessel to the Bridge whereit belongs. At once. Belay those orders, Mister Worf. Mister Data, what's their offensive potential? Yes. Come. Doctor, I don't think that's possible. Ensign, plot a course for Starbase two sixty, warp two. Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create alifeform? Can't you enhance the frequency? Open hailing frequencies. Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. We are able to make that determination. Data, you seem to have developed anaffinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can hebe trusted? Good. Now, our task is to eliminate from the ship's records anyinformation that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get towork. You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that. I'm glad you could join us, Mister Barclay. Your report, Mister La Forge. I've never seen anything like her. And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? Mister Crusher. Ambassador, your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, Iwould say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions. Why wouldn't he tell us the truth? The Satarrans' weapons technology is no more advanced than theLysians'. One photon torpedo would have ended their war. How is this possible? You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laserwelder can be deadly. What's going on in main Engineering? I suggestthat you cooperate. Wesley! Wesley! Q. Q Perhaps you're right. I understand the allusion. Colours representing countries at atime when they competed with each other. Red, white and blue for theUnited States. Whereas the French more properly used thesame colours in the order of blue, white and red. No. Release him. It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When helost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediatelyto the beam down coordinates. Corey. This is Captain Picard representing the United Federation ofPlanets. Guinan. On screen, Mister Worf. Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed. Bring him in. Not, I think, today, Commander. Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. We don't have it. Besides, Tasha was a child when this woman was born. Yes. It's defended by Starfleet. You don't think they're just goingto stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want. Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filledwith you. I will be the first to cheer when the Neutral Zone isabolished. But I wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshapethe entire Romulan political landscape. Bearing two seven, make that two eight five, mark two fivefive! Riker! Transporter room three, lock on to the intruder and transporther to the planet surface. Because I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of therenearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece. Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting like somekind of escort? On screen, Mister Data. Go ahead, Commander. Can you lock on to her coordinates? It's a defensive weapon. Have you been able to ascertain whathappened? Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has to arrived. They haverequested return of the renegades. Commander Data is my Second Officer. Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan. Lookthis isn't a Romulan labour camp. I don't have to answer yourquestions. And I don't give a damn what you think. Indeed. Especially since we know so little about their origins. But I think that I have constructed some plausible theories of my own. Someone that tense could be very unpredictable. Stay on yourtoes, Number One. Let's isolate and magnify that system. Report. If this hadn't worked, it would have been necessary to beamyour energy into empty space. Computer, what was the last known location of Commander LaForge? I demand to see a neutral representative as required by theFederation-Cardassian peace treaty. Very well, Doctor, keep us informed. Lieutenant, one of the Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. Ineed you to keep them on a tight leash. Evidently, you were abducted two days afterbeaming to the surface. You have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have takenus to the brink of war. Animal things? Riva, if you are ready, the situation at Solais Five is verycritical. We should not delay. Number One, any speculation on what we might find down there? Open a hailing frequency, Data. Computer, discontinue programme. Computer, exit. It wasn't this bad. But it's getting worse. On screen. What is it? What do you see? We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I neverbelieved they could be true. What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Q Main viewer. You say you are true evil? Shall I tell youwhat true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender ourfreedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. Yes. I do. First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6. TheEnterprise is nearing Qualor Two, home of a Federation surplus depotoperatedby the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector arrayended up in the hands of the Ferengi. Doctor, the transport ship Denver has struck a gravitic mine left over from the Cardassian war. They've sustained heavy damage. So what's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out ofhere? Come. Wait. Wait. That's not possible. Mister Worf. You are not the first officer on this ship to havea new family member. Take care of your son. The security matters canwait. Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? Captain, so far we have an isolated incident. If I can reachhim first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail. But if one of your ships decides to retaliate, there is a danger wecould lose control of the situation. Doctor, continue emitting the signals. Mister Worf, on screen. Thank you. Speed, warp seven. We may indeed. Those comm. panels are for official shipbusiness. Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us thatwe have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alienworlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I havedisregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thoughtit was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to sometemporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't itpossible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to helpme to choose, because it's the right thing to do? Think of him as someone you caredeeply about. I have no intention of compounding what you have done bycommitting another gross violation of the Prime Directive. Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt atcommunication. I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can beready, Admiral. All right, whoever you are, I can hear you. No, Lieutenant, I cannot. Proceed, Number One. Magnify. Doctor Katherine Pulaski? Is there any evidence to support this? He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood andon you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if youagree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available toensure that it is conducted impartially. I don't know. If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging theFederation into a Klingon civil war. How long before we regain attitude control? On our way. Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams, but in this case,bad dreams would be more helpful. In case we decide to surrender to them, Number One. What's the increase in efficiency? Sub-warp? It's several hours away then? Let's take a look atit. Enlarge to maximum. Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer areincompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time ofwar. What's the point of creating this fantasy? Q I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up theaway team immediately. Take us in. I have confidence in the self-control of my crew, Kamala, butthere are guests and civilians on board. Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in amoment. 2 I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. They're out of options. Do it! Is it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff arecarefully isolating you? Are you saying she's been bitten? Do you have a theory as to the cause? I understand there are nuances that only Kerelians can pick up. We just don't have the ears for it. How so? You are finished, Data. At least you kept your wits about you out there. Don't forgetthat. For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us inhis place would be. No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end. Stay awake. Mister Worf, what's the date? What makes you say that? What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? Mister Data, you will escort Q toEngineering. You will assist Mister La Forge. Mister Worf, hail theBre'el Four science station. Are you suggesting that a bubble could have made Doctor Quaicedisappear? Not yet. We do. Picard implicitly trusted you. Enjoy. Computer, stop playback. Computer identify musical composition. Are you both all right? Mister Data, can you access it? Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father'ssin. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime wasto lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But youshould not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of thatlie. Yes, I'm I have an away team on board the ship. The initial reportindicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it wasfrom an attack. Standard orbit. I ordered you to lie? What was Malencon doing when he was killed? Mister Data? What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated? Identify. From the moment I met you, I knew you were going to be trouble. Ask if they would consent to an examination, just to becertain. Sickbay. Not good is a galactic understatement. You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to losenothing, either way the challenge goes. Run a comparison using basic simple words from Dinasian, Dewanand Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. I'll follow. You go now. Very well, let's limit their access. But you instruct yourpeople they are guests. I already have a hell of a first officer. A product for which you have no use, but which the Ornaranscan't live without. I cannot allow Maxwell to ambush that supply ship. Mister Worf,now. Beverly. Beverly. Wake him. And then what you most feared, happened. Rishon went to fightwith the colonists, and died with them. Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can youunderstand what it is that I'll be right there. Let's have more talk, Data. Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course Telepaths? We're changing course. Set coordinates for the First City ofthe Klingon Imperial Empire. Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost? When you were here last, you were saying that you were feelingtired. Thank you, Counsellor. Magnify. I've read about them for years, but they were so delicate noone expected to find any preserved. How do you know about them? Er, I, er. Yes. A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in,used, cared for. He knows. We all know. Will he live? Any changes? Really? I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much Iappreciate. You're authorised to do so. Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number fourseven eight B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three. Mister Data? Very well. But I would prefer more recent intelligence on theexact layout of the installation. The most current information we haveis two years old. Let him go. Unbelievable! You are out of your mind! The Sarthongians aremerciless to trespassers. Conference. It's been tried. No response. Interrogate him here. And when the Legarans beam on board? Oh, no. Have you spoken with Chief Engineer Argyle about this problem? Things are only impossible until they're not. We now commit the body of Ira Graves to the timeless depths ofspace. No, thank you. What do you mean degenerative? You underestimate her. I know, because I once did. Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One. Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi. So dangerous, Mister Worf, that he could have destroyed us inan instant had he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep clear ofhm. I want him to understand we mean him no harm We have no choice. Remember, aim low. Fire in short, controlledbursts. Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history ofinsubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during theCardassian incident at Minos Korva. Close the channel. The Borg have been busy. Well, not too bad, all things considered. Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. Come. I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! I want my father! This is your diversion, Number One, not mine. Computer, locate Council Member Vash. Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we facedeath. Jono! Jono, why do you make that noise? Is either populated? Please believe me, they're adamant. We are scheduled torendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will pick upReyga's body then. I'm sorry, there will be no autopsy. I'm sure you do. Like a decompression tank? Let's try it. It could all be part of the illusion. Commander Data, report. That's an emotional response, Will. We can't afford it. Warp factor eight. Engage. A missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole, but ifit should explode near the shuttlecraft they will be destroyed. You needn't. The answer is no. Your actions have been whollycriminal. You will not profit by them. Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. Number One, prepare your away team. And the planetary collision? No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and thethreats are mounting. We need Odan. Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening. The challenge, Mister Offenhouse, is to improve yourself. Toenrich yourself. Enjoy it. Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for thiswitness. Go ahead, Number One. Can we get the shuttles close enough without danger? Mister LaForge. Quite certain, Data. By all means, demonstrate your gifts ofaffection. Mister Data? Computer, why wasn't the holodeck programmeterminated? Mister Worf. I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. TheEnterprise will be leaving this sector immediately. What do you want of me? Surrounding the structure. Oh, I'm fine. No, those feelings came from his heart, Spock. He shared themwith me. I know. Tell me about him. It is if you wish me to release him to you. Ensign. I understand you're leaving for Starbase Five One Five. I think when one has been angry for a very long time, one getsused to it. And it becomes comfortable, like old leather. And, finally,it becomes so familiar that one can't ever remember feeling any otherway. Thank you, Chief. Mister Okona to the Bridge immediately. Open. The same demandhas been made by the Atlec legation. Will, you always seem to be after my job. Well, as soon asBaran feels that I've outlived my usefulness, he can kill me simply byusing the neural servo. So, I think we had better start planning amutiny. Thrill? If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. We may be very much closer indeed. What is that object? We don't have that luxury. Wake him. That'll be all, Commander. Mister O'Brien, energise. The southern pole? Perhaps my Chief Engineer could be of assistance? One moment. Gentlemen. The question is, who? I can't believe it's one ofour people. Only if you will talk to us. If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. If there are no more questions, you're all dismissed. What is, Commander? Well, let's just say I've heard rumours that the Uthat islocated somewhere on Risa. And so there is no evidence that a weapon was used? Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two. You're describing the situation on this ship. But CounsellorTroi reported nightmares. Come. I see. Do you think it's wise for you to go there alone? Afterall, they were expecting Baran to show up. Don't you think if I were to accompany you, it might seem moreplausible. Thank you, Mister Barclay. Your concern was justified, Ambassador. Evasive action, delta sequence. Ready phasers, Mister Worf. This is the Captain speaking. Alldecks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attemptto warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre yourthoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called theTraveller. The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system. Helm, stay with them. It does to me. I want to know what has happened to Data. I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is in no way dangerous? Five to beam up. Energise. First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I amreturning the conn to Captain Picard as we begin loading the vaccinesupply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal mission complete. I was afraid. Doctor, I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but ina situation like this, we have to be cautious. What we do today mayprofoundly affect upon the future. If we could see every possibleoutcome Everything. Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy froma former first officer of mine. And she wasn't ninety three years old. Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Readyphasers, load torpedoes. I pledge we will do everything possible to assist yourcontinued survival. Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent theCommander to me when he's finished. But my things Hold, Number One. Well, I don't. Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you'recertainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What'syour name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer. What's happened? Corey, that won't solve anything. Doctor Crusher has no knowledge of any of Starfleet's plans. She's a Medical officer. Destroy it. Investigator, in our system of jurisprudence, a man is innocentuntil proved guilty. Exactly when will they reach Haven? We can accommodate you, Captain. Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? What's happened, Number One? Report. Report! Report! Now, let me see the others. It's hard to believe. Your playing is quite beautiful. Doctor, I would deeply regret it if you were returning only toease diplomatic tensions. Or against you personally? That'll be all. Number One, a moment. Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. On my command. Anything is possible. So you came back to Starfleet. Can the old form still be used? The Federation's top negotiator taken outby a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Well, I suppose that is the end of Q. Q Engage. Captain's log, supplemental. We're en route to theFederation Research station on Gagarin Four. The mere thought of apossible connection between the Lantree tragedy and a genetic researchfacility fills me with profound apprehension. Make it so. We're on our way. That's not true. Transfer Engine control to the Bridge. I have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mindis set. Fire torpedoes. I, er, I don't know where to begin. It was Have you and Commander Data made any progress in finding ameans of communication? Gibberish? You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problemto worry about. I request a recess. I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. Ithink it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that willall change once I'm back on board. The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly? Magnify. You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbedduring the voyage. Data, you are my First Officer. So did I. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Into living plants? How is that possible? By whom? Do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fictionwhich you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? Whatyou're offering him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in. It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love. Jeremy must come to terms with his grief. He must not cover it or hideaway from it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe isfinite. That is one of the truths that all human must learn. Captain Picard to Ensign Ro. And the rest of the crew? Thank you, Data. We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're goingto return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase two one one. ThePhoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together. Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit youthe dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The onlyalternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back tostarbase in disgrace. Bring photon torpedoes to ready. Main phasers to ready. Go toRed Alert, please. Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his lifesearching for the Tox Uthat. Goodnight, my friend. Oh, I see. You've made a mistake. 1 I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed. Doctor? Really? Well? Well, we'll deal with the repercussions later. We must knowwhat you want. I do not recognise your claim on the Enterprise. Nor on thisworld, for that matter. In accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent, Icall for an arbitration. You could always resign your commission. Stay here with me. Can you revive him? Your service honours us. These people are no one's enemy, Senator. Gotcha! Now I gotcha. Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. RO It's your choice, Will. Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol ship, Mister Worf. They should be hailing us soon. Lieutenant La Forge, I'd like you tomonitor our velocity closely. Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher. Lay in a course for theMorgana Quadrant. Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think thatyou are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathyfor what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don'tthink that you can really be in love with me. No, not true. I was interested. And I was proud that my familywere helping to preserve the traditions. I just didn't feel bound bythose traditions. You are indeed a leader. When I realised the paradox. Q Our shields around the Romulan scoutship. They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated. Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine firstcommand. Well done. What are you saying? You insisted I look into her situation. Concur. Stand by. Alive? How? I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not adecision I can make quickly. You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now,according to our customs, is called an act of war. Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? Data, report. Are you all right? Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartographyisn't everybody's cup of tea. The last thing I want is to be forced into destroying one oftheir ships. Status of shields? On viewer. Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate? Perhaps you can. No, she survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going tofind her. What force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle to be thrownback in time? Donald, that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeologicalcuriosity. Mister La Forge, will you send another probe to the T-taurisystem? Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter room. Mister Worf, will you escort him to my ready room. The High Council would seem to agree. They consider the matterclosed. I don't. Mister Worf, the Enterprise crew currently includesrepresentatives from thirteen planets. They each have their individualbeliefs and values and I respect them all. But they have all chosen toserve Starfleet. If anyone cannot perform his or her duty because ofthe demands of their society, they should resign. Do you wish toresign? For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future. I don't know. But there is too much history between the Durasand the Romulans to discount the possibility. Yes, Ensign Laren, please have a seat. RO Mister Worf, make it so. What do you suggest? You must know we will not allow you to dothis. Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh ninehundred hours. We'll discuss it then. That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as aStarfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it. We were friends, nothing more. Q Steady as she goes. The rest of this is an issue, gentlemen, to be settled betweenyourselves. Now if you will excuse us, we have business. What? Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately,I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain WesleyCrusher. Beam us directly to the Enterprise Bridge. Were they pressured to return? Were they threatened with anypunishment if they didn't? Q I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough then Iwould begin to see some kind of pattern. So far, nothing. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty fourhours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed withoutincident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face somecritical test. But surely the technology must exist to save something of thisworld? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation StarshipEnterprise. Is it possible to lock onto the core itself, beam it intospace? They're not made anymore. I don't believe Ardra is capable of transporting the Enterprisea light year away. Keep hailing them, Mister Data. Repeat on allfrequencies. Go to Red Alert. Shields to maximum. Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer onlyspecific charges. Q Professor, this situation is more serious than you realise. Inless than five hours, those two planets will collide and a new starwill form. Unless we move to a safe distance, this vessel will bedestroyed. After that. She might be able to persuade the others. Fine, Mister Data. Proceed. Well, Mister Worf, let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man. Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data hassucceeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher hasdetermined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay'sUrodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship. There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator. What is it? Hailing frequencies. Any reply? Get that seal back up. Are you feeling better? Oh yes, yes. I never know when I'll have the opportunity toride. An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by takingover our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finishus. Q Warp five. Engage. Starfleet Command considers Graves' work on molecularcybernetics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priorityone action. A penalty box? I can't see anything. Magnify section two eight five. Hailing frequencies. On my way. Counsellor? Stop it! Picard to Riker. Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transportthe Boraalans? If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse. Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's preparedto admit. Mister Data, report. Any sign of the Cardassians? Report. I see I have no choice. Elaborate. What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. How long? Success, Mister Conor. With the upgrades to your biosphere, thecore fragment should no longer be a danger. Well, I think I'll be leaving. Your Captain is acting on an assumption, Will, and I'm not surewhat the result will be, or even that my assumption is correct. Wefound two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there wasonly one survivor of the war on Rana Four. Open a channel, Mister Worf. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we help you? And may this union be a productive one. I'll talk to her about it. I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyondGalaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude thatcan possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigationsensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from wherewe were? Easy, Number One. Let's find out what it iswe're dealing with. No, we'll find an alternative route. Let's go back up. I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and who she ischanges the moment the next mancomes into the room.  And I find myself hoping that the nextman won't come in. But, ofcourse, he does, and in a few hours, the ceremony will begin and shewill mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than hecares about her. And I can't help thinking how she will be with him. How she will change to accommodate him. We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Durasfrom the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to theRomulan-Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action, but we will bein a position to expose any Romulan supplies that attempt to cross theborder. Where were they standing? Data, you're moving about in a very,well, android way. What have you done with my ship? Let's just say my faith would be strengthened by a gesture fromyou, such as powering down your disruptors. How far inside Cardassian space is it? What's their condition? Mister Worf, check hull and shield integrity for any sign ofintruders. Let's hold this position for a while, Number One. This is worthstudying. We have little choice. Whatever has him is interrupting thetransporter beam. Remove it. I've had similar feelings. With everyone succumbing it's evenmore important that one of us attempt to keep control of his faculties. I want you to turn in, take a nap. I'll be on the Bridge. You canrelieve me in four hours. The facts are here. At least show them to someone who willrecognise what they mean. I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you. Damn. Sorry, Number One, what was that? Can you bring her out of it? Of course not. How are you? You have assaulted a Federation starship, killed and woundedseveral members of her crew, kidnapped two of her officers, and youdon't expect a response? Could this event have involved Hedril? Exactly, yes. Try to get more power to the field coils. You always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arrivingat the truth. Well, I hope you've learned a little wisdom along theway. And then, Lieutenant? It seems I did make that bargain. Yes, Mister Worf? Mister Data! And this? You have no other portraits of your fellow crewmembers. Why this person? I need to talk to a friend. Now that I know that you're listening to my voice, I find thatI can't think of anything to say. I will make the Khitomer massacre files available to anyone whowants them. To the High Council, to the Duras family, to you. Anyone. Yes, there is Doctor? I'm on my way to look in on your patient. It's the first thing you've said I do understand. I'll see whatI can do. And, please, stay off the comm. panels. Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship waslooking for. Proceed. I'll do my best to arrange that. I don't. Q Picard here. Curiouser and curiouser. Mister Worf, can we use the phasers to open a hole in thesphere? Agreed. If you care to join us, we have a well-proventransporter device But they'll benefit from the extended time. It will allow themto acclimate before returning to Earth. Agreed. Doctor, the success of this mission would be far morelikely if we could get our memories back. Is there anything you can do? Indispensable is the appropriate word. I think it should beonly you because you seem more able to control the effects of the timedistortion. Would a delay of one hour affect your plans? Number One, try to make some sense out of this mess. And the Klingon ship, the Pagh? Keep trying. Counsellor, you'll have to gather the parents. Data, can you determine for certain thatthe energy source from the planet is powering this creation? I think you've mistaken me for someone else. Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? Could there be some sort of cloning involved here? Mister Crusher. Reverse course. Full impulse power. No further questions. It's not him I'm inclined to judge. Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems. Can there be an intelligence at work here? Counsellor, do yousense a lifeform out there? Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactoryexplanation of this. Director Mandl. Lieutenant Yar, would you escortthe Director to his quarters. It takes very special people to live in such desolation. Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on. There's something else. Since his recovery, he's manifestedunusual abilities. Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineeringimmediately. The risk is too great, Commander. Grand. Mister Data, when we have a complete list of all thespecimens we will be carrying, I want you and Doctor er, Any response from Gravesworld, Mister Worf? Oh, er, Geordi, Deanna. I don't think you've met our host. Thisis Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Counsellor Deanna Troi. Thisis Commander Hutchinson. Mister Data, will you investigate the possibility of complyingwith Professor Moriarty's request. Set course for the nearest starbase. Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumedby your own pain. Believing your own lies. It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment,Number One. And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond thosefunctions and is developing a new capacity? Can we get through it? Understood. A simple yes would have sufficed, Number One. Our only influence, Minister, is by example. Timicin's decisionis his own free will, I assure you. That's correct. Mister Data, download the inventory and cross-reference it withthe medical computer. Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealttransported up. Captain's log, supplemental. Although it's beenfourteen hours since we arrived at'audet Nine. Hester Dealt has still not completed inspection of thecontainment unit. A transfer will not be permitted until he's assuredof zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas fromthe Rachelis System continue. Computer, explain Red Alert. Mister La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuitytransmitter? Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge. Can we modify the subspace isolators to give us betterprotection? Go ahead, Doctor. Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. Why did you steal my ship? In fact, it's more than likely that they will take good care ofher, if they want to use her as a bargaining chip. You have returned in order to give me this message? Of course. You could use a good herbicide instead of pulling the weedswith your bare hands. I missed it by less than a thousand metres, Enterprise. Adviseyour status. Get out of my chair. Q But I thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space. That's odd. We weren't notified of a rendezvous. Counsellor Troi, will you report to the guest lounge? Jono! Picard to Engineering. Then should we try to keep her asleep? Yes. Mister Worf, you will report back to the Bridge. Lieutenant? No, sir. What is going on? No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain togive the appearance of confidence. Go to warp engines, factor one. Engage. She has a Romulan cloaking device? Come. What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? I would like to discuss with you the specific areas of ship'ssecurity that I would like In this case, I think I do. Will? Number One, you have the Bridge. Are you suggesting this is somehow contagious? I know. Lieutenant, understand that I am not unmindful of themixed feelings you must have about this incident. Yes, Ensign. It's all over me. Time to come home now, Number One. Transporter room, we have afix on the away team. Beam them up. Chief Investigator, welcome to theEnterprise. I'm Captain Picard. This is my First Officer, CommanderWilliam Riker. Excellent. Now perhaps you can tell me what was so importantthat it required depriving the Captain of his cup of Earl Grey? Is he going to be all right? Ensign, set a course, warp six. Mister Worf, send a message bysubspace. Tell them to prepare for a rendezvous. The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come onboard. Would you care to meet us in the Observation Lounge? Why? At our first meeting you seized my vessel. You condemnedall humans as savages, and on that charge you tried us in a post-atomictwenty first century court of horrors, where you attacked my people. You again seized my vessel. Q No. He is more. I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in heretogether. No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest. I had hoped you would not throw away a promising career. Iunderstand your loss, We all admired K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will appearon your record. Dismissed. Mister Worf, isn't it time for the truthabout your father's innocence to be told? After all, you only acceptedthis dishonour to protect the name of Duras and hold the Empiretogether. Now that he has died in disgrace, what is gained by furthersilence? Data, you're the key to this entire mystery and you've donenothing but block my every attempt to solve it. Why are you fightingme? I've been away far too long. Can you ease the pain? Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth. Whether we approve of the Zalkonians' intentions is not theissue. But for what it's worth, I believe John is correct that hisexistence has broader ramifications than that of a simple criminal. In private and off the record. We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. Quite impressive. I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft ofpassion and imagination. That is not who I am. Q Then your friend is in trouble. O brave new world, that has such people in it. I'm sorry. We're increasing to warp two. Why? P2 Damn. Beverly, may I take off the uniform for a moment? A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caughton a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. Location? Would you care for something? So, Beverly. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying this ship has lost nearly eighthundred of its personnel? I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were inyour position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. Butyou're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. Iknow it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take theship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warpshell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may notsurvive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greaterpurpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you canpossibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about eachother, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only beentogether for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in thefleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking youfor a leap of faith, and to trust me. But do you understand the basis of all this nonsense betweenthem? Hold. Yes, Number One. That would be prudent. Make it so. I'll be returning shortly, Commander. Inthe interim, stand ready to initiate transporter code fourteen at mysignal. Any indications of weapons or vesselsbeneath the surface? Did she? Commander, could I have a word with you? I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaboratemeals either. No less so for me. But I promised cooperation, and that's whatwe shall give. Yes, Admiral. It may not be easy for you and I to see her thatway, but he does. And I respect that. They will remain here for now. The massacres in the Norkan outposts, for example. Yes, Number One? Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, couldthat be the Hood returning here? Maybe the rumours of a secret Romulan base in this sector aretrue. Picard to Commander Riker. If he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worryabout. Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Q Indeed. I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done longago. How long before we have warp power again? Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard ofthe Federation, of a Federation starship. Standby to receive emergencyteams. Commander, we will handle this one step at a time. Stabilisetheir power systems and tend to their injured, and avoid alldiscussions of where and when they are. That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes outevery year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. RO You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agreewith you. RO Report. By all means check the trace log. But even if the results arenegative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. Go ahead, Number One. And we are having similar difficulties reading you. I amadvising you and your away teamPICARD I, er Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. Our destiny is elsewhere. But I'm happy that yours is here withus, Counsellor. Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them. Really? Ah! You called me Picard. La Forge? Other opinions? Thank you for your advice.  PICARD Holodeck three. If you have only a vague intuition How is she? Doctor! On screen. Thehunt begins, Number One. RIKER Is it alive? You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. We most certainly are not. Now listen to me. No one here isgoing to die. The bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon aspossible. So I want you all to stop crying. Everything is going to beall right. Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians. An old man. Masaka's father. You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates andWill's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statisticsand glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I wasabout to put it aside and look at another file and then somethingcaught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will wasFirst Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam downduring a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a generalcourt martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knewthat I had found my Number One. Damn, I said put fusion generators under surge control. You'removing too slowly. Arm the torpedoes, man! Vigo! Get a fire control party up here! Are we ready, Number One? Needless to say, I've not succeeded. We'll contact you as soon as the sensors are back online. Identifying marks, Mister Worf? The next time the Enterprise appears, go through it with Data. Geordi will be able to learn from him. Maybe help him. Only from his writings. His judgments were required reading atthe Academy. Each community would be responsible for its own. Condenserscould make the difference between watering our crops or watching themdie. Mister Data, would you escort the Professor to his quarters. Conn report. How were your young trapped in the core? Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? K'mpec! Release him. Then I think she has a right to know that before she makes achoice about her future. Q I've heard of him. So you were emotionally affected by the music. Good. Well, now that's cleared up, let's, er, let's, er, let'sget acquainted, shall we? What do you think of your room? I know it's alittle sterile. But if there's anything you'd like? Pictures, perhaps,or games. I won't do it. I won't alter history. Q Ensign, put us back on course. Warp three. I have no idea. This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty ofAlgeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloakingtechnology. But not any more? Inform me as soon as it is complete. A strategic attaché with specialised knowledge in the frontierregions. I think you'll find the briefing interesting. You heard me, Number One. Report. I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my experiences, mymental capacities are all intact. Commander Data, what are you doing now? Number One. Screen off. I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made. Do you have battery backup? Who are you? Wesley? Yvette Gessard. Are you sure? Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We're in a very important conferenceright now. Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined Assemble a minimal away team. Plot a course. Take us out of orbit. Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen! Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support thishypothesis? Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward? So, while we still have some power left, itis time for difficult decisions. Opinions please. Data? So you stole it. The Paxans. Who are they? Is it God? Now, it's very important you answersomething. How do you recognise what it is? Chairman Songi, we will proceed immediately to your planet. Do you have any idea how many security officers there are onboard a ship like that? We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in fortyhours. Oh, no. I know Hamlet. And what he might said with irony, I saywith conviction. What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason. Howinfinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. Inaction, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. Q I haven't said yes yet. On the surface. Counsellor, any thoughts? It is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchangebetween the Iyaaran people and the Federation. You're certain this is Vulcan? An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I thinkthat Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze ofglory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the KolvoordStarburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked,you would thrill the assembled guests and Locarno would graduate as aliving legend. Only it didn't work, and Joshua Albert paid the price. Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question. Am I correct? What can you tell us about him, Doctor? Actually, we have been experiencing a few minor difficultieswith our new warp core, but my Chief Engineer assures me that we willbe under way within the hour. Energise. Mister La Forge, take us in a little closer. What the? Go ahead, Commander. Seal off the compartment. Prepare to vent the air from Good morning, Batai. Mister Riker, put us nose to nose with the Sheliak ship. Anymove she makes, match it. Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counsellor, do youbelieve a ship Captain should explain every order? That's fun. A forty eight Packard with white walls. Damn it, Icouldn't get the license plate. Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hopeso. No one is could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I neverthought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth Dynasty? Oh, yes. Do tell us. If there is to be a lasting peace, Gul Macet, neither you nor Imust allow any one man to undermine our efforts. Correction, Number One. Knowing the decision you face, I havepermitted you this gathering. Very well, Counsellor. We'll advise you further as soon as you reachyour destination, Number One. Picard out. How long is the interval? May I come in? Beverly, get out of there! Beverly! Thank you, Number One. Mister Data? It means almost certain death for you, Admiral. Then what was the foremost archaeologist in the Federationdoing here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep SpaceFour, and then an Al-Leyan transport to Caere, and then the shuttle toIndri Eight. Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight? Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he wasafraid. Well, I'm not satisfied. I want an explanation of this by thetime we reach Parliament. Viewer on. Can you short out the power? Is that all right? No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risklosing you. And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, andthey fell in love. Data, you're not going to submit. We're going to fight this. Ichallenged the ruling. Captain Louvois will be compelled to hold ahearing. She may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but Isuspect that she still understands its spirit. We will put to rest thisquestion of your legal status once and for all. Now, I have been askedto represent you, but if there is some other officer with which youwould feel more happy? Agreed. And our response? You have the Bridge, Number One. Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from thecombat area. Half impulse. You fell asleep. Q Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience amomentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I wantyou to take command immediately. Number One? Then how do you account for it? Perhaps you should beam aboard our ship. There's something weneed to discuss. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I'm bringing the runabout in. On viewer. I've just been paid a visit from Q. Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengitransmissions. Do your best, Ensign. Oh, yes. During my sophomore year, I was assigned to trainingon Morikin Seven. Well, there was a Nausicaan outpost on one of theoutlying asteroids, and one day <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. They're responsible for new starship development. Not for one moment. This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdictionhere. I think that's a little premature. We hardly know anythingabout each other. Good. Go into the cockpit, and look for a small comm. panel inthe instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here. You can relax, Doctor. A highwayman. It's a robber who attacks travellers, but nonehave been reported in this vicinity for centuries. No. Ten Forward, this is Captain Picard. I am prepared to discussthis situation. There is no need for further violence. Are you still unable to recall anything about your past? Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have twoextremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command. Our nextactions will have serious repercussions. We have good reason tomistrust one another, but we have better reasons to set our differencesaside. Now, of course, the question is, who will take the initiative? Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I mustlower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface. Oncethe shields are down, you will of course have the opportunity to fireon us. If you do, you will destroy not only the Enterprise and itscrew, but the cease-fire that the Romulans and the Federation nowenjoy. Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave the hailing frequency open. And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'llfind you other choices. He might have killed all of us. And I believe he was actingunder direct orders, Baran. You betrayed us. This has gone far enough. I think it is time that we had a new commander. Someone who will leadus to those profits that we've been promised. Well, I, er, what's our ETA? Mister Data, I look forward to your next concert. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. Agreed. Mister Sabin. So, what have you been doing for the past decade? How did this happen? Who are they? Identify them! How long will it take to complete a level one search? See if you can contact the colony. I will not have you telling me what courseto set. Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you honestly believe youhave sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry? Transporter room, lock onto the neutrino beam and stand by. It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy beingexpended. Commander, you have crossed the Neutral Zone. This isFederation territory. Now, you can serve from within either ofthese two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that topcentre target. You have to return the ball before it bounces twice. Alright? Let's try it. Engage. I'm Captain Picard. at warp factor eight? A Corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here. Wehave detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed anylight on this? Captain's personal log, supplemental. I have justwitnessed the total destruction of the Enterprise with a loss ofall hands, save one. Me. This is a hell of a time. Whatever it is, I don't want it toaffect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest ofthe crew until we've identified the cause. Well, I don't think I need to hear any more. That was trulyunique. We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to StarfleetAcademy. Captain, we're beaming over a replacement coil. Maybe. Any problems reported in that area? Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energyusage? Whereas you, of course, have a nobler purpose in mind. Have you lost your faith in Sto-Vo-Kor? And we're overdue for our computer refit. Number One, have youever considered whether Data is more human, or less human than we want? Premier. Oh, come on. This is a routine procedure. Quite commonplace. All right. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. Whatdo the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them? Instruct Engineering to proceed. It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can seewhatever is outside this vessel. Report, Mister Data. Explain. Nor can I change who I am. Mister Data, will you please report to my Ready room. It's a life, Data. It can't be activated and deactivatedsimply. This is a most stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea whatwill happen when Starfleet learns about this? Report, Mister Data. Number One, what is my present location? The Mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to theKhitomer massacre, one who has new evidence, K'mpec. We sustained some minor damage. Do you know what happened? Mister La Forge, chart a course for it immediately. Warp seven. And there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of thisdiversion. I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have notbeen affected either. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity,apparently, has no bearing on the phenomenon. What is this place, Mister Data? You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,he's still alive. He can help us get away from here. Q, I'm not your father confessor. You will receive noabsolution from me. You have brought nothing but pain and suffering tothis crew. And I'm still not entirely convinced that all this isn'tyour latest attempt at a puerile joke. Q I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Is there nothing you can do? Something has seized their ship too. They're in the samepredicament as us. Launch a sensor probe. Set it to searchfor the source of whatever this something is that is holding bothships. Go back to hailingfrequency, fast. And I regret, DaiMon Tarr, that I can no longernegotiate unless it isconducted visually. Stand down Red alert, but keep tracking their movement,Lieutenant. What is your status with him now? Yes. All right, let's proceed on the premise that what we havejust seen happened, and that in less than four hours from now, theEnterprise will be destroyed, and somehow, although this isunfathomable, I and I alone escape. Discussion. That analogy is not exactly Mister Data? I've been saving this for a special occasion. My brother onEarth produces fruit known as grapes, which he turns into wine. He'sreally quite good at it. Chancellor, we have a tradition called atoast. It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune, and Iwould like to propose a toast to a new friendship. On screen. What tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helplesschild? I was not informed either. Doctor. Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel? To find some privacy. Come. Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member ofyour away team. I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble. But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness. Come. I've no intention of performing for your amusement. Q Commander MacDuff, have the other officers listed here reportto the Bridge. Picard to Bridge. Thank you, Mister La Forge, but you've done your job. Now Imust do mine. I relieve you, Mister Crusher. Commander, I require your presence on the Bridge. I would rather discuss in person, Admiral. Transfer injector control to manual. What about the entity that controlled you, What were yourperceptions of him? Mister Worf, launch four Class A probes toward the planets. That's where it will be. The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall,Wesley, you took it very well. I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site onLandris Two. Could you put it through to my Ready room? You call this getting along? Life signs? Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbolbelong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling apath, crossing a boundary. Ah, Data. At least you're functioning. He is the Admiral, Karnas. Before he left on this mission, headministered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. Hewanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what thedrug has done to him. Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do youread me? Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a StarfleetCaptain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't ita little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain'sjudgment? Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. Sunad, this individual is a guest aboard our ship. We found himdying in a shipwreck. We returned him to health. Deanna, I wanted to see how you were and have a look at yourbaby! My goodness. How old is he? Open. Well, thank you for your concern. Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a feedback loop. Youcertainly can say. You have free will, you have a choice. Welcome back, Number One. I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I have to study upon Regalian law. Not at all, sir. Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at thosememories some other way? I think that much was obvious. Jared, you're a wise and experienced leader, and I assume youtrust your senses? Well that's brilliant. Well, yes, speaking as a mother. Mister Data, there's a reference in Captain Varley's personallog to a probe that scanned the Yamato. But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, Iknow what we have to do! Are you reading any of this? Doctor, you believe the Mintakans arecapable of harming Counsellor Troi? Yes, very well. I will monitor your progress from here. Butjust remember, ten minutes, no more. Worf. Q La Forge, everything's alright. We'veneutralised it. A malfunction. Emotional awareness. We are entitled to consultation under paragraph six hundred andfifty three subparagraph nine. No. Yes, I should be getting down to the planet. Commander Rikerwill be available here to show you anything that you want to see. Mister Data, how much time? Well I have been through every page of the Professor'spublished works, looking for some clue as to where to go next. So far,nothing. Yes, Mister Worf? Put it on. Thank you. Do you have one? Ensign, set in a course for the Vilmoran System. Warp nine. Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treatyof Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf? Well, Professor, my crew will continue to investigate, but fornow it would seem you have accomplished a miracle. The question is, nowthat you're here, what do we do with you? Indeed? mev yap! Sit down. We will begin the ja'chuq. Counsellor? Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. This is Captain Picard ofthe Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach. You know, we could make use of that. RO Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced thepassage of time while you were stored in the computer memory. I canassure you, we had no idea that that would be the case. That's not an answer. He is being treated for severe injuries. That's alright, Mister Worf. I think, for now, circumstanceswarrant caution, nothing more. Gowron or K'Tal? Put it through. I thought you might enjoy the Bridge, Miss Brianon. I'm awareof your interest in science. Perhaps you'd like to see the computerterminal Helm, initiate pursuit. Power to do what? Pull any personnel you can use. Wait. You can. I'll let you. But first, tell me. What is, whatwas your other choice? P2 Open a channel. No. Yes, you do, somewhat. But not all of it. Geordi, what's going on? We just wentinto warp. What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here? You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft. Commander Data, you will accompany the Doctor to the surface. Can you make contact? Keep me apprised of your progress. On screen. Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, orthat you're insane. But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. The lift's falling! Hang on! Ambassador Odan, this is Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel. What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and It was a bad idea whose time is long past. I am aware of that. But each of us, including Doctor Palmertook an oath that we would uphold the Prime Directive, if necessary,with our lives. But Mister Data is a member of my crew. Now, Mister Worf. 1 Are you all right? We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need toneutralise the homing signal Is that how you interpret it? In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I growup again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybefifteen years. The question is what to do until then? Yet at one time you found something very appealing about it. Picard to Crusher. Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out. Didn't anyone tell you weapons aren't allowed on Risa? Your vision of Doctor Soong. How is your investigationproceeding? Very good. WORF It was a save our skins manoeuvre. We were finished. On fire. We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttlecraft forweeks before we were picked up. I haven't thought about this for years. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome aboard. We hope your journey willbe pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my First Officer,Commander Riker. Beverly! Arranged marriages have been the basis of politicalalliances in many cultures, including our own. Bring photon torpedoes to ready! Come. Almost human. With just a bit of a headache. On what authority? He can take all the credit he wants, I don't caret. But I doneed a ship. Well if Gowron won't talk to me, get someone who will. Somebody on theHigh Council. K'Tal, perhaps. Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got onit. Conference evaluation. But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairlineagain in the same way. Ensign, engage. Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? Goodnight. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Stabilise. I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulsepower, Lieutenant? Guinan. Please, come in. For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me. But it puzzles me. If you feel that way for Tasha, why have youchallenged her to a fight to the death? A straw? On screen. Status, Mister Data? Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I am your friend. I canonly imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know I'mhere. We didn't know that. We didn't even know if you were real. Allwe knew was that a little girl's imaginary friend was frightening her,threatening her. You have the conn, Mister Crusher. He recognises your interest in profit. Or is that an incorrectassumption? So if time and anti-time were to collide There's more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarianship so far off course? What was its point of departure? No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge thispower cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energyrelays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one morecharge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate theshuttlecraft's engines. Is there anything you'd like to say before we begin, NumberOne? This is not the time. Damn it, even I can see the umbilicalcord is virtually uncut. The child, the child depends on him. Number One, did something unusual just occur on the Bridge? What is your designation? One of the aims of the exchange programme, Commander, is forall of us to learn tolerance. As for my crew, it may be healthy toshake up the status quo occasionally. Of course. The three of you will remain as needed to assistDoctor Crusher. RO JR So you think it would be unwise to letEndar see Jono? Patience. Patience. An unfortunate reality. What if I challenge this ruling? Screen off. Set course two two three mark three five seven. Full impulse power. Initiate Kumeh manoeuvre. Then perhaps you would do me the pleasure of getting this shipunderway. If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know thatthe unknown is what brings us out here. Q Bearing and speed? Q, there are millions of lives at risk. If you have the powerto Q That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and theold man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into theirbelief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure. It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, aconsort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbolanywhere else.]TROI Well, if it's anything like the last time, I'm sure you won'tbe disappointed Always. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

The Yridians are information dealers. They mayhave been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send asignal before they were destroyed? We may have done too much to help them already, Doctor. At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island. Temba,his arms wide. Go ahead. Yes, but if Solok were to go to Celtris Three for legitimatereasons, we would be interested in quietly booking passage for thejourney. Oh? How so? What's the last thing you remember? Congratulations. Unidentified freighter, this is the Enterprise. Understood. Disconnect the power-transfer beam. Sleep. You are hereby requested and required torelinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, CommandingOfficer Cairo, as of this date. Oh, good lord, a highwayman. Worf! Then you may have brought it aboard this ship. Was there amedical scan when they transported? Ready tractor beam, Mister Worf. You remember Commander Riker. Let's get them off there. T'Jon, stand by to beam over. What would you have me do? March down there and destroy theman? I beg your pardon? Well that is your protected right. Number One, I want you to analyse our sensor readings of theBorg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or analien ship which they captured. Then run an analysis of this subspacedistortion they used to escape. He's added another chair to the negotiating table. I heard that. They were not words exactly. A sudden sense offear. A sense of fear of heights. When she left to become head of StarfleetMedical. But going from one assignment to another is part of the lifewhich you are choosing. Situations like these are never easy, Number One. RO Thank you, Lieutenant. I don't know. Suggestions? That's my job, young man. Anna, stop! You know better than to try and movetrilithium resin. Scanning us? Why? What could it hope to learn? Picard to Counsellor Troi. Get it to Sickbay right away. Whatever the problem, we'll handle it up here. I am prepared to offer an added incentive. If you win, I'lltake you to the ruins of Ligillium. Without an antigrav harness? Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others? The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. There will be another day, Commander. Do not forget what hedoes here today. Do not let your children forget. On screen. Traveller? What is your destination? Lantree. Are you under attack? Lantree? Lantree, this isthe Enterprise. Come in, Lantree. Replay that last transmission. Ambassador? I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularlygood subject. I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-Cwill fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,hopefully, will continue for a long while. Mister Worf, you come with me. May I suggest that you arrange to meet at another time, afterthe ceremony? Find him. The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I amthe Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise. Batai? JR I don't know, Number One, but she needs our help to get back. Mister Worf, keep your lock on her no matter what happens. With regard to the surrender, DaiMon Tarr. The facts aresomewhat different. The warbird has vanished as well. I have something else for you, Baran. My help? Present condition? In what way? Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives? Then formulate this one. How do I deal Riker and the Hathaway? I will await your answer on the Bridge. And, Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. What's this? Activate it. You're sorry you came tonight? I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing forsome dreaded recital. Doctor? Acknowledged, Doctor. Mister DataDATA Mister Data, what's our heading? They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over asCommandant, Starfleet Academy. What's wrong? Admiral. I have to tell you, you must notexpect me to permit any action against Mister Tarses solely on thebasis of Betazoid intuition. Right? Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,I'm better. The injuries are healing. Lieutenant Yar, you stay at your post. If this is the result ofa Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. Acknowledged. You can't go through with the ceremony. And what would that be? In what way? How is Miss Brianon? That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what youare? Q It's on page 244. Open hailing frequencies. I'm afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here. Iwant to reassure you that we have no hostile intention. Energy? Is that why you're draining our shields? No. he does not. I'm here to rest and spend some time with myfamily. Ridiculous. Did you do your best? Ensign, this is a serious responsibility. Mister Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us totalk. I agree. Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason forhis actions. You do, Number One? Which somehow resulted in complex strings of water moleculeswhich acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain likealcohol. Data, download this information to Medical immediately. It's a dampening field. This entire structure could be shieldedfrom our sensors. Let's go. Well, that is a little vague. What is the computer analysis? There are aspects to Riva of which we have not been informed. But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems. The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go onso long. I see. Well, get them up here. Leaving school? No, you're not. JR Mister Data? But, your honour! I'll handle this. No, no, not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman. Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of the others? They'llall die when the cargo bay hatch is blown. Ensign, how bad is it? The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-calledwormhole. None that I can see. Mister La Forge. Then let's get to it. Mister Data? Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander? How could this happen? Take us out of warp. Establish parallel course. Match speed. Data, identify. What is a QE Two? We'll wait a bit more, Number One. Yes, Mister Data. A wise man once said, there is a sucker bornevery minute. Good. I understand from Mister La Forge there's a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil. Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl'sprotector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personalrelationships of those under my command, but in this case. We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require. The pain's gone. Mister Data? Apparently the Tamarians arrived atEl-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They have been transmitting asubspace signal towards Federation space ever since. The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related towhat's happening? Q Agreed. Will, if you were dying, if you were terminally ill with an incurable disease and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain, wouldn't you come to look on death as a release? Where is he now? You were not affected? Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed. Well, I'm sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and you requiremedical attention. Lieutenant Worf, will you accompany SublieutenantSetal to the Sickbay. We will attend to your quarters. Mister Data, how long until we clearCardassian space? Well, it could be nothing more than the result of a sleeplessnight. But let's be sure. Have Data and Geordi run a shipwidediagnostic, concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices,and we'll discuss the results tomorrow at seven hundred hours. I know that! Why can't you get out? Ensign? What in heaven's name? Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Q We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have youmade a decision? Why didn't you break a few rules? So what have you concluded? Does she live or does she die? Q I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be inthat escape pod, or what happened to the ship? Oh, yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates. This is Nails, from Chicago. And this is That's why they're asking for you. Not for your militaryproficiency, but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat. Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on thisfrequency? On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're ina position to compromise the security of the Federation. A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on theEnterprise. What unit? But everything started when we found the Brittain? What's the next step, Mister Data? Ah, yes, er, the rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my troupe arein rehearsals for a new production. Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. Do you see any problemsconnected with this old starship coming in, Number One? Any information about the structure. And who speaks for his family now? And issue a general distress call. Yes, Mister Data, I know. I've had some unpleasant surprises. Will, this isn't a goodidea. Baran might grow suspicious. Why? Damage? I'd be happy to. Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? Well. Here we are, eh, Jono? No reason you're aware of. Graves, every man has his time. Every man, without exception. But you've cheated. You have extended your life at the expense ofanother. Graves, give Data back. Give him back. I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run itscourse. And, Mister Worf? I hope you find what you're looking for. Let it come, let it come. Activate the main viewer. We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim atrisk. I want every possible security measure taken to protect thatperson. What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Q What was that? What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? Idon't see that those would be any more effective. Another malfunction? How do you know all this? This is not unlike a drumhead trial. It could have been damaged by the explosion. They may have beenable to maintain orbit. Yes, you do. You're a culture of one, which is no less validthan a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding yourexperience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When welook at Michaelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb and we don't ask whatdoes this mean to other people. The real question is, what does it meanto us? Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focuson it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you. Yes. My Chief Medical Officer has explored all other probablecauses. Why didn't I hear anything about a launching? I don't want any distractions. You, stay here. And what was this programme designed to do? At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. Astonishing to see it frozen like this. One half impulse. If you don't release the hostages, I won't cooperate. Yes. Quite. Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, youknow as well as I do I would never have graduated if you Nothing more? Stand by, Ensign. A singer? I look forward to reading your report, Commander. Atleast, I think I do. Well then, let's move on to the environmental gains on VentaxTwo. How were those accomplished How long can you maintain it? Picard to Doctor Crusher. Yes, of course you do. You have an excellent record. However,here on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You will reportyour observations to Lieutenant Worf. Now, quickly. If the changes in Doctor Pulaski's werereversed, would it be possible Get him out of there. Confirmed. Do it. Commander, have you been able to determine the cause of thewarp breach? This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Nowwho gave you that order? If the tremors have frightened people, leading to this hysteriaover Ardra, let us reassure them. Well, now, this is rather unusual for you to be curious aboutan away mission. Any problems? That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. Q Of course. You have the Bridge. You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike thetwo of you actually are. The Ambassador is sceptical, but he cares agreat deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success,he's prepared to pursue it. We can no longer afford to be patient. Unless we act soon,Esoqq will starve. Splendid, Data. Splendid. You're getting better and better. A defect that you hadn't noticed before? That being? Q How may we be of assistance, Ambassador? Mister La Forge. Agreed. Enlarge and identify. Report. Could he be some kind of android? A cellular fossil? It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you dosomething like that again? I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothinghappens to obstruct this mission. I wonder what they're thinking over there. What is the status of the enginereplacement? And that they will not kill unless their survival is at stake? Geordi. Jono? You all right? Ian, could you tell us why you are here? Come. Doctor Timicin. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge. As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there myresponsibility ends, but you, you have to stay with them through theentire grieving process. It's only possible use could be as aweapon. Mister La Forge, you will lead the away team over to the scout. Commander, you and Counsellor Troi will conduct Setal's interrogation. Then find it. A ruling with such broad ranging implicationsmust be supported. Phillipa, I hope you will use the same zeal that youdid in the Stargazer court martial. I came here to talk to Data. Then sending them back would be a death sentence. Can we help them? Is there any way we can moderate the powertransfer? If you have hurt any of my people Q During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seemthat we have at least one thing in common. I've only had a chance to glance at them. I've a few ideas. Abort and destroy. Is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so I canget a power boost? Very strange, Number One. Like going back to the house you grewup in, but no one's home, except the phantoms of the past. You are outrageous. No, no, but I was going to. I would have told him anything. Anything at all. But more than that, I believed that I could see fivelights. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Freighter, we're going to lock on the tractor beam and pull youout of orbit. That should make it about here. You read all this, telepathically? Liko! She knows exactly what she's doing. Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed of climbinginside the bottle? Come. Q Well, then we have no other choice. Nevertheless, we appear to be facing Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago,Admiral. It sounds as though they may require the services of a doctor. Mister Data, the asteroid we destroyed. That was rich innitrium. No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother forthe fine Counsellor she Will you meet Commander Data on the Bridge. He has our ordersand new heading. Commander Riker. Data, what's going on? Mister Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle ofnon interference. As Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath touphold that principle whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I mustrefuse your request. You want to repair them, you'll have to learn to do ityourselves. No, it takes several seconds to materialise. You wouldn't standa chance. Breakfast? Well, keep that option ready. In the meantime, proceed with theanalysis. Doctor, may I see you in my Ready room? I know how busy you are. Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of 'Demons of Air andDarkness'. Return that moon to its orbit. Q Every living thing on the planet will perish. Keep me informed of any changes, no matter how small. Captain's log, supplemental. I've been informedthat Mister Data has recovered the logs from the duplicateshuttlecraft. I am more than apprehensive to play back a log which willnot be recorded for several hours. It's quite all right. It must be important, or you wouldn't behere. If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out latertonight, and then he'll want revenge. Q I insist. When you've finished showing the Admiralanything that he needs, you can join me down on Earth. Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It wouldseem to suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. Yes, Data. I want you to prepare a class one probe. Set thesensors for maximum scan. I want every metre of Nelvana Threemonitored. Admit what, Mister Data? Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles? It seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial rightnow. We need to find out who we are and well, what we're doing outhere. But Data, they were already dead. I mean, what more could havehappened to them? Computer, route all command functions to the Bridge. Mister Data, are they in working condition? We will no longer share in this pointless fantasy of yours. Q At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious oldman. Mister La Forge, see if you can move us away from thedisturbance. Report, Number One. If he can't make a full recovery, Worf will to kill himself. Are you, are you children all right? Then she has done us both a disservice. I am committed topeace. Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Mister Worf, but Starfleetbelieves that the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same. One moment, Lieutenant. Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. Did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions, giveyou an idea of what he expected? Wonderful. Q And Commander Data in particular? Set a course to. A marshal of France? Ridiculous! Q How many on board? How about a war? If generations of conflict is killingmillions, do we interfere? Ah, well, now we're all a little less securein our moral certitude. And what if it's not just killings. If anoppressive government is enslaving millions? You see, the PrimeDirective has many different functions, not the least of which is toprotect us. To prevent us from allowing our emotions to overwhelm ourjudgement. Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis andcancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time that I wasgoing. He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all hewanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. Iwish he could find some focus in his life. Exactly what? If that is your wish, we will respect it. Granted. I offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. Make it so. Professor. It's good to see you again. Understood. Open hailing frequencies. Status, Number One? Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break throughit. I want that man on this ship. what is it you want, Q? Q Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis. Well, perhaps we'vegot a tempest in a test tube, after all. Get off my bridge! Q Mister Data, is it at all likely that the Vico could have beenattacked inside the cluster? A distress call from a ship called the Kallisko. It's beingpursued by an unknown object. Tell me, where is Lieutenant Commander Data? The correct procedure, Are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors? Number One! We've got to find some way to stop this system. Yes, but where is this place? You know, Number One, you missed something not playing withmodel ships. They were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding atreasure of adventures. Manning the earliest space craft, flying aaeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Can youimagine that? Now the machines are flying us. There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? Stop engines. Easy, we don't want to alarm or provoke it. On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. Theywould learn about alien worlds, starships. Data, the shrieking noise you made. It causes them pain. We've been ordered to learn all we can about them. Do you knowa better way? I'm curious about how this rare form of communication cameabout. So, old friend. How are you? Batai? Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. I cannot. Splendid. How do we bypass the security system? Of course. This will be fine. So now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do? No. Wait. The plan failed because clues were left behind thatsuggested a mystery. And to many humans, a mystery isirresistible. It must be solved. The Doctor's incubation experiment,Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations. Little pieces of evidence thatsuggested even more clues. The clock, the transporter trace, Data's oddbehaviour. If we eliminate the clues and begin again Alone, Number One. What did you say? Cadet Haro. I'm not from Nottingham. What is it trying to learn? You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal andrecently you've been ordering these elaborate things. To expose a child to this. To someone who is suffering. To seethat it is you that inflict that suffering. That is an understatement, Number One. The last time I sawCommander Flaherty, he spoke forty languages. As I recall, among themore exotic were Romulan, Klingon, Giamon, Stroyerian. Mister Kurland, you are not going to die out there. You aregoing to do exactly what I tell you. Now, take the nose of theshuttlecraft and aim it directly at Relva Seven. Helm, move us closer. Ten million kilometres. I'm sure of it. Security to Captain's quarters immediately. Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents. This is the second time that you have shown surprise at myappearance, Kevin. The first time was understandable, but now? Unlessit is because you never expected to see me again. Simply speaking, we don't trust you. Q What's the prognosis? Come. That was Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign. Please follow hisinstructions. One of my officers, one of my friends, was troubled. I had tohelp. Is Sarjenka safely home? Yes, but you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you knowwho I am? No, you don't, do you. P2 Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel is approaching. It will be herewithin three hours. We can return you to the crash site, where theywill find you and take then you home. Or, if you wish, you can stayhere with us. I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that wehave another option. Very well, let's give it a try. Are you saying someone was communicating telepathically? Who are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close rangefrom a camouflaged observation post. Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage, whatever. Theanswer's there, on the planet. Tasha, I want you to provide CounsellorTroi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests. Psychprofiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent, thepsychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another. I believe I have the best part of that bargain, Ambassador. Peace and long life. Go on. Can we transport through the interference? How are the survey preparations coming along? But futilely. Agreed, DaiMon Tarr. You should be able to view us now. Are weon your screen? If you are who you say you are, there's no need for any ofthis. We'll gladly take you home. In what way have we mistreated her? I know. Do you know where you are? P2 You think you're going to be killed? Q, is there any point to all this? Q Of course. So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle. A few hours on board and already she's found Ten forward. Status, Mister La Forge. The crew is saddened by your loss, Mister Data. So what's their condition? And I do not want to kill you. I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spentsome time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it stillremains a mystery. The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, werethey? Commander MacDuff, set a course for the Lysian Central Command. Oh, for God's sake, Walker. This is a secured channel May I know your reason? And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct MisterWorf? Good, since we admire what we've seen of your constructiontechniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbaseselsewhere also. That thought has crossed our minds. Your god up there mayinsist that we obey our non-interference directive. Walker! Not now, damn it, Q. Hello, old friend. Slow to impulse. The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of theartefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. Iwanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar onDessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me. They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation. Who is Pardek? I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum. I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probablyinitiated over a thousand years ago. Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived atOrelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars andPromellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we havefound a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood thecenturies. You led us quite a chase, Mister Crusher. Doctor Crusher. This is close enough, Ensign. Hold this position. Then let us hope they do not believe their survival is atstake. Picard to Transporter room three Life? Set course for Gagarin Four, warp seven. Number One, find out if anything similar happened in thissector. Is there an intelligence causing this interference? They will live their lives and never know any difference. Tholl, what I want is for everyone to escape! Keep me informed. Give me a chance to put things back the way they were before. Q Yes. No doubt, but they will pass. Van Doren's technique has been perfected totwo point four percent. I would like to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us. That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, withMasaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her. It appears that I am not immune to the strange forces that areat work on this ship. You're speaking of yourself, Q, not Guinan. Q But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take partin that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich culturalheritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival. Granted. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. Take us back, Number One. Why not? Whatever game you want to play will have to wait untiltomorrow. Q Lieutenant La Forge, status report. Continue, Doctor. Invite him, Mister Data. This is supposed to be a recreationalactivity. The sense of reality was absolutely incredible. When thatwoman kissed me, it was so Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander. Where else would I be? So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing anyfurther. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, thisexperiment is over! Lifesigns? Of course. We look forward to seeing you, Admiral. Enterpriseout. Quinn wants to see us alone. At least we know he's still on ourside. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. What? Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site, youknow. It's a Federation outpost there. Lieutenant La Forge has a thought. He believes we can phaser aslice in the field Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Pleaseproceed. No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But theProfessor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices insidethe one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voiceinside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that. Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready. Will. How the hell do I advise you? Youknow the implications as well as I. At your convenience, Mister Data. Please. Let me give you a hand. Is that so? Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez, I think it will besimpler if I simply change my uniform. Simultaneously? All eighteen? Apparently not. Course one four eight. Correction, course one seven zero markzero one four. No. Actually, I do need to get out of here. Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You are toremain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of thisvoyage. Is that clear? Starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation hasdeveloped. Mordan Four has finally gained peace after decades of civilwar Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren. Oh? Method acting? I'm vaguely familiar with it, but why would youchoose such an old-fashioned approach? Then perhaps you would share them with me, Ensign. Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up somestartling results. Will you join us, Lieutenant? To lose sixteen years. It's almost beyondbelief. Who are you? We haven't found a way to transport you back yet. Riker, can you read me? Ensign, when should the results be known? Well, I've done everything that Geordisaid. Now to activate it. On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data. I'm aware of that, Doctor. Maques, what were you doing in Sickbay? Tragedy seems to follow that family. The Admiral lost both hersons. Lieutenant Worf has served under my command with distinction. He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish thatthis Council, in its wisdom, will clear his family name and return himto duty. Doctor, programme the computer to analyse the distribution ofthe pieces that we have, correcting for changes in star configurationsover four billion years, then extrapolate for the missing piece. Ensign, prepare to beam our guests and their cargo down toOrnara. Can we get within transporter range without crossing intoCardassian territory? DaiMon, your ship was adrift, your communications inoperative. We were attempting to assess your status. Notify Starfleet we are en route to the Xanthras system for ourrendezvous with the Zapata. I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? Mister La Forge, can you implement your tachyon detection gridwith twenty ships? Are you reading anything, Doctor? We know from our own experience that our shields will protectus. So long as we're in no danger, I will make every effort tocommunicate. I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Commander Riker tojoin me as soon as he's ready. Picard out. Your clarity of thought. Your objectivity, as always. Sit down. Data, it's very possible we are about to go to war. The repercussionsof what we do during the next twenty four hours may be felt for yearsto come. I want you to keep a record of these events, so that historywill have the benefit of a dispassionate view. Now. Am I to understand the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise? Doctor, if you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it afew hours ago. All the crew members were dead. Perhaps a different level of consciousness? And you recognised him? Q, what is it you want? Q What the hell is going on? Sovereign Marouk, welcome to the Bridge. Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? No one suggested otherwise, Counsellor. Mister Data, try toisolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps there'll be abasis for communication. Mister La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jumpas soon as you're prepared. That'll be all. Counsellor Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time? The inertial dampers shouldn't fail without kicking in theautomatic bypass. I want to know what went wrong. Analysis in thirtyminutes. On screen. But it's a likely hypothesis, Number One. If Commander La Forgehas located a second survivor. Lieutenant, hail the Romulan vessel. Yes, Lieutenant. On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I mustrespectfully decline. Enterprise C? She was lost at the battle of Narendra Three,defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans. On viewer. Data, can you speculate as to the purpose of thesereassignments? Let them. Ensign, bring us to within twenty kilometres of the test ship. And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you. Please, help yourselves to something to eat. Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion withyour mother. Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems. Atthe moment, we are adrift. And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since acaptain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what Iproject. Now, are we progressing, Mister La Forge? Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. Here too. I'm on my way. Ensign, full stop. And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhapsyou and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. No. Locate Lieutenant Commander Data. You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much Iadmire his son. Hello, Alexandra. Go to warp two. This goes against my better judgment. Transporter room three,lock on to shuttle one. Beam it back into it's bay. We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. How many ofyour men do you want to accompany you? We have to know what's going on But that's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're quite a distance from either of theirterritories. Go ahead, Geordi. Unfortunately, I can't, Mister A long time to wait to see if you're right. Commander? Wesley, it's a little more complicated than that. Unfortunately the results would not be available for severaldays, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference. Right. Now, to my right is a larger triangular screen. The topis solid amber. To the left, red. All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon Mister Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will youescort her to Sickbay. Sarek of Vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight atsomething he did not want to see. That's true. But I have seen my share of death. We'll try and put an end to this fromhere. It is our intent to prevent any external power from interferingin Klingon affairs. Fine. You want to be treated as a human? Q Indeed? Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now. Reconsider your decision. Commander Riker, report to the Bridge. Cycle power through ventral relay. If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else toreturn to the ship, but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. Phasers and sensors both useless? Mister Data, this reflectionphenomenon, would it have the same effect on a disruptor-style weapon? Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmlands here. Now access the file. Start the transfer. Why didn't you mention this earlier? Mister Crusher, stow that with the medical supplies. Keep youreye on it. All right, we're going to explore the cave. Mister Crusher,look for any signs of water, no matter how faint. Captain Dirgo, willyou lead the way? Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Dojhon. Doj hon. Permission granted. Qapla' But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trustme. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child buildingthose model starship engines. They were well worth it. No, that won't be necessary, Mister Worf. I'm not here as yourcaptain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the HighCouncil. Your cha'DIch. We will arrive at your home world in less thana day. Why not? An algorithm? Are you saying that these fragments areelements in some kind of computerprogramme? Thank you, Mister Data. Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk yourlife to lead it personally? Metaphysics? Patched is good enough. Well done. Beamback immediately. It's all right. They're called lynars, a kind of Celtrine bat. They're harmless. Number One, come in. Transporter Room, this is the Captain. Weare out of contact with the away team. Beam them back immediately. I think that the Romulans are just hoping to create adistraction. They want to keep us off balance. The question are, why now? What's their objective? For fiftyyears there's barely a whisper out of them, and now for no apparentreason they seem to be back with a roar. Stand by for transport. Picard out. Mister Worf, have allsecurity precautions been taken? It will require the cooperation of allconcerned. Very good, Geordi. Let me know if you Mister Riker? Mister Crusher, set course for the Acamar system. Data, please sit down. Well, we have a problem. For the first time since I've known you, I don't believe you. On my way, Number One. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek ® and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrightsproperty of their respective holders. We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you. Worf, the next few days will be difficultfor you Thank you, Counsellor. 2 Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. But youall right though? Belay that order, Mister Data. I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on. Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as youare, he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do. Maybe. Enough ofthis self-indulgence. Exit. The Ambassador's very busy. Commander La Forge will be entirely at your disposal,Ambassador. So, where exactly is the location? In a month, the metagenic agent itself breaks down anddissipates completely, leaving every city, every road, every piece ofequipment perfectly intact. Hello, old friend. Come. But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory,the sense of individuality which he has gained here might betransmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of theBorg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling ofsingularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious programme of all. Theknowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that briefmoment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact. You have the Bridge, Number One. Prime Minister, even the most comfortable prison is a prison. Governor. Ambassador. They haven't always, but now they do. I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of theEnterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you. Starfleet hasclassified the Cor Caroli Five plague as secret. No cadet would haveknowledge of that incident. You mentioned a hospitalisation. Mister Fajo, thank you for your help. For me, too. Hailing frequencies. So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elementsof its own culture. A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. Whatreport on the logs? I want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams. Were Amanda's parents executed by the Q Continuum? Q On screen. I would suggest you ask your friend the Cardassian liaison,Admiral. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassiansstaged it. No. We're on our way, Lieutenant. But if you go back, it could be a great deal more helpful. Thewar is going very badly for the Federation, far worse than is generallyknown. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within sixmonths we may have no choice but to surrender. Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirtyminutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. Picard out. We're out here to explore, to make contact with other lifeforms, to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere. Andabsolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done. Yes, Data. What is it? Do it. Doctor Jo'Bril, listen to me. It is imperative that you turnthe shuttle. Take it out of the corona. Do you understand me? Pilot theshuttle away from the star. Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to thewishes of their Captain? Obviously, he's trying to alter the programming here. We believe that they were trying to extract strategicinformation from your memory using a neurosomatic technique. The loss is mine, Ambassador. Did you input that new code? What? Doctor Pulaski. Under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind. Come. As a result, we won't be able to rendezvouswith the Kearsarge for another four days. Yes, Mrs. Carmichael. Maximum shields, ready all weapon systems. I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Q If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their humanrights. I want to be here when he presents it. Transporter two, prepare to beam the occupant of the scout shipdirectly aboard. Hey. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? Yes, of course, Number One. Just a little preoccupied. Data, what information can you give us about the inhabitants ofthis system? I don't trust you, Q. Why should I expect Amanda to? Q Cattle, chickens, pigs. Not DNA, the actual livestock. Incredible. Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo? Hey. Good man. First Officer's log, stardate 44307.6. Radiationlevels on the Enterprise continue to rise. The ventilation system hasstarted pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract theeffects. Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole? Still no visual contact. That's impossible. Mister Worf, same magnification fifty degrees starboard. A revolving door? Number One, proceed withcaution. Theorise, Data. What are his limits? We are aware of that, Electorine. Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton fielddisturbance? You've got a good crop here. As I recall, it's not easy tocultivate. My God. Phillipa Louvois. And back inuniform. It's been ten years, but seeing you again like this makes itseem like fifty. If we weren't around all these people, do you knowwhat I would like to do? They won't protect you any longer. All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you. Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what youneeded. Torture has never been a reliable means of extractinginformation. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. Onewonders that it's still practiced. I see why you were so eager to find it. Then the Romulans could still be in the vicinity. Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf? Hold on, Jake. It's going to be a little bumpy. That's what the reports said about Mendez and Hickman beforethey disappeared. How long before we can return to warp power? Your experience on board the Pagh will prove invaluable duringthe commander's tour. Be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusualorders. What do you want? Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? The foreign investors in the book aredescribed as flamboyantly generous. Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy. Someone with a reason for confining us here. Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do Iask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday onCorsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of athousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believethat if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is myfuture and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet. I have no idea what you're talking about. Q Excuse me. Set your phaser to heavy stun.
